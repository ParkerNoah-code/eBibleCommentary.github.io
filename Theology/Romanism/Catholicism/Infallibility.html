    <p>
      The Vatican Council, which met in Rome, in 1870, defined the doctrine of
      the infallibility of the pope as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “...We teach and define that it is a dogma divinely revealed that the
      Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when in discharge of
      the office of pastor and doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his
      supreme Apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith and
      morals to be held by the universal Church, by the divine assistance
      promised him in blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with
      which the divine Redeemer willed that His Church should be endowed for
      defining doctrines regarding faith and morals, and that therefore such
      definitions of the Roman Pontiff of themselves—and not by virtue of the
      consent of the Church—are irreformable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To this pronouncement there was attached the inevitable anathema of the
      church on all who dare to disagree:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if any one—which may God forbid!—presume to contradict this our
      definition: let him be anathema:”
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be noticed that in this pronouncement there are three important
      restrictions: (1) infallibility is not claimed for every statement made by
      the pope, but only for those made when he is speaking ex cathedra, that
      is, seated in his papal chair, the chair of St. Peter, and speaking in his
      official capacity as the head of the church;<sup>1</sup> (2) the
      pronouncement must be intended as binding on the whole
      church—infallibility is not claimed for statements addressed to particular
      segments or groups within the church which may relate more or less to
      local conditions; and (3) the pronouncements must have to do with matters
      pertaining to “faith and morals.” In actual practice, however, the term
      “faith and morals” is broad enough and elastic enough to cover almost any
      and every phase of religious and civil life. Practically every public
      issue can be looked upon as having some bearing on faith or morals or
      both. The Vatican takes full advantage of this, and the result is that
      within the Roman Church almost any statement issued by the pope is assumed
      to be authoritative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> A scientific commission appointed by Pope Paul VI in July,
      1968, to investigate the antiquity of the “Chair of St. Peter,” using
      modern scientific methods for dating old objects, reported early 1969 that
      the chair dates from the late ninth century. It is of French origin. There
      is some evidence that it was the coronation chair of Charles II, king of
      France, known as Charles the Bald, who was crowned in Rome on Christmas
      day, 875, by John VIII, in an attempt to restore the Western (Holy Roman)
      empire. Hence while it may have historical and symbolical value, it is not
      an antique of the first century.

    <h2>The Nature of the Pope’s Infallibility</h2>
    <p>
      The doctrine of papal infallibility does not mean that the pope is
      infallible as a man. It does not relate to his personal habits. It does
      not mean that he is sinless. Nor does it mean that he is inspired as were
      the apostles so that he can write Scripture. It means rather that in his
      official capacity as teacher of the church he has the guidance of the Holy
      Spirit so that he can interpret and state clearly and positively doctrines
      which allegedly have been a part of the heritage of the church from the
      beginning. Theoretically he cannot produce new doctrines, but some of the
      decrees issued have had that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the alleged infallibility cannot relate to personal morals is
      perfectly clear in the light of history. We merely state a fact when we
      say that some of the popes have been grossly immoral. That was one of the
      contributing factors in the rapid progress of the Protestant Reformation.
      Roman Catholic historians readily admit these facts. Some of the popes
      have been so illiterate that it would be absurd to attribute to them
      scholarly ability sufficient to propound doctrine. Even Cardinal
      Bellarmine, a Jesuit and a papal champion, now a canonized saint,
      frequently warned Pope Clement VIII (1592-1605) that, not being a
      theologian, he could not expect to understand the Molinist controversy
      (concerning semi-Pelagianism). Words such as those of Pius V (1566-1572),
      to the effect that all the Huguenots should be exterminated, are explained
      away on the ground that in such cases the pope was not speaking ex
      cathedra.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to notice that the popes, in issuing their decrees or
      pronouncements, do not label them ex cathedra or not ex cathedra. We may
      be sure that if this power were a reality they would not hesitate so to
      label them, that in fact they would find it very advantageous to do so.
      Surely it would be of inestimable value to know which deliverances are ex
      cathedra and which are not, which are infallible and authoritative and
      which are only private observations and therefore as fallible as those of
      anyone else. It seems impossible to secure such a list. We may safely
      assume that the proclamation of Pope Pius XII regarding the assumption of
      the Virgin Mary (1950) was ex cathedra. According to some Roman Catholic
      writers such utterances are relatively infrequent. It is also interesting
      to notice that neither the Church of Rome in her corporate capacity, nor
      any of her infallible popes, have ever given the world the benefit of
      their sanctity and infallibility in a commentary on the Bible, which
      assuredly would be a blessing of inestimable value. In fact they have
      never published an infallible exposition of even one chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then is anyone to know whether any given pronouncement is ex cathedra
      and therefore infallible? The pope presumably would be the most likely
      person to know his own intentions. How does he distinguish between
      pronouncements? Can he call up this peculiar kind of inspiration at any
      time? Does he have a particular sensation or feeling of any kind when
      exercising it?
    </p>
    <p>
      A rather amusing aspect of this whole affair is the extreme reluctance of
      all the popes since 1870, when this decree went into effect, to use this
      amazing gift. The church and the world have passed through many
      controversies and have been faced with many perplexing problems in the
      solution of which some infallible pronouncements with divine authority
      behind them would have been of inestimable blessing. But instead the
      hierarchy as well as others have often been perplexed and have made many
      mistakes—we need recall only such events as the support given by the
      Vatican to Mussolini in his rise to power and in his military campaigns in
      Ethiopia and Spain, the concordat signed with Hitler, and the unfailing
      support given the Spanish dictator Franco since he first came to power.
      During these perplexing times the popes have been as confused as anyone
      else. They have merely issued “encyclicals” (formal letters, in Latin,
      addressed to all the bishops), for which no infallibility is claimed, and
      which can be modified or set aside by a successor. But of what conceivable
      value is papal infallibility unless it be to insure clarity and certainty
      of statement when circumstances make it desirable that the church should
      speak with authority? Furthermore, the procedure now followed when a pope
      wants to make an important statement is that he asks certain theologians
      or bishops to make a study of the subject and to give him their report.
      The report is then submitted to many others, whose opinions over a long
      period of time are considered. Last of all he decides on the matter. But
      if he possesses the attribute of infallibility why should he consult with
      theologians and bishops who individually are subject to error? Why is he
      not able to make the pronouncement merely upon his own authority? We take
      this reluctance as prima facie evidence that all concerned know that in
      reality no such infallibility exists, and that they do not want to run the
      risk of being discredited by such statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average Roman Catholic layman usually assumes that anything the pope
      puts in writing relating to faith and morals is as infallible as if it had
      been uttered by Christ Himself. But representative churchmen are more
      cautious and warn that it is not easy to distinguish between ex cathedra
      and non-ex cathedra statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion that any human being is in any way infallible does not commend
      itself to the mind of a Christian. To most people such a claim does not
      seem worthy of serious consideration. There can hardly be any more brazen
      exhibition of arrogance, bigotry, and intolerance than this claim that the
      pope, who in reality is a mere man, is the very mouthpiece of God on
      earth, God’s sole deputy, and that he can impose dogmatic decrees under
      pain of excommunication and death in this life and the loss of eternal
      salvation in the next. How true the words of England’s Lord Acton, himself
      a Roman Catholic, who after visiting Rome and seeing at firsthand the
      workings of the papacy wrote: “All power corrupts, and absolute power
      corrupts absolutely.”
    </p>
    <p>
      How utterly different is this attitude of the popes from that of Peter, in
      whose succession they claim to follow, who humbly called himself a
      “fellow-elder” and who warned so clearly against “lording it over the
      charge allotted to you” (1 Peter 5:1-3)! And, more importantly, how
      utterly different from the attitude set forth by Christ, who said: “Ye
      know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great
      ones exercise authority over them. Not so shall it be among you: but
      whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; and
      whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant: even as the Son
      of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his
      life a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:25-28).
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of infallibility appeals to many people who are poorly
      informed and who are adrift spiritually. These people know practically
      nothing about the Bible. Consequently, they have no sound theology on
      which to base their actions. Oftentimes they are bewildered by the
      conflicting claims of the various churches and by the disappointing
      conduct of some church members. Particularly in the spiritual realm a
      state of uncertainty is a state of misery, so the Roman Church finds this
      situation ideally suited for her purpose. She skillfully presents her
      claims to speak with divine authority, and it is not surprising that there
      are those who respond. These people are fascinated by the call of a church
      which promises stability and calm. If the priest or the church says a
      thing is all right, then for them it is all right. Their consciences are
      relieved in that they no longer have to worry about the right or wrong of
      certain actions. They tend to surrender without first examining the
      promised certainty, only to find after it is too late that they have been
      cruelly deceived and that they cannot surrender their consciences to the
      rule of any man or church.

    <h2>Infallibility Not Taught in the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      The silence of Scripture concerning an infallible church or concerning
      Peter as an infallible pope is sufficient to disprove the idea. Yet the
      most prominent characteristic of the papacy, the thing that sets it apart
      from all other churches, is its claim to supremacy, authority,
      infallibility. Had there been an infallible source of authority in the
      church, it is inconceivable that Peter, the alleged bishop of Rome,
      writing two general epistles and mentioning his departure which he
      indicated was close at hand (2 Peter 1:13), would not have acquainted the
      members of the church as to what guide or authority they were to follow
      after he was taken from them, or how that guide or authority was to be
      chosen. But he does not even mention the subject. On the other hand Christ
      and the apostles warned against false Christs, false prophets, false
      teachers who would arise and make such claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible says: “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are
      sons of God” (Romans 8:14). But the Church of Rome demands that all follow
      blindly and with implicit faith the interpretation of the Bible given by
      the pope and his hierarchy. In doing so it usurps the place of the Holy
      Spirit as teacher and leader. That Peter, the alleged first pope, was not
      infallible as a teacher of faith and morals is evident from his conduct at
      Antioch when he refused to eat with Gentile Christians lest he offend
      certain Jews from Jerusalem (Galatians 2:11-16). Instead, he would have
      fastened the ritual requirements of Judaism on the new Christian Church.
      This should have been no problem at all for him if he had the special
      guidance of the Holy Spirit claimed by the Church of Rome for the pope.
      Furthermore, if any one of the apostles was to be chosen as the infallible
      head of the church, it would seem that that one should have been Paul, and
      not Peter. For both as a man and as a teacher Paul was a far greater
      personality. But the fact is that the New Testament nowhere gives the
      slightest indication that any man was to be chosen for that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament, in addition to the two letters written by Peter, we
      have thirteen written by Paul. But in none of those does he refer to Peter
      as the bishop of Rome, or of any other church. In Paul’s most important
      letter, that to the church of Rome, he does not so much as mention Peter.
      In his letter to Timothy he mentions the office of bishop or elder, but he
      does not mention that of archbishop, supreme bishop, or pope. Surely if
      such an important office as supreme bishop or pope existed, he would have
      mentioned it. Nor in the literature of the early church during the second
      or third century is there any mention of a supreme bishop or pope. There
      are references to Christ as the Chief Shepherd, but none to any man as
      having that or any similar title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that we have our infallible rule of faith and morals in the
      New Testament Scriptures. And having that it is not necessary to bestow
      infallibility on any man. For one who wants to know the truth, we point
      him to the Scriptures and say: “Here it is. Believe and practice what is
      taught here and you will live. The one who turns aside from this rule will
      not have life.”

    <h2>History of the Doctrine before 1870</h2>
    <p>
      We may well ask: If the doctrine of infallibility was taught by Christ or
      by any of the apostles, why did the Roman Catholic Church wait for more
      than eighteen centuries before giving it acknowledgment? Dr. Geddes
      MacGregor, in his book, The Vatican Revolution, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In spite of the early recognition of the importance of the See of Rome
      and the consequent prestige of its bishop, there is not even a hint of an
      ex cathedra notion before the eleventh century. Even in the fourteenth, in
      the lively debates on the nature of papal pronouncements, no such common
      notion was being either combatted or upheld” (p. 137).
    </p>
    <p>And Edward J. Tanis, in his booklet, What Rome Teaches , says:</p>
    <p>
      “Ireneus, who was a disciple of Polycarp (a disciple of John the apostle),
      died about the year 200. He knew what the early church believed and
      taught, and he wrote many books against heresies of various kinds, but
      Ireneus never taught that Christ intended any bishop to be the infallible
      head of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tertullian was the greatest theologian of the early church before
      Augustine, the learned scholar who developed the doctrine of the Trinity,
      emphasizing the equality of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He died in
      the year 220. If any man knew what Christ and the apostles taught,
      Tertullian knew it. But Tertullian never heard of an infallible head of
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of the ablest scholars in the early church was Jerome , who died in
      420. He provided the church with a new and better translation of the
      Scriptures and until this day his Latin translation of the Bible has been
      in use in the Roman Catholic Church, evidence that this scholar is held in
      high esteem among Roman Catholics. But even so great a scholar did not
      teach that the church had an infallible head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gregory the Great was one of the most powerful and influential popes,
      bishop of the congregation in Rome from 590 to 604. He made a large
      contribution to the improvement of the preaching and music of the church
      and was an ardent defender of the Catholic traditions, but Gregory never
      taught that he was the infallible head of the whole church.
      Foakes-Jackson, the scholarly historian quotes Gregory the Great as saying
      that the title of pope as ‘Ecumenical Bishop’ (bishop of the whole church)
      was ‘proud and foolish’ and ‘an imitation of the devil’” (p. 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The clear teaching of history is that the office of pope was a gradual
      development. The early bishops in Rome knew nothing of it. They neither
      claimed the title nor exercised the power. But as time went on,
      particularly after the fall of the Roman empire, more and more power,
      political as well as ecclesiastical, fell into the hands of the bishop of
      Rome, and so the papacy developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For centuries before the doctrine of papal infallibility was adopted there
      was much difference of opinion as to where that infallibility lay. Some
      held that it rested in the councils speaking for the church. Two councils,
      that of Constance (1415), which deposed the first Pope John XXIII after he
      had held the office for five years and had appointed several cardinals and
      bishops who continued to hold their offices, and that of Basle (1432),
      declared that “even the pope is bound to obey the councils.” At another
      time it was held that infallibility lay in acts of the councils approved
      by the pope. But in 1870 it was declared to reside in the pope alone, and
      all good Roman Catholics now are compelled to accept that view. The
      Jesuits, because of their influence at the Vatican and their ability to
      influence the popes, supported that view. But the principal question
      remains: Which council pronouncement was “infallible,” that of Constance
      and Basle? Or that of the Vatican Council? Clearly they are contradictory
      and cannot both be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the popes have not always been considered infallible is made clear by
      a review of events in the late 14 th and early 15 th centuries. Such a
      survey is given by Dr. Harris as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the 1300’s the popes moved to Avignon, France, and for seventy years
      were manifestly subservient to the French kings. This has been called the
      ‘Babylonian Captivity’ of the papacy. Following this time, Gregory XI went
      back to Rome. His successor, Urban VI (1378-1389) made an election promise
      to return to France, but election promises are not always kept and he
      later refused. The French then called his election illegal and elected a
      new rival pope, Clement VII (1378-1394). This continued until a council
      was called at Pisa in 1409 which deposed both rival popes and elected a
      new one, Alexander V (1409-1410). The rival popes refused to accept the
      council and so three popes were on the scene. After the death of Alexander
      V, he was succeeded by John XXIII, whom Roman Catholics do not acknowledge
      and whose name the present pope has taken to show the illegality of the
      first John XXIII. Roman Catholics do not accept the Council of Pisa as an
      ecumenical council (that is, one representative of the whole church). But
      most of them accept Alexander V whom it elected! (Hefele, History of the
      Church Councils , Vol. I, p. 58). The Council of Pisa declared that a
      council is superior to a pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The schism continued and the Council of Constance (1414-1418) was called.
      This council deposed all three popes and elected a new one, Martin V
      (1417-1431). ... The Council of Constance also declared that a council is
      superior to a pope, and thus it acted to depose three popes at once.
      Hefele, one of the best known Roman authorities, takes the odd position
      that the first forty sessions of the council were not ecumenical but that
      sessions 41-45, presided over by Martin V whom they elected, were
      ecumenical. Martin proceeded to confirm all the decrees of the first forty
      sessions except those which minimized the papacy. Here, of course, was the
      pope’s dilemma. If the earlier sessions were valid, the Council was
      supreme over the pope. If not, the other popes were not deposed and Martin
      V was not rightly elected! The Vatican Council of 1870 declared: ‘They err
      from the right course who assert that it is lawful to appeal from the
      judgment of the Roman Pontiff to an ecumenical council, as to an authority
      higher than that of the Roman Pontiff.’ This is wonderful. The pope is
      higher than a council. The Vatican Council made him so! But a previous
      council, just as regular, had denied him to be so” (article, The Bible
      Presbyterian Reporter , December, 1958).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Constance declared that “every lawfully convoked ecumenical
      council representing the church derives its authority immediately from
      Christ, and every one, the pope included, is subject to it in matters of
      faith, in the healing of schism, and the reformation of the Church.” But
      the Vatican Council of 1870 has decreed that infallibility is vested in
      the pope as head of the church, when speaking ex cathedra.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times during the Middle Ages when the popes increased their
      power until they were the unquestioned rulers in both the church and the
      state. Some deposed kings and lesser civil officials, and could imprison
      or commit individuals to servitude for life. The decree of
      excommunication, directed against individuals, in which those
      excommunicated were cut off from the church and were placed outside the
      protection of the civil law, and the interdict, by which whole nations
      were branded as outlaws and placed under the ban, were terrible things.
      Some popes took it upon themselves to declare any political action not
      pleasing to them null and void, as Innocent III did with Magna Carta after
      it had been won by the people of England from a despotic king, or as Pius
      V did in 1570 when he attempted to “uncrown” Queen Elizabeth I of England,
      and to release the people of England from allegiance to her. The Roman
      Catholic ideal is that the pope should be able to crown and uncrown kings,
      and that kings and other civil rulers should acknowledge that their power
      comes from God through the pope as God’s representative on earth. Where
      the Roman Church has been able to realize its ideal, it has made civil
      rulers vassals of the pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before 1870 the ultimate authority commonly acknowledged in the Roman
      Church was the church speaking through its councils. While the doctrine of
      papal infallibility had been discussed for some centuries, it had never
      met with general favor. Instead, it had been repugnant to many of the most
      eminent scholars and theologians and to a large majority of the hierarchy.
      For nearly two hundred years before the Vatican Council the Roman Catholic
      bishops, clergy, and laity of England and Ireland had denied that
      infallibility was a doctrine of the church. In 1825, for instance, when
      the restoration of political privileges to English Roman Catholics was
      under discussion in Parliament, a British government commission asked a
      panel of Irish Roman Catholics if the Roman Church held that the pope was
      infallible. The bishops correctly replied that it did not. On the basis of
      that assurance the privileges were restored. Two catechisms in general use
      before 1870 verify this position. Keenan’s A Doctrinal Catechism asks:
      “Must not Catholics believe the pope in himself to be infallible?” And the
      answer is: “This is a Protestant invention; it is no article of the
      Catholic faith; no decision of his can oblige, under pain of heresy,
      unless it is received and enforced by the teaching body, that is, the
      bishops of the church” (p. 305). When papal infallibility was decreed by
      Pope Pius IX in 1870, this question and answer were quietly omitted from
      the catechism without note, comment, or explanation. The Catechism of the
      Catholic Religion gave substantially the same reply (p. 87).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that Cardinal Newman was strongly opposed to the
      promulgation of the doctrine of infallibility. But having left the Church
      of England in order to join the Roman Church and having given it such
      fulsome praise, he was powerless to prevent the change and did not have
      the courage to come back out of it. Shortly before the decree was issued,
      he wrote to a friend, comparing the impending decree with that setting
      forth the Immaculate Conception which was issued in 1854: “As to the
      immaculate Conception, by contrast there was nothing sudden, or secret, in
      the proposal. ... This has taken us all by surprise.” And on January 18,
      1870, while the council was in session, he wrote to Bishop Ullathorne,
      deploring what seemed imminent, and asked: “What have we done to be
      treated as the Faithful never were treated before? Why should an
      aggressive and insolent faction [by which he meant the Jesuits] be allowed
      to make the hearts of the just to mourn whom the Lord hath not made
      sorrowful?” It was a bitter pill for Newman to swallow, but he submitted
      and acknowledged papal infallibility.

    <h2>The Vatican Council of 1870</h2>
    <p>
      The council which ratified the infallibility decree was clearly packed in
      favor of the Jesuit-controlled papal party. MacGregor, who has made a
      special study of this council and its effect on the Roman Church, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Out of the 541 prelates from Europe, the Italian peninsula, with a
      population of 27 million, was represented by 276, or 11 more than the
      whole of the rest of the continent including Britain and Ireland. ... Even
      more horrifying is the fact that those of the Papal States that had not at
      that time been seized, and which had a population of less than three
      quarters of a million, were represented by sixty-two bishops, while five
      million Roman Catholics elsewhere were represented by only three
      bishops—those of Paris, Cambrai and Cologne—all three critical of the
      standpoint of the papalist party. ... It was calculated in an anonymous
      pamphlet circulated in Rome after the Council had been in operation for
      five months and attributed to Mgr. Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, that one
      hundred ninety-one members of the Council had no constitutional right to
      be there at all” (The Vatican Revolution, p. 28-29).
    </p>
    <p>
      The church historian Philip Schaff says there was strong opposition to the
      call for the council, and that delegates representing 80 million Roman
      Catholics were opposed to it. A preliminary vote in secret session gave
      the delegates a limited opportunity to express themselves. Eighty-eight
      delegates voted against it, 65 voted for it with reservations, and over 80
      abstained. But the papal party was in firm control and easily carried the
      final voting. To take sides against the strong-willed pope and against the
      Jesuits a minority had to be particularly courageous to express itself at
      all. It was a foregone conclusion that the decree would be passed.
      Opposition clearly was futile, and could mean reprisals affecting the
      delegates’ present positions or injury to any chances for future
      promotion. Before the final vote was taken 410 bishops petitioned in favor
      of the dogma, and 162 against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who opposed the decree was the scholarly archbishop
      Strossmayer, who made a famous speech in which he declared boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have set myself to study with the most serious attention the Old and
      New Testaments, and I have asked these venerable monuments of truth to
      make known to me if the holy pontiff, who presides here, is the true
      successor of St. Peter, vicar of Christ, and the infallible doctor of the
      church. I find in the apostolic days no question of a pope, successor to
      St. Peter, the vicar of Jesus Christ, any more than a Mohammed who did not
      then exist. Now having read the whole New Testament, I declare before God,
      with my hand raised to that great crucifix, that I have found no trace of
      the papacy as it exists at this moment.”
    </p>
    <p>And in concluding his speech he said:</p>
    <p>
      “I have established: (1) that Jesus gave to His apostles the same power
      that He gave to St. Peter. (2) That apostles never recognized in St. Peter
      the vicar of Jesus Christ. (3) That Peter never thought of being pope, and
      never acted as if he were a pope. (4) That the councils of the first four
      centuries, while they recognized the high position which the bishop of
      Rome occupied on account of Rome, only accorded to him the preeminence of
      honor, never of power or jurisdiction. (5) That the holy fathers in the
      famous passage, ‘Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my
      church,’ never understood that the church was built on Peter (super Petrum
      ) but on the rock (super petram). That is, on the confession of the faith
      of the apostle. I conclude victoriously, with history, with reason, with
      logic, with good sense, and with a Christian conscience, that Jesus Christ
      did not confer any supremacy on St. Peter, and that the bishops of Rome
      did not become sovereigns of the church, but only by confiscating one by
      one all the rights of the episcopate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishops from the United States and Canada had very special reasons for
      disliking the infallibility decree. Lord Acton, of England, a Roman
      Catholic historian and editor whose scholarship cannot be questioned,
      recognized the peculiar circumstances under which this decree placed the
      American bishops and wrote in their defense:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Americans ask how they are to live under the free constitutions of
      the Republic, and maintain their position of equality with their fellow
      citizens, after committing themselves to the principles attested by papal
      infallibility, such as: (1) Religious persecution and the coercive power
      of the church. (2) The claim of Catholicism to exclusive mastery in the
      state. (3) The pope’s right to dispense from oaths. And (4) The subjection
      of the civil power to his supreme dominion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion was abruptly closed before all the opponents had been
      heard. When the vote was to be taken practically all of those who were
      opposed to the decree absented themselves, since they did not want to be
      officially on record against it. Five hundred thirty-three delegates
      answered in the affirmative, two answered in the negative, and 106 were
      absent. And well might any delegate hesitate before voting against the
      decree, for to it would be attached the anathema: “If any one—which may
      God forbid!—shall presume to contradict this our definition, let him be
      anathema.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The decree having been passed, all the bishops were required to give their
      consent. MacGregor writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some of the recalcitrant bishops were exceedingly dilatory in sending in
      their submission. But they did, and the papalists have ever since made a
      great deal of this fact. The alternative to submission was
      excommunication. This extreme penalty is terrible for a devout layman,
      since it deprives him of the sacraments, the greatest solace in a Catholic
      life. It is even worse for a priest for it cuts him off absolutely from
      every friend he is likely to have, not to mention his livelihood, making
      him at worst an object of contempt, at best an object of pity. But for a
      bishop excommunication is a sentence almost past endurance. Even the most
      heroic could hardly be expected to face it” (The Vatican Revolution, p.
      63).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Roman Church, having no sure Scriptural anchorage concerning the
      problem of authority, drifted about for centuries before solving this
      problem. As we have indicated, some of the strongest opposition to the
      infallibility decree came from within the Roman Church. The leading German
      theologian, Dollinger, who had been a teacher of theology for 47 years,
      strenuously opposed the decree, and insisted that the three leading
      criteria in all such controversies—universality, antiquity, and
      consent—were clearly lacking. He could not be induced to change his mind,
      and was excommunicated on April 17, 1871. A further result of the decree
      was that a small group of anti-infallibilists met in Munich, Germany, in
      September, 1871, withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church, and formed the
      “Old Catholic” Church, which, although not as well known as it should be,
      continues to this day and serves as a salutary and inconvenient reminder
      of the outrage perpetrated against the leading German theologian of the
      Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      By its vote the Council in effect abdicated its power and acknowledged
      that there was nothing that any future council could do that could not be
      done as well or better by the pope himself. Since the pope is acknowledged
      to have the guidance of the Holy Spirit and therefore to possess every
      power that a council could have, he has no particular need to call a
      council. This was clearly foreseen by Dollinger who, in a monumental work,
      Papal Infallibility (1871) wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Councils will for the future be superfluous: the bishops will no doubt be
      assembled in Rome now and then to swell the pomp of a papal canonization
      or some other grand ceremony, but they will have nothing to do with the
      dogma. If they wish to confirm a papal decision... this would be bringing
      lanterns to aid the light of the noon-day sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the bishops know the view and will of the pope on any question, it
      would be presumptuous and idle to vote against it. An ecumenical assembly
      of the church can have no existence, properly speaking, in the presence of
      an ‘ordinarius ordinariorum’ and infallible teacher of faith, though, of
      course, the pomp, ceremonial, speeches, and voting of a council may be
      displayed to the gaze of the world. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bishops who have been obliged to swear ‘to maintain, defend, increase,
      and advance the rights, honors, privileges, and authority of their Lord
      the Pope—and every bishop takes this oath—cannot regard themselves, or be
      regarded by the Christian world, as free members of a free council.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical effect of the infallibility decree has been to stifle the
      development of theological doctrine within the Roman Church. For only the
      pope can speak with authority, and when he speaks there can be no
      opposition. No longer can a church council or a theologian appeal to the
      Scriptures as against the pope. Paul says: “The word of God is not bound”
      (2 Timothy 2:9). But by this decree the Word of God is frozen and chained
      down by a well-nigh unbreakable chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to notice that in the early Christian and later Roman
      Catholic Church history there have been but twenty-one ecumenical
      councils, the latest having been the Second Vatican Council, which was
      called by Pope John XXIII, and which began its sessions in Rome, in
      October, 1962. It would seem, however, that such a council can be little
      more than a puppet gathering, since any action that it may take can become
      effective only after that action has been approved by the pope. It is safe
      to say that nothing will be done contrary to the pope’s wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacGregor calls the infallibility decree “the most momentous decision in
      the history of the Roman Church” (p. 3). He says that it “sounded the
      death knell to the democratic element in the Roman Catholic tradition”;
      and adds that, “So absolute is the papal authority that not even the
      entire church may dare to review or modify the pope’s judgment in tiny
      way. If the whole of the rest of the church should disagree with the pope,
      the whole of the rest of the church would be in error” (p. 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Vatican Council does mark a turning point in the history of the
      Roman Church is clear. For centuries the popes avoided church councils
      like the plague, because they regarded them as rivals to their own
      authority. But the Vatican Council changed all of that by making absolute
      the pope’s power and thus making all councils practically superfluous. The
      papacy today tolerates no criticism from its own people. There was a time
      in the early history of the church when priests, monks, and even the laity
      could express their criticisms of the church and be heard. But that has
      all disappeared and today the Roman Church is a total dictatorship with an
      infallible pope at its head. Says Dr. Walter M. Montano, editor of
      Christian Heritage , “All voices are silenced; protests are crushed;
      dissenters are excommunicated. A total dictatorship—in spirit and
      letter—rules every aspect of the Roman Catholic Church” (booklet, Can a
      True Catholic Be a Loyal American?, p. 14).

  <section>
    <h2>Errors of the Popes</h2>
    <p>
      It is difficult to say whether a claim such as that of infallibility is
      more wicked or ridiculous. It certainly is wicked, because it gives to a
      man one of the attributes of God and usurps the headship of Christ in the
      church. And it is ridiculous, because the history of the popes reveals
      many grievous errors, moral and doctrinal, with one often denying what
      another has affirmed. The claim to infallibility is so fantastic that it
      is hard to take seriously since the “infallible” church and the
      “infallible” popes have made so many mistakes. Many of their solemnly
      worded decrees are contradictory to the Word of God. And much of the
      prestige and temporal power of the Roman Church was gained through the use
      of forgeries such as the alleged “gift of Constantine,” or the Isadorian
      decretals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the popes have taught heretical doctrines. Some have been grossly
      immoral, although the theologians say that this does not affect their
      official powers. Several have been condemned by later popes and church
      councils, and some have been declared “antipopes,” that is, fraudulently
      chosen or elected, and later dropped from the official record. Among popes
      committing serious errors are the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Callistus (bishop of Rome, 221-227) is said by Hippolytus, a third century
      writer, to have been a kind of Unitarian, identifying the Father and the
      Son as one indivisible Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberius, in 358, subscribed to a heretical Arian creed in order to gain
      the bishopric of Rome under the heretical emperor Constantius. He broke
      with and anathematized Athanasius, the great trinitarian defender of the
      Nicene Creed, who records him as an opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zozimus (417-418) pronounced Pelagius an orthodox teacher, but later
      reversed his position at the insistence of Augustine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vigilinus (538-555) refused to condemn certain heretical teachers at the
      time of the monophysite controversy, and boycotted the fifth Ecumenical
      Council which met at Constantinople in 553. When the Council proceeded
      without him and threatened to excommunicate and anathematize him, he
      submitted to its opinions, confessing that he had been a tool of Satan
      (cf. Hefele, one of the best known Roman Catholic writers, History of the
      Christian Councils , Vol. IV, p. 345).
    </p>
    <p>
      Honorius (625-638). The heresy of Honorius was clearly official. Dr.
      Harris has treated this case quite fully in the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The greatest scandal of this nature is pope Honorius. He specifically
      taught the Monothelite heresy in two letters to the patriarch of
      Constantinople [that is that Christ had only one will, which by
      implication meant that he denied either His deity or His humanity]. The
      opinion was condemned by the sixth ecumenical council (680) which
      condemned and excommunicated Honorius by name ( Honorio haeretico
      anathema, Session XVI). The Roman breviary contained this anathema until
      the sixteenth century (until the time of Luther, when apparently the
      Reformers made so much of it that it was quietly dropped). ... Honorius
      was a heretic according to Roman Catholic standards and was condemned by
      church councils and popes for 800 years. Such facts are not known to most
      Protestants as they arise from the technical study of history. They
      naturally are not publicized by Roman Catholics. But facts they are. And
      they entirely disprove the papal claims” ( Fundamental Protestant
      Doctrines, II, p. 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      This condemnation of Honorius as a heretic shows clearly that the bishops
      of that time had no idea whatever of papal infallibility. For how can a
      pope be infallible and at the same time be condemned as a heretic? Also
      let it be noticed that Honorius held the papal chair for thirteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory I (590-604) called anyone who would take the title of Universal
      Bishop an antichrist, but Boniface III (607) compelled the emperor Phocas
      to confer that title upon him, and it has been used by all later popes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadrian II (867-872) declared civil marriages to be valid, but Pius VII
      (1800-1823) condemned them as invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious case arises in regard to Hadrian IV (1154-1159), who authorized
      the invasion and subjugation of Ireland by the British king Henry II. That
      conquest marks the beginning of British rule in Ireland, a thing which has
      been bitterly resented by the Irish. It is of more than passing interest
      to note that Hadrian was an English pope, the only Englishman ever to hold
      that position. But that should make no difference. A pope is a pope
      regardless of nationality or race. In view of the attitude of later Roman
      Catholics toward British rule in Ireland, they evidently will have to say
      that in sanctioning the invasion the pope’s decree did not relate to
      morals. Or perhaps the problem is to be solved by saying that when the
      pope authorized that much to be regretted invasion, he was not seated on
      the papal chair, but was perhaps at the table, or perhaps reclining on a
      sofa! Indeed, if at the moment he did not happen to be seated on the papal
      chair, we may have to forget the whole matter. For by such means the Roman
      Church to escape from its embarrassing position as regards this invasion
      of Ireland, and to hold that there was no infallible mistake after all.
      But it will hardly do to say that the pope was not speaking ex cathedra.
      For if he has that great power but fails to use it in such momentous
      decisions, or uses it carelessly, he surely is culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can one infallible pope, Eugene IV (1431-1447), condemn Joan of Arc
      (1412-1431) to be burned alive as a witch, while another pope, Benedict
      XV, in 1919, declares her to be a saint?
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been some dispute in the Roman Church concerning which version
      of the Vulgate should be used. Pope Sixtus V (1585-1590) preferred the old
      version, personally supervised every sheet of an edition then being
      published, and prefixed an editorial bull to the first volume
      excommunicating anyone who in republishing the work should make any
      alterations in the text. But it turned out that the work contained so many
      errors that it had to be recalled, and another infallible pope published
      another version, altered in many particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condemnation of Galileo for his theory that the earth moves around the
      sun is a special case in point. Dr. Zacchello has stated this well:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Were popes Paul V (1605-1621) and Urban VIII (1623-1644) infallible when
      they condemned Galileo for holding a true scientific theory? Did they not
      declare the Copemican theory was false, heretical, and contrary to the
      word of God? Did they not torture and imprison Galileo in the dungeons of
      the Inquisition for not sharing their erroneous views? In their decree
      prohibiting the book of Copernicus, De Revolutionibus, the congregation of
      the index, March 5, 1619, denounced the new system of the mobility of the
      earth and the immobility of the sun as ‘utterly contrary to the Holy
      Scriptures’” (Ins and Outs of Romanism, p. 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      How is the decree of Clement XIV (July 21, 1773) suppressing the Jesuits
      to be harmonized with the contrary decree of Pius VII (August 7, 1814)
      restoring them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixtus V (1585-1590) recommended the reading of the Bible, but Pius VII
      (1800-1823) and various other popes condemned that practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards infallibility in the moral sphere, consider these cases. Pope
      John XI (931-936) was the illegitimate son of Pope Sergius III by a wicked
      woman named Marozia. The nephew of John XI, who took the name John XII
      (956-964), was raised to the papacy at the age of 18 through the political
      intrigue of the Tuscan party which was then dominant in Rome, and proved
      to be a thoroughly immoral man. His tyrannies and debaucheries were such
      that, upon complaint of the People of Rome, the emperor Otho tried and
      deposed him. Some of the sins enumerated in the charge were murder,
      perjury, sacrilege, adultery, and incest. Yet he is reckoned as a
      legitimate pope through whom the unbroken chain of apostolic authority
      descends from Peter to the pope of the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander VI (1492-1503) was one of the Borgia popes, from Spain, and had
      been made a cardinal at the age of 25. He had six illegitimate children,
      two of whom were bom after he became pope. The charge of adultery was
      brought against him repeatedly. His third son, Caesar Borgia, was made a
      cardinal and was appointed to command the papal armies. The intrigues and
      immoralities of his daughter Lucretia Borgia, brought a full measure of
      disgrace upon the papal office. The Roman Catholic historian, Ludwig
      Pastor, in his History of the Popes, grants that he lived the immoral life
      of the secular princes of his day, both as cardinal and as pope (V, 363;
      VI, 140); that he obtained the papacy by the rankest simony (V, 385); and
      that he brought that office into disrepute by his unconcealed nepotism and
      lack of moral sense (VI, 139). The eloquent reformer Savonarola urged his
      deposition, whereupon Alexander had him condemned as a heretic, hanged,
      and publicly burned in 1498.
    </p>
    <p>
      John XXIII (1410-1415) was deposed by the Council of Constance because of
      simony and immorality, and the Roman Church now attempts to deny that he
      ever was a legitimate pope. Apparently the recent John XXIII will have to
      be known as Pope John XXIII, the Second. During the period of history
      known as the Middle Ages many of the popes were guilty of nearly every
      crime in the catalogue of sin. Twenty-nine of those who held the office at
      one time or another, but who are now said to have obtained it by fraud or
      otherwise to have been unfit for it, are now listed as “anti-popes.”
      Repeatedly the papal office was bought and sold by cardinals and popes as
      unworthy men sought to gain control. These abuses, together with many
      others, are described with surprising frankness and detail in a recent
      book, The Papal Princes, by a Roman Catholic, Glenn D. Kittler, with the
      Nihil Obstat of Daniel D. Flynn, S.T.D., Censor librorum, and the
      Imprimatur of Cardinal Spellman (1960; 358 pages; Funk & Wagnalls, New
      York).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1939 Pope Pius XII was inaugurated as the 262 nd pope. But in 1947
      Vatican scholars revised the official list of popes, dropped some, added
      some, questioned others, and reduced the number to 261. St. Anacletus, who
      was supposed to have reigned about the year 100, was eliminated when
      research showed that he and St. Cletus, who reigned about the year 76,
      were the same person. Donus II (973) was dropped when research showed that
      he never existed. Alexander V and John XXIII, fifteenth century figures,
      were relegated to the list of anti-popes, or false claimants. The reign of
      John XIV (984) was once divided into two, erroneously adding a
      non-existent John to the series. In 1958 Pope John XXIII was inaugurated
      as the 262 nd pope. But in 1961 still another pope was deposed, Stephen II
      (752). With the inauguration of Paul VI in 1963 he was accounted by some
      to be the 262 nd pope, although the 1963 Pontifical Yearbook has abandoned
      for the present any attempt to number the popes, giving as its reason the
      impossibility of determining the validity of some of the names. Quite a
      record we would say for a church boasting infallibility, whether that
      infallibility be vested in its councils or in its popes!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have called attention to the numerous false doctrines set forth by Pope
      Pius IX in his Syllabus of Errors (1864). We single out just one for
      special mention as completely contrary to our American ideals of civil and
      ecclesiastical relations, namely, that which declares that the church and
      the state should be united, with the church in the dominant position. In
      fact he went so far as to declare that the separation of church and state
      is one of the principal errors of our age. Recently, however, the Knights
      of Columbus have circulated a pamphlet in which they declare that the pope
      in condemning the separation of church and state did not have in mind the
      kind of separation that exists in the United States. But the Syllabus made
      no exception for the United States. It was an unqualified assertion of the
      basic principles that should govern the church and the state everywhere in
      the world. The United States has the same form of government today that it
      had in 1864. Hence the Knights of Columbus are quite clearly resorting to
      subterfuge, and are simply attempting to shield the Roman Church from
      responsibility concerning one of its official doctrines which is
      diametrically opposed to our American form of government. The almost
      universal feeling today, even among enlightened Roman Catholics, is that
      the issuance of the Syllabus of Errors was in itself a serious error.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet despite these cases of error and many others that could be cited,
      the infallibility decree, which was retroactive and therefore applies to
      all earlier as well as later popes, officially pronounces all of the popes
      infallible as teachers of faith and morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should point out that there have been several popes who expressly
      disclaimed the attribute of infallibility (we may even say, the divine
      attribute of infallibility, for only God is infallible as regards faith
      and morals), most conspicuous of whom have been Vigilius, Innocent III,
      Clement IV, Gregory XI, Hadrian VI, and Paul IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Rome’s claim to infallibility is contradicted by Scripture, logic,
      and history. Dr. Harris writes appropriately:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact is, the popes are not infallible. They preach and teach another
      gospel. They not only contradict themselves, but contradict the Bible as
      well. All the fanfare of wealth, the tinsel of ceremony, and the prestige
      of power which we witness at Rome cannot avail before God. The present
      pope John XXIII is neither infallible nor orthodox nor the successor of
      Peter, nor of any other of the holy apostles of Jesus Christ. He is an
      imposter as was the first John XXIII of the fifteenth century.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have indicated, this alleged attribute of infallibility has been
      used only very sparingly by the popes, evidently because they do not want
      to risk being caught up by false statements. Apparently it has been
      formally invoked on only three occasions—twice by Pope Pius IX, once when
      he proclaimed his own infallibility, and once when, without benefit of a
      church council, he set forth the doctrine of the immaculate conception of
      the Virgin Mary; and once by Pope Pius XII, when he promulgated the
      doctrine of the assumption of the Virgin Mary. And, we would say, in each
      instance the pope employing it set forth colossal error. Indeed the pope
      must be quite a practical joker if, possessing such power, he so seldom
      gives any indication that he is using it, but keeps the people guessing
      whether or not he is speaking authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably no other element of the papal system causes the Romanists more
      embarrassment than this doctrine of papal infallibility. In the first
      place it asserts a doctrine that can be easily disproved, and in the
      second place it serves to focus attention on the utter unreasonableness of
      the powers claimed by and for the pope. To Protestants the whole ex
      cathedra business appears on the one hand, as particularly monstrous and
      vicious, and on the other, as just a big joke—a joke perpetrated on the
      Roman Catholic people who are so docile and unthinking and so poorly
      informed as to believe in and submit to such sophistry.
