    <h2>What Tradition Is</h2>
    <p>
      Protestantism and Roman Catholicism agree that the Bible is the inspired
      Word of God. But they differ widely in regard to the place that it is to
      have in the life of the church. Protestantism holds that the Bible alone
      is the authoritative and sufficient rule of faith and practice. But
      Romanism holds that the Bible must be supplemented by a great body of
      tradition consisting of 14 or 15 apocryphal books or portions of books
      equivalent to about two thirds the volume of the New Testament, the
      voluminous writings of the Greek and Latin church fathers, and a huge
      collection of church council pronouncements and papal decrees as of equal
      value and authority—a veritable library in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very evident that this difference of opinion concerning the
      authoritative basis of the church is bound to have radical and
      far-reaching effects. The age-long controversy between Protestantism and
      Roman Catholicism comes to a head regarding the question of authority.
      Right here, we believe, is the basic difference between Protestantism and
      Roman Catholicism. And, we may add, we believe that in its use of
      tradition is to be found the Achilles’ heel of Roman Catholicism. For it
      is in this that Romanism finds the authority for its distinctive
      doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every religious movement that develops some unity, and continues to live,
      has its traditions. These traditions gather up the beliefs, thinking,
      practices, and rules of the group, particularly as these are expressed in
      its doctrinal standards and forms of government. In this manner the
      movement gives stability to and regulates its own manner of life, and
      hands that stability and manner of life on to the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not reject all tradition, but rather make judicious use of it
      insofar as it accords with Scripture and is founded on truth. We should,
      for instance, treat with respect and study with care the confessions and
      council pronouncements of the various churches, particularly those of the
      ancient church and of Reformation days. We should also give careful
      attention to the confessions and council decisions of the present day
      churches, scrutinizing most carefully of course those of the denomination
      to which we belong. But we do not give any church the right to formulate
      new doctrine or to make decisions contrary to the teaching of Scripture.
      The history of the church at large shows all too clearly that church
      leaders and church councils can and do make mistakes, some of them
      serious. Consequently their decisions should have no authority except as
      they are based on Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestants differ from Roman Catholics in that they keep these standards
      strictly subordinate to Scripture, and in that they are ever ready to
      re-examine them for that purpose. In other words they insist that, in the
      life of the church, Scripture is primary, and the denominational standards
      are subordinate or secondary. They thus use their traditions with one
      controlling caution—they continually ask if this or that aspect of their
      belief and practice is true to the Bible. They subject every statement of
      tradition to that test, and they are willing to change any element that
      fails to meet that test.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast with this, Roman Catholics hold that there are two sources of
      authority— Scripture, and developing tradition, with the church being the
      judge of Scripture and therefore able to say authoritatively what the
      right interpretation of Scripture is. This, in effect, gives three
      authorities—the Bible, tradition, and the church. The primacy is in the
      hands of the church since it controls both tradition and the
      interpretation of Scripture. This, therefore, is the basis on which the
      Roman system rests. If this can be shown to be erroneous, it will be seen
      that the whole system rests on a false basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Roman Catholicism works out in actual practice, the traditions of the
      church at any time are what the church says they are, Scripture means what
      the church says it means, and the people are permitted to read the Bible
      only in an approved version and within the limits of a predetermined
      interpretation. But when the Christian message is thus shackled by
      tradition and ecclesiastically dictated interpretation, it ceases to be
      the free grace of God offered to repentant sinners, and becomes an
      instrument in the hands of the clergy for the control of the people. In
      professing to interpret the Bible in the light of tradition, the Roman
      Church in reality places tradition above the Bible, so that the Roman
      Catholic is governed, not by the Bible, nor by the Bible and tradition,
      but by the church itself, which sets up the tradition and says what it
      means. Theoretically, the Roman Church accepts the Bible, but in practice
      she does not leave her members free to follow it. The errors that are
      found in her traditions obscure and nullify much of the truth that she
      professes to hold. To cite but one example of what this means in actual
      practice, while the Roman Catholic Church, in professing allegiance to the
      Bible, must agree with the Protestant churches that there is “one mediator
      also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2.5), she
      introduces a host of other mediators—the Virgin Mary, the priests, and
      hundreds of saints and angels—which effectively sets aside the truth
      contained in the Scripture statement.

    <h2>How Tradition Nullifies the Word of God</h2>
    <p>
      We give credit to Rome for this: she professes to hold that the Bible is
      the Word of God. She repudiates and denounces modernism, which in reality
      is a more or less consistent denial of the supernatural throughout the
      Christian system and which unfortunately has come to have a strong
      influence in some Protestant churches. Modernists seek to reduce some of
      the historical accounts of the Bible, as for example those of the creation
      of man and of the fall, to mere myths or legends. Also, modernists usually
      say that the Bible contains the Word of God, but deny that it is in all
      its parts actually the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having said that, we must point out how Rome also nullifies or
      destroys the Word. She maintains that alongside of the written Word there
      is also an unwritten Word, an oral tradition, which was taught by Christ
      and the apostles but which is not in the Bible, which rather was handed
      down generation after generation by word of mouth. This unwritten Word of
      God, it is said, comes to expression in the pronouncements of the church
      councils and in papal decrees. It takes precedence over the written Word
      and interprets it. The pope, as God’s personal representative on the
      earth, can legislate for things additional to the Bible as new situations
      arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent, the most authoritative of all Roman councils and the
      one of greatest historical importance, in the year 1546, declared that the
      Word of God is contained both in the Bible and in tradition, that the two
      are of equal authority, and that it is the duty of every Christian to
      accord them equal veneration and respect. Thus, while modernism takes away
      from the Word of God, Romanism adds to it. Both are in error, and each
      would seem to be about equally bad. It would be hard to say which has done
      more to undermine true religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The untrustworthiness of oral tradition, however, is apparent for several
      reasons. In the first place, the early Christians, who were closest to
      Christ and the apostles, and whose testimony therefore would have been
      most valuable, wrote but very little because of the persecutions to which
      they were exposed. And what is found in the writings of the second and
      third centuries has but little reference to the doctrines which at present
      are in dispute between Protestants and Roman Catholics. Tradition,
      therefore, for hundreds of years allegedly was transmitted by mere report.
      And it is this which Rome receives as of equal authority with the written
      Word. But so unreliable is report that it has become a proverb that “a
      story never loses in its carriage.” In other words, a story seldom retains
      its original character without addition and exaggeration. Fortunately, we
      have a remarkable instance in the New Testament itself in which report or
      tradition circulated a falsehood, showing how easily oral tradition can
      become corrupted, how in a particular instance it did become corrupted
      even in the apostolic age. In John 21:21-23 we read: “Peter therefore
      seeing him (John) saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus
      saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
      follow thou me. This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that
      that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should
      not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?”
      Surely we cannot build a church on such an insecure foundation as oral
      tradition!
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, that the body of tradition is not of divine origin nor
      apostolic is proved by the fact that some traditions contradict others.
      The church fathers repeatedly contradict one another. When a Roman
      Catholic priest is ordained, he solemnly vows to interpret the Scriptures
      only according to “the unanimous consent of the fathers.” But such
      “unanimous consent” is purely a myth. The fact is they scarcely agree on
      any doctrine. They contradict each other, and even contradict themselves
      as they change their minds and affirm what they previously had denied.
      Augustine, the greatest of the fathers, in his later life wrote a special
      book in which he set forth his Retractions. Some of the fathers of the
      second century held that Christ would return shortly and that He would
      reign personally in Jerusalem for a thousand years. But two of the best
      known scholars of the early church, Origen (185-254), and Augustine
      (354-430), wrote against that view. The early fathers condemned the use of
      images in worship, while later ones approved such use. The early fathers
      almost unanimously advocated the reading and free use of the Scriptures,
      while the later ones restricted such reading and use. Gregory the Great,
      bishop of Rome and the greatest of the early bishops, denounced the
      assumption of the title of Universal Bishop as anti-Christian. But later
      popes even to the present day have been very insistent on using that and
      similar titles which assert universal authority. Where, then, is the
      universal tradition and unanimous consent of the fathers to papal
      doctrine?
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who wrote the books of the Bible were inspired by the Holy Spirit
      and so were preserved from error. But the traditions of the church
      fathers, the church councils, and the popes are of a lower order and
      contain many errors and contradictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellarmine (1542-1621), a Jesuit and a noted Roman Catholic writer,
      divides tradition into three classes—divine, apostolic, and
      ecclesiastical. Divine traditions are those which it is alleged Christ
      Himself taught or ordained, which were not written but were handed down
      generation after generation by word of mouth. Apostolic traditions are
      those which were taught by the apostles but not written. And
      ecclesiastical traditions are those council pronouncements and papal
      decrees which have accumulated through the centuries. We insist, however,
      that it would have been utterly impossible for those traditions to have
      been handed down with accuracy generation after generation by word of
      mouth and in an atmosphere dark with superstition and immorality such as
      characterized the entire church, laity and priesthood alike, through long
      periods of its history. And we assert that there is no proof whatever that
      they were so transmitted. Clearly the bulk of those traditions originated
      with the monks during the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the leaders of the Reformation appealed to Scripture and thundered
      against the errors of the Roman Church, that church had to defend herself.
      And since she could not do so from the Bible alone, she resorted to these
      other writings. The result is that the most prominent doctrines and
      practices of the Roman Church, such as purgatory, the priesthood, the
      mass, transubstantiation, prayers for the dead, indulgences, penance,
      worship of the Virgin Mary, the use of images in worship, holy water,
      rosary beads, celibacy of priests and nuns, the papacy itself, and
      numerous others, are founded solely on tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is on such a basis as this that the Roman Church seeks to establish
      herself as “the only true church.” But when the Roman Catholic layman
      searches his Bible for confirmation of the distinctive doctrines of his
      church, he finds either absolute silence or a distinct negative. The
      Bible, for instance, has nothing to say about the pope or the papacy as an
      institution, and it is emphatic and uncompromising in its commands against
      the use of images or idols in worship. It is natural that the Roman Church
      does not want to give up tradition. It cannot. If it were to give up
      tradition the whole system would fall to the ground, so much of its
      doctrine and practice has no other foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, the Roman Church does not claim that the pope receives new
      revelations or that he is inspired by the Holy Spirit as were the prophets
      and apostles when they wrote Scripture. In fact it denies that it
      formulates any new doctrines at all. Rather it insists that in ex cathedra
      pronouncements the Holy Spirit enables the pope to draw out and proclaim
      what belonged to the original revelation. But it does claim a divine
      presence of the Holy Spirit in the giving of ex cathedra pronouncements
      and in the formulation of traditions— which we would say is precisely the
      same in principle as claiming inspiration. At any rate, by this device it
      professes to maintain the unchangeability of the church while in reality
      it adds new doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious how inaccessible the Roman rule of faith is. No priest has
      the rule of his faith, which he vows to accept at ordination, unless he
      has all these numerous and ponderous volumes. No one could possibly master
      such a mass of materials, even if they contained no contradictions. And
      such a rule of faith is utterly beyond the reach of the laity.

<div id="Apocrypha" dropdownName="The Apocrypha" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Apocrypha</h2>
    <p>
      The 14 or 15 books that the Roman Catholic Church adds to the Bible and
      pronounces equally inspired and authoritative are known as the Apocrypha.
      These are printed as a part of the Bible and must be accepted by all Roman
      Catholics as genuine under penalty of mortal sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word Apocrypha is from the Greek apokrupha , meaning hidden things,
      and is used by ecclesiastical writers for matters which are (1) secret or
      mysterious; or (2) unknown in origin, forged, or spurious; or (3)
      unrecognized or uncanonical. It is primarily in the sense of spurious or
      uncanonical that we use the term. The books had this name before they were
      officially approved by the Council of Trent, and so it is not a name given
      them by Protestants. They are listed as follows:
    </p>
    <p>1. The First Book of Esdras</p>
    <p>2. The Second Book of Esdras</p>
    <p>3. Tobit</p>
    <p>4. Judith</p>
    <p>5. The additions to the book of Esther</p>
    <p>6. The Wisdom of Solomon</p>
    <p>7. Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach</p>
    <p>8. Baruch</p>
    <p>9. The Letter of Jeremiah</p>
    <p>10. The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men</p>
    <p>11. Susanna</p>
    <p>12. Bell and the Dragon</p>
    <p>13. The Prayer of Manasseh</p>
    <p>14. The First Book of Maccabees</p>
    <p>15. The Second Book of Maccabees</p>
    <p>
      Of these only the First and Second Books of Esdras (the latter of which
      contains an emphatic denial of the value of prayers for the dead, 7:105),
      and The Prayer of Azariah, were not officially accepted at the Council of
      Trent. The books accepted add a volume of literature abut two thirds the
      size of the New Testament, or if the entire 15 be included, about 84
      percent of the size of the New Testament. By way of comparison, a word
      count of the Old Testament in the King James Version shows a total of
      592,439 words, the New Testament 181,253 words, and the Apocrypha 152,185
      words. And since the Apocryphal books are pre-Christian, having been
      written between the close of the Old Testament and the coming of Christ,
      the effect of such an addition is to give greater prominence to the Old
      Testament and therefore to Jewish life and thought, and to decrease
      relatively the importance of the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew Old Testament was completed some four hundred years before the
      time of Christ. In the second century B.C., a Greek translation by Hebrew
      scholars was made in Alexandria, Egypt, and was called the Septuagint
      because the translators numbered 70. There developed an important
      difference, however, between the Greek translation and the Hebrew canon
      since the Septuagint contained a dozen or more Apocryphal books
      interspersed among the books of the Hebrew Bible. But not all copies
      contained the same books—suggesting that there was no general agreement
      among the translators as to which of these additional books were
      authoritative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Septuagint translation came into general use in Palestine, and that
      was the popular version at the time of Christ. But the Palestinian Jews
      never accepted the Apocryphal additions. And Protestants accept only the
      39 books of the Old Testament that were in the Hebrew Bible at the time of
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no record that Christ or any of the apostles ever quoted from the
      Apocryphal books or that they made any reference to them, although they
      undoubtedly knew of them. There are in the New Testament about 290 direct
      quotations from and about 370 allusions to passages in the Old Testament;
      yet among all of those there is not a single reference either by Christ or
      any of the apostles to the Apocryphal writings. They quote from every
      major book of the Old Testament and from all but four of the smaller ones.
      They thus set their stamp of approval upon the Jewish Old Testament.
      Christ quoted it as authoritative, and said, “The Scriptures cannot be
      broken” (John 10:35). But the reason that neither He nor the apostles ever
      once referred to the Apocryphal books is obvious. They did not regard
      those books as Scripture, and they did not intend that legendary books
      should become a part of the Bible. Romanists sometimes charge Protestants
      with having “cut those books out of the Bible.” But the record makes it
      clear that if anyone cut them out, it was Christ Himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all the more significant when we remember that the language
      commonly spoken in Palestine in the days of Christ was not Hebrew, but
      Aramaic, that Greek was one of the spoken languages of Palestine at that
      time, that bilingual Christians who spoke both Aramaic and Greek probably
      were in the church from the first, and that Christ Himself probably could
      speak Greek as well as Aramaic. Furthermore, the New Testament books were
      written in Greek, and in those books we find that while some of the
      quotations were from the Old Testament reflecting the direct use of the
      Hebrew, the prevailing practice was to quote from the Greek of the
      Septuagint. Hence the writers undoubtedly were familiar with the
      Apocryphal books and undoubtedly would have made some quotations from them
      if they had been regarded as Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we find that at the time of Christ there were two versions of the Old
      Testament current in Palestine, the more liberal Alexandrian Septuagint,
      including the Apocryphal books, in Greek, and the more conservative Hebrew
      version which included only the canonical books of the Jews, and that the
      Roman Catholic Bible follows the Alexandrian while the Protestant Bible
      follows the Hebrew version.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loose talk of some Roman Catholic writers about the “Greek Bible,” the
      form of the Septuagint that originated in Alexandria, Egypt, being the
      Bible of the early church, is no credit to scholarship for it ignores the
      most important point of all, namely, that so far as the evidence goes,
      Jesus and the New Testament writers did not consider the Apocryphal books
      canonical but instead accepted the Palestinian version of the Old
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Josephus, the noted Jewish historian, about A.D. 90, gave a
      list of the books of the Jewish law and prophets, but he did not include
      the Apocryphal books. Other Jewish sources support Josephus. The Apocrypha
      was rejected by Origen, who is generally acknowledged to have been the
      most learned man in the church before Augustine, by Tertullian, an
      outstanding scholar in the early third century, by Athanasius, the
      champion of orthodoxy at the Council of Nicaea and by Jerome, the
      translator of the Latin Vulgate which became the authorized Roman Catholic
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome declared emphatically that the Apocrypha was no part of the Old
      Testament Scriptures. However, against his wishes and his better judgment,
      he allowed himself to be persuaded by two of his bishop friends who
      admired the books of Tobit and Judith to make a hurried translation of
      those. He is said to have translated the former at one sitting, and
      neither of them received the careful attention that had been given to the
      books which he considered canonical. But it is unfortunate that he did
      make the translations, for they were later bound up with his Vulgate, and
      served to encourage the addition of other Apocryphal books. Augustine
      alone of the prominent scholars in the early church was willing to give
      the Apocrypha a place in the Bible, but it is not certain that he
      considered it authoritative in all cases. Yet in spite of all of these
      things, the 53 bishops of the Council of Trent, in the year 1546,
      pronounced the Apocryphal books canonical and deserving “equal veneration”
      with the books of the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even within the Roman Church, opinion regarding the canonicity of the
      Apocrypha has been divided. We have pointed out that Jerome categorically
      denied that it formed any part of the inspired Scriptures. Cardinal
      Cajetan, Luther’s opponent at Augsburg in 1518, in his Commentary on all
      the Authentic Historical Books of the Old Testament, which he dedicated in
      1532 to pope Clement VII, approved the Hebrew canon as over against the
      Alexandrian. And within the Council of Trent itself several of its members
      were opposed to the inclusion of these books in the Bible. Thus, even
      within the papacy, the Apocrypha was not considered canonical until the
      Council of Trent added it to the Old Testament and pronounced it so—nearly
      2,000 years after the Old Testament was completed and closed.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Harris writing on this subject says:</p>
    <p>
      “Pope Gregory the Great declared that First Maccabees, an Apocryphal book,
      is not canonical. Cardinal Zomenes, in his Polyglot Bible just before the
      Council of Trent, excluded the Apocrypha and his work was approved by pope
      Leo X. Could these popes have been mistaken or not? If they were correct,
      the decision of the Council of Trent was wrong. If they were wrong where
      is a pope’s infallibility as a teacher of doctrine?” (.Fundamental
      Protestant Doctrines, I, p. 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The real reason for the addition of the Apocryphal books to the Bible by
      the Roman Church, as we have said, is to be found in connection with
      events at the time of the Reformation. The Reformers vigorously attacked
      doctrines which they regarded as unscriptural. The doctrine of purgatory
      in particular was in need of defense, and the Roman scholars thought they
      found support in 2 Maccabees 12:40-45, which tells of the work of Judas
      Maccabeus, who after a battle sent money to Jerusalem to offer a sacrifice
      for soldiers who had died while guilty of the sin of idolatry. But, as we
      shall show when we discuss the doctrine of purgatory, this passage really
      does not support the Roman Catholic position at all. For idolatry is a
      mortal sin, and according to Roman Catholic doctrine, those dying in
      mortal sin go directly to hell. Only those who are guilty of venial sin go
      to purgatory and so only they can be helped by masses and prayers. This
      again illustrates the desperate nature of the search for support of the
      distinctive Roman Catholic doctrines.

    <h2>The Nature of the Apocryphal Books</h2>
    <p>
      What, then, is the nature of these books that have caused so much dispute?
      In the first place they are useful in giving a history of Judaism as it
      existed between the close of the Old Testament and the opening of the New
      Testament, and in that regard they are on a par with the writings of
      Josephus and Philo and other authors of the time. They do not give a
      continuous history, but particularly in 1 and 2 Maccabees they narrate
      important phases of Jewish history. Most of the books, however, must be
      classed as religious novels, pious fiction, abounding in repetitions and
      trivial details which are of little interest to the average reader. They
      contain doctrines that are unscriptural, and stories that are fantastic
      and incredible. The colorful tale of Tobit, for instance, is clearly
      fictitious, written by a pious Jew about 190-170 B.C., and intended to
      provide religious and moral instruction in the form of an adventure story.
      Judith, another popular story, is also clearly fictitious. Ecclesiasticus
      has historical value in that it pictures many aspects of the Judaism of
      Palestine during the second century B.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of the writers claim inspiration for their works, and some
      explicitly disclaim it (Prologue to Ecclesiasticus; 1 Maccabees 4:46,
      9:27; 2 Maccabees 2:23, 15:38). They add nothing essential either to the
      record of God’s dealings with His people Israel as recorded in the Old
      Testament, or to the Christian Gospel as recorded in the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some examples of the numerous errors in these books are: Judith, chapter
      1, vv. 1-7, calls Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians and declares that
      he reigned in Nineveh. But we know that he was king of Babylon (Daniel
      4:4-6,30). In Tobit an angel is represented as telling a lie, claiming
      that he is Azarius, the son of Ananias. But an angel is a created spirit
      and cannot be the son of any human being. The book of Baruch purports to
      have been written by a man of that name who was secretary to Jeremiah
      (1:1). But he quotes from Daniel, and the book of Daniel was not written
      until long after the time of Jeremiah, for Jeremiah wrote at the beginning
      of the 70-year captivity and Daniel at its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the question as to why these books were never accepted by the
      Jews as canonical, Dr. Edward J. Young, Professor of Old Testament in
      Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The answer must be that these books were never regarded as divinely
      inspired. ... Both Judith and Tobit contain historical, chronological and
      geographical errors. The books justify falsehood and deception and make
      salvation to depend upon works of merit. Almsgiving, for example, is said
      to deliver from death (Tobit 12:9, 4:10, 14:10-11).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Judith lives a life of falsehood and deception in which she is
      represented as assisted by God (9:10,13). Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of
      Solomon inculcate a morality based on expediency. Wisdom teaches the
      creation of the world out of pre-existent matter (7:17). Ecclesiasticus
      teaches that giving of alms makes atonement for sin (3:3), and in 1
      Maccabees there are historical and geographical errors. This is not to
      deny many fine and commendable things in the Apocrypha, but the books
      nevertheless show themselves at points to be at variance with divinely
      revealed truth. They were consequently never adopted by the Jews as
      canonical” (Revelation and the Bible , p. 167).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Allan MacRae, Professor of Old Testament in Faith Theological
      Seminary, Philadelphia, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The so-called Apocryphal books of the Old Testament are books written by
      godly Jews and containing only their fallible human ideas. They are in no
      sense the Word of God, nor can they ever become the Word of God. The Jews
      did not consider these books as part of the Word of God. Jesus Christ did
      not set His seal upon them as He did upon the actual books of the Old
      Testament. They are never quoted in the New Testament. There is no
      evidence that any of the apostles ever considered any of the books as, in
      any sense, a part of the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true that many people in the Middle Ages became confused and
      thought that some of these books were part of the Word of God. This is
      because they were included in copies of the Vulgate. However, the man who
      translated the Vulgate into Latin from the original Hebrew never intended
      that they should be so included. St. Jerome, the learned translator of the
      Vulgate, wrote an introduction in which he strongly and clearly expressed
      his belief that only the books that are today included in our Old
      Testament belonged in the Bible, and that the so-called Apocrypha are in
      no sense a portion of God’s Word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Confession of Faith, which presents the views of the
      Presbyterian and Reformed churches, in a statement not designed to forbid
      reading of the books of the Apocrypha, but to differentiate between their
      proper and improper use, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The books commonly called Apocryphal, not being of divine inspiration,
      are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority
      in the Church of God, nor to be otherwise approved, or made use of, than
      other human writings” (Ch. 1, sec. 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lutheran Church in Germany made no official pronouncement regarding
      the Apocrypha, but in the Bible prepared by Martin Luther, which for
      centuries remained the standard Bible of the Lutheran churches at home and
      abroad, it was included but was printed at the end of the Old Testament
      and in smaller print, which was generally understood to mean that it was
      considered as of secondary importance as compared with the Old and New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States do not
      accept the Apocrypha as fully canonical, but they do include some readings
      from those books in their church manual—which indicates that they assign
      those readings a position higher than they give to the good writings of
      outstanding church leaders and near equal authority with the Old and New
      Testament. The sixth of the Thirty-nine Articles calls the Apocryphal
      treatises books which “the Church doth read for example of life and
      instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any
      doctrine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the Eastern Orthodox Church is not clear. It has debated
      the issue through its long history, but has made no final decision. In
      practice it has tended to accept the Apocrypha as authoritative, but it
      has not subjected itself to the rigid ecclesiastical control of doctrine
      as has the Roman Church, and the result is that some church fathers and
      theologians quote it authoritatively while others reject it. The
      Septuagint version of the Old Testament is still in use in the Eastern
      Orthodox Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British and Foreign Bible Society, in 1827, ruled against including
      the Apocrypha in its Bibles, and the American Bible Society has followed
      that example. Nearly all Protestant churches today oppose the use of the
      Apocrypha.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also a considerable number of New Testament Apocryphal books
      which at times circulated among the Jews or the Christians or both. These
      were written during the period from the second to the eighth century, and
      were designed primarily to supplement, or in some instances to correct,
      the canonical books. Dr. Bruce M. Metzger, Professor of New Testament in
      Princeton Theological Seminary, says concerning these books:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the four Gospels say little of Jesus’ infancy, childhood, and
      early manhood, and are silent altogether regarding His experiences during
      the three days in the tomb, several Apocryphal gospels were produced to
      satisfy the pious curiosity of Christians regarding these two periods of
      Jesus’ life. ... Still other gospels were written to support heretical
      doctrines, such as Docetism (the view that Jesus only seemed to be human)
      in the Gospel of the Egyptians, or to minimize the guilt of Pilate, such
      as the Gospel according to Peter and the Gospel of Nicodemus. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The most cogent proof that these books are intrinsically on a different
      plane from the books of the New Testament is afforded by reading them side
      by side with the books of the New Testament and allowing each to make its
      own impression. Then, in the words of M. R. James, ‘it will very quickly
      be seen that there is no question of anyone’s having excluded them from
      the New Testament: they have done that for themselves.’ ... The authors
      did not hesitate to elaborate marvelous tales, and, in the credulous
      temper of that age, almost anything was believed” (Introduction to the
      Apocrypha , pp. 249-250, 262263).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the New Testament Apocryphal or pseudonymous books were: The
      General Epistle of Barnabas, First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,
      Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, Apostolic Constitutions,
      First Book of Hermas, Second Book of Hermas, Third Book of Hermas, various
      epistles of Ignatius, the Gospel of the Infancy of the Savior, a mutilated
      and altered Gospel of John, and the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      These spurious writings, however, were never included in the Roman
      Catholic Bible. The Council of Trent evidently selected only books that
      would help them in their controversy with the Reformers, and none of these
      gave promise of doing that. Furthermore, these books are important, not as
      a reliable source of historical information about the age with which they
      purport to deal (that is, the first centuries of the Christian era), but
      because of what they reveal about the age in which they were produced,
      showing something of the legend, folklore, ignorance, and superstition so
      prevalent in that age in which many of the distinctive doctrines of the
      Roman Church have their roots. That such tales could have been believed
      shows the depth of the ignorance and superstition to which the people were
      accustomed.

    <h2>The Vulgate and Modem Translations</h2>
    <p>
      The official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church is the Latin translation
      of Jerome, called the Vulgate (meaning “common”). Jerome was commissioned
      by Bishop Damasus near the close of the fourth century to prepare a
      standard Latin version of the Bible, and his purpose was to put the Bible
      into the common language of the people in accurate, readable form. Had the
      Roman Catholic Church continued to promote the study of the Bible by the
      common people how different might have the course of church and world
      history! But unfortunately that course was reversed by later popes, the
      Bible was withheld from the people, and to a large extent even from the
      priests. Only in recent years has Rome given the Bible to the people in
      some countries, and then mostly because of Protestant pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church historian, A. M. Renwick, of Edinburgh, Scotland, in his book,
      The Story of the Church, says: “Jerome (340-420), one of the most
      interesting and picturesque figures in church history, was born in
      northern Dalmatia (now Yugoslavia). He produced the Latin Vulgate Version
      of the Bible, which, even today, is the only version recognized as
      authentic by the Roman Church. ... He spent thirty-four years at
      Bethlehem, where he lived mostly in a cave as a hermit and carried out his
      immense literary and scholarly labors” (p. 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church seems to hold the Latin Vulgate translation of about A.D.
      400, to be infallible. The Council of Trent decreed: “If any one receive
      not, as sacred and canonical, the said books entire with all their
      parts... as they are contained in the Old Latin Vulgate edition... let him
      be anathema!” The Vatican Council of 1870 (the council that set forth the
      doctrine of the infallibility of the pope) reaffirmed the declaration of
      the Council of Trent that “these books of the Old Testament and New
      Testament are to be received as sacred and canonical, in their integrity,
      with all their parts, as they are enumerated in the decree of the said
      council, and are contained in the ancient Latin edition of the Vulgate,”
      adding that “they contain revelation, with no admixture of error” (Chapter
      II).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1590 Sixtus V issued an edition of the Vulgate which he
      declared to be final, and prohibited under an anathema the publication of
      any new editions thereafter unless they should be exactly like that one.
      However, he died soon after, and scholars found numerous errors in his
      edition. Two years later a new edition was published under Pope Clement
      VIII, and that is the one in general use today. Clearly Sixtus V was in
      error— another example of the absurdity of that doctrine which holds that
      the pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals. This doctrine of
      the authority or infallibility of the Vulgate has caused Roman scholars
      much difficulty in recent years, because many errors have been pointed out
      and are now acknowledged by all scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Douay version of the Bible (New Testament, 1582, and
      Old Testament, 1609) was made from the Latin Vulgate, as are the Roman
      Catholic translations into modem languages. The recent Confraternity
      version of the New Testament (1941) carries the notation “Translated from
      the Latin Vulgate.” The inaccuracies of Jerome’s Vulgate are legion, as
      measured by present day scholarship, and the text has not been revised for
      centuries. So even the best of present day Roman Catholic versions,
      according to the notation on its own flyleaf, is a translation of a
      translation—an English translation of a Latin translation of the original
      Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholics pride themselves on a long history. Yet how much more
      accurate are the Protestant translations of the Bible! Protestant scholars
      go back to the original Greek and Hebrew Scriptures, which are much older
      than the Vulgate to which Roman Catholics are bound, and they use all the
      aids that modern scholarship and research can provide. Yet the priests
      tell their people that it is a mortal sin to read a Protestant Bible, and
      they destroy Protestant Bibles wherever possible, allegedly on the grounds
      that they contain error! In 1957 a large stock of Bibles in Madrid, Spain,
      belonging to the British and Foreign Bible Society was seized and burned.
      Yet as Protestants we would not dream of destroying Roman Catholic Bibles.
      Rather we acknowledge that despite their limitations they are quite good
      translations, and that they contain God’s truth in clear enough revelation
      to enlighten any who will read them in a sincere search for truth, that
      apart from their interpretative notes they are surprisingly like our King
      James and American Standard versions. After all, the most distinctive
      features of the Roman Catholic religion come not from their Bibles but
      from their traditions.
    </p>

<div id="Authority" dropdownName="Authority" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Question of Authority</h2>
    <p>
      We have said that the most controversial issue between Protestants and
      Roman Catholics is the question of authority —What is the final seat of
      authority in religion ?—and that Protestants hold that the Bible alone is
      the final rule of faith and practice, while Roman Catholics hold that it
      is the Bible and tradition as interpreted by the church. In actual
      practice the Roman Church, since the infallibility decree of 1870, holds
      that the final seat of authority is the pope speaking for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we need only read church history to discover that when another source
      of authority is placed alongside Scripture as of equal importance,
      Scripture eventually becomes relegated to the background. Whether that
      other source be reason, emotion, or tradition, the inevitable result is
      that it supplants Scripture and causes it gradually to fade away. If that
      other source be reason, we get rationalism. If it be emotion, we get
      mysticism. And if it be tradition, we get ecclesiastical dictation or
      clericalism. In each case the Bible, while still given lip service, is
      effectually superseded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther took his stand
      solidly on the Bible and refused to be moved unless it could be shown that
      his teaching was contrary to the Bible. Summoned to appear before the Diet
      of Worms to give an account of his beliefs, the closing words of his
      masterful address were: “Here I take my stand; I can do no other; so help
      me, God.” It could not be shown that his teaching was contrary to the
      Bible, and his position was unassailable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary and almost immediate result of the Reformation was to bring
      the doctrines of Scripture clearly before men’s minds as the Reformers
      based their teaching squarely on the Scriptures to the exclusion of all
      accumulated tradition. While the Church of Rome declared that “it belongs
      to the church to judge of the true sense of Scripture,” the Reformers,
      both on the Continent and in England, declared that even lay people, with
      the guidance of the Holy Spirit, can interpret Scripture by diligent and
      prayerful searching and reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, of course, that the person who has not been born again, that
      is, the one who has not been the object of the regenerating power of the
      Holy Spirit and who therefore is not a Christian, is not able to
      understand spiritual truth. This too is clearly taught in Scripture: “Now
      the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they
      are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are
      spiritually judged” (1 Corinthians 2:14). But every born again Christian
      has the gift of the Holy Spirit, and is therefore able to understand the
      basic essentials of what God has written. It is also true that many
      people, even among bom again believers, differ on minor points. But that
      is because they have not read the Scriptures carefully enough and compared
      the various parts. The remedy for that is more devoted, patient, diligent
      Bible study. In any event there is no reference whatever in the Bible that
      even hints that God has delegated the interpretation of Scripture to any
      one individual or group of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it be asked how the Church of Rome, which contains important elements
      of truth, has become honeycombed with paganism, how even a professedly
      Christian church has managed to build up a semi-pagan organization, the
      answer is that the illegitimate authority that Rome has given to
      uninspired tradition has produced the effect. That development had an
      almost exact parallel in the nation of Israel. Israel had the inspired
      prophets, but she preferred the pleasing and flattering teachings of the
      false prophets, and so developed a set of traditions which in time came to
      supplant the true teachings of the prophets. In the teachings and writings
      of the false prophets the rulers of the Jews found the things they wanted,
      just as the popes and bishops have found in the manmade traditions of
      their church things which appeal to their selfish and prideful natures and
      which gave them what they wanted under the cover of religion. A study of
      religious errors will show that they have this common characteristic—they
      consist either of additions to Scripture, or of subtractions from
      Scripture, or perhaps a mixture of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not deny, of course, the statement of the Romanists that much of
      what Jesus said and did is not recorded in the Gospels. John says plainly:
      “Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of his disciples,
      which are not written in this book: but these things are written that ye
      may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing
      ye may have life in his name” (20:30-31). But we do maintain that that
      which is written is sufficient. It is Protestant doctrine that the Bible
      contains all that is necessary to salvation, and no other writings or
      church pronouncements are to be regarded as having divine authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous references set forth the sufficiency of Scripture. Nowhere do we
      find even a hint that these need to be supplemented by church councils or
      papal decrees of any kind. Some of these are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this
      word, it is because there is no morning for them” (or as the King James
      Version says, “it is because there is no light in them”) (Isaiah 8:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
      doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness”
      (2 Timothy 3:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal
      life; and these are they which bear witness of me” (John 5:39).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord proclaimed the infallibility of Scripture, for He said: “The
      scriptures cannot be broken” (John 10:35).
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers of the rich man had sufficient evidence because, said Jesus,
      “They have Moses and the prophets” (Luke 16:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus’ rebuke to the Sadducees was, “Ye do err, not knowing the
      scriptures” (Matthew 22:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jesus reasoned with His disciples after His resurrection in regard to
      the purpose and necessity of His death, we are told: “And beginning from
      Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the
      scriptures the things concerning himself’ (Luke 24:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter wrote: “And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto
      ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place. ...
      For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men from God, being
      moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Peter 1:19,21).
    </p>
    <p>
      James quoted Scripture in the Council of Jerusalem to settle the question
      that was at issue (Acts 15:16-18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul repeatedly appealed to Scripture, as when he asks: “For what saith
      the scripture?” (Romans 4:3). And to Timothy he wrote: “From a babe thou
      hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee whole unto
      salvation” (2 Timothy 3:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The diligence of the Bereans in testing all things by Scripture is
      commended: “Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
      they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the
      scriptures daily, whether these things were so” (Acts 17:11). The
      Scriptures which the Bereans had were the Old Testament. They compared
      Paul’s teachings about Jesus with what the Old Testament had predicted.
      They were not theologians or scholars, but ordinary religious people, and
      yet the writer of the book of Acts (Luke) implies that by comparing the
      teachings of the great Apostle Paul with Scripture they were able to
      determine whether he was right or wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the book of Revelation pronounces a blessing on both the reader and
      those who hear: “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words
      of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the
      time is at hand” (1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the sufficiency of Scripture is everywhere assumed. In all these
      cases our Lord and the New Testament writers referred to Scripture as
      clear, authoritative, and final. Never once did they say or imply that
      extra-Scriptural tradition was needed to supplement Scripture, or that any
      man or group of men was authorized to give authoritative interpretations
      of Scripture.

    <h2>Tradition Condemned by the Scriptures</h2>
    <p>
      In New Testament times the Jews had a great body of tradition, the
      accumulation of centuries, which they gave precedence over Scripture. But
      Jesus never mentioned tradition except to condemn it and to warn against
      it. He rebuked the Pharisees with these words: “Ye leave the commandment
      of God, and hold fast the tradition of men. ... Ye reject the commandment
      of God, that ye may keep your tradition... making void the word of God by
      your tradition” (Mark 7:8,9,13). “And he answered and said unto them, Why
      do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition.
      ... Ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition. ... But
      in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of
      men” (Matthew 15:3,6,9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus our Lord rebuked the Pharisees for doing precisely what the Church of
      Rome does today, for substituting a body of human teachings and making it
      equal to or even superior to the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the Old Testament Moses warned against this same danger: “Ye
      shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish
      from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I
      command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2). Paul gave a clear warning against the use
      of tradition: “Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of
      you through his philosophy and with deceit, after the traditions of men,
      after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ” (Colossians 2:8).
      And John, in the final book of the New Testament set forth the severe
      penalty for adding to or taking away from the Word of God: “I testify unto
      every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man
      shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written
      in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
      this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, out of
      the holy city, which are written in this book” (Revelation 22:18-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Roman Church of today we have a perfect illustration of the
      attitude which characterized the Pharisees and scribes, who substituted a
      body of human teachings and made them equal to or even superior to the
      Word of God. In Jesus’ day traditionalism had become so perverse and
      powerful that it finally crucified Him. Religion was so blinded by its own
      distortions of the Word of God that it took the cross to expose it and
      upset it and to reveal the truth once more. In a similar way the Church of
      Rome is following a set of traditions that she has accumulated through the
      centuries, which by her own pronouncements she has elevated to equal
      authority with, or even to superiority over the Word of God. Her purpose,
      of course, is to justify doctrines and practices which have no basis in
      Scripture, or which are in violation of Scripture commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for Rome to defend her use of tradition, which admittedly came
      into use long after the New Testament was completed, it was necessary for
      her to assert that the authority of the church is superior to that of the
      Scriptures. Protestantism holds that the Scriptures are the infallible
      rule of faith and practice, and that the church as an institution and all
      believers must be governed by that authority. The Church of Rome, on the
      other hand, holds that she is the supreme authority in matters of faith
      and practice. She even attempts to say that the Roman Catholic Church
      produced the Bible, and that the pope as the vicar of Christ on earth has
      the right to legislate for the church. But such claims are absurd, because
      the New Testament was completed in the first century of the Christian era
      while the Roman Catholic Church with its distinctive features and its
      separate existence did not come into being until about four centuries
      later. Furthermore, the sin and corruption that have characterized the
      Roman Church, particularly during the Middle Ages when so many of her
      doctrines and practices originated, is proof that she is in no sense
      superior to the Bible but quite the contrary. But because of that
      teaching, the average Roman Catholic may not be particularly impressed
      when it is pointed out to him that the doctrines of purgatory, the mass,
      indulgences, penance, the use of images, etc., are not in Bible or even
      that they are contrary to the Bible. He believes these things, not because
      he has Scriptural authority for them, but because the church teaches them.
      This again shows how pernicious can be the use of tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason that the Jews had departed from their Scriptures was that they
      accepted tradition and the decisions of their councils as their guide of
      faith. The Roman Church has made the same mistake. She, too, has
      compromised the truth of the Bible in order to follow tradition. When she
      began putting herself on a par with Scripture she found it impossible to
      stop there. The next step was to place herself above Scripture, and she
      has assumed that position ever since.

    <h2>The Protestant Attitude toward the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      The first complete English Bible was translated by John Wycliffe, “the
      morning star of the Reformation,” about 1382. Before his time there was no
      Bible in English, although a few fragmentary portions had been translated.
      Wycliffe knew only the Latin Bible, so his version, like the Roman
      Catholic versions even to the present day, was a translation of a
      translation. The first English New Testament translated from the original
      Greek was that of William Tyndale, in 1525-26. That work was made possible
      through the publication of the Greek New Testament by Erasmus a few years
      earlier. But since the church authorities in England (Henry VIII was king
      and also the head of the church) did not want the people to have the Bible
      in their own language, Tyndale was forbidden to carry on his work in
      England. He went instead to Germany, where the work of Luther had provided
      a hospitable environment for such a venture. His work was completed and
      published in the city of Worms, in 1526. However, it was condemned by the
      English government, and in order to gain entrance into England had to be
      smuggled in a few copies at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tyndale eventually paid with his life for his devotion to the Bible.
      Having taken up residence in Antwerp, Belgium, opposition to his work
      began and continued until he was arrested and condemned. In 1536 he was
      put to death by strangling and his body was burned. His dying words were,
      “O God, open the king of England’s eyes.” That prayer was answered, and
      God opened the eyes of Henry VIII. In 1536 there appeared the Miles
      Coverdale version of the Bible, which also was published outside England,
      but which circulated with considerable freedom in England. And in 1539 the
      second edition was published in England and circulated freely. Coverdale
      was the friend and colleague of Tyndale, and the translation was largely
      Tyndale’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next important translation was the Geneva Bible, translated during the
      reign of Roman Catholic Queen Mary Tudor by a group of English scholars,
      exiles in Geneva, Switzerland, hence its name. This became the Bible of
      the intrepid John Knox and of the early Puritans. It seems to have been
      the Bible used by Shakespeare. The next important translation was the King
      James version, published in 1611. This was the Bible usually used by
      Cromwell’s army and the Scottish Covenanters, also used by John Bunyan. It
      was brought to this country by the Pilgrims and Puritans. To this day it
      continues to be the most popular of all English versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until the time of the Reformation the Bible had been a book for priests
      only. It was written in Latin, and the Roman Church refused to allow it to
      be translated into the languages of the common people. But when the
      Reformers came on the scene all of that was changed. Luther translated the
      entire Bible into German for the people of his native land, and within 25
      years of its appearance one hundred editions of the German Bible came off
      the press. It was also soon translated into most of the vernacular tongues
      of Europe, and wherever the light of the Reformation went it became the
      book of the common people. Decrees of popes and church councils gave way
      to the Word of Life. The Protestant churches of Europe and America have
      labored earnestly to put the Bible into the hands of the people in their
      own languages and have urged the people everywhere to read it for
      themselves. Protestant Bible societies now circulate more copies of the
      Bible each year than were circulated in the fifteen centuries that
      preceded the Reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the 1983 report of the American Bible Society, about
      2,000,000 copies of the complete Bible, Old and New Testaments, are
      printed in the United States each year, and more than 3,000,000 copies of
      the New Testament, and many millions of portions of the Bible (at least
      one book, usually one of the Gospels) are printed each year. And the 1984
      report says that the complete Bible is now available in 286 languages and
      dialects, the New Testament in 594 more, and some portion of the Bible in
      928 more, making a total of 1,808 languages and dialects into which the
      Bible or some part of it has been translated. Today the Bible is available
      in whole or in part in the native tongues of probably 96 percent of the
      people of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, late Presbyterian minister in Pittsburgh, has well
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Protestants have been the pioneers in Bible translation and have
      organized and supported the great world-encircling Bible societies. They
      believe that the Bible needs no other interpreter than the Holy Spirit.
      The Bible read under the guidance of the Holy Spirit is the Christian’s
      authoritative guide. Protestants therefore claim that they truly represent
      and interpret Christianity as it is set forth in the Bible. They hold that
      anyone who will read the Bible prayerfully, with the aid of the best
      scholarship, will reach the conclusion that Protestantism honestly
      interprets the teachings and confirms the practice of early Christianity”
      (booklet, WThat Protestants Believe , p. 8).
    </p>
    <p>And another says:</p>
    <p>
      “The fact is, the Bible was written for the common people. The language of
      the Old Testament was the language spoken in the homes and market places
      of the Hebrews. The New Testament Greek was not the classical Greek of an
      earlier period but the Greek spoken by the common people. It was called
      the koine , which means the common language, what we would call today
      ‘newspaper language.’ This shows that God intended the common people to
      understand the Bible. Any man with ordinary intelligence and able to read
      English can read and learn that Jesus is the Saviour of sinners” (Edward
      J. Tunis, booklet, What Rome Teaches , p. 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protestant ideal is that everyone should read the Bible. Right here,
      we believe, is the reason that the Protestant nations—the United States,
      England, Scotland, Holland, and the Scandinavian nations—have followed one
      line of development, while the Roman Catholic nations—Italy, Spain,
      France, and the Latin American nations—have followed a distinctly
      different pattern. Protestants believe that those who study the Bible in
      sincerity and with prayer will have no difficulty in understanding its
      basic truths. The words of Jesus, previously quoted, imply that the common
      people should know the Bible and that they are able to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is virtually axiomatic that where there is an open Bible, men will not
      long remain in bondage. But by the same token where the Bible is a closed
      book, men soon find themselves in darkness and servitude. Everywhere it
      has been the precursor of civilization and liberty, driving out barbarity
      and despotism as bats and vermin flee from the sunshine. In every land
      where its free and unrestrained reading has been encouraged, it has
      dispelled ignorance and superstition.

    <h2>The Roman Catholic Attitude toward the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      In contrast with the Protestant attitude toward the Bible, the Roman
      Church has traditionally opposed its free use by the people. Even today in
      the predominantly Roman Catholic countries, it keeps the Bible from the
      people, or at least makes no effort to provide it for them. The result is
      that the people in those countries know practically nothing about the
      Bible except as some Protestant organizations have gone in and distributed
      copies. In countries where the Roman Church is in keen competition with
      Protestantism it has allowed the people to have the Bible if there is a
      demand for it, but it has always insisted strenuously that the version
      must be the Douay, or more recently the Confraternity, each of which
      contains a set of notes printed on the same page with the text and giving
      the Roman Catholic interpretation of disputed passages. Even to this day
      any other version, even the Bible as such without note or comment, is
      suspect. The alleged reason is that these versions contain “errors.” But
      the real reason is that the Church of Rome does not want the Bible read
      apart from her interpretative notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible was first officially forbidden to the people by the Church of
      Rome and placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by the Council of Valencia
      (a cathedral city in southeastern Spain) in the year 1229, with the
      following decree:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We prohibit also the permitting of the laity to have the books of the Old
      and New Testament, unless any one should wish, from a feeling of devotion,
      to have a psalter or breviary for divine service, or the hours of the
      blessed Mary. But we strictly forbid them to have the abovementioned books
      in the vulgar tongue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we see that the Bible was forbidden to the laity, except for the
      Psalms or breviary (book of devotions), and even then it could be only is
      Latin—which of course placed it beyond the reach of the common people.
      That decree was passed at the time the Waldensians were gaining strength,
      and it was enforced with bitter persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent reaffirmed that decree and prohibited the use of the
      Scriptures by any member of the church unless he obtained permission from
      his superior. The decree read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In as much as it is manifest, from experience, that if the Holy Bible,
      translated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to
      everyone, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise from
      it; it is, on this point, referred to the judgment of the bishops, or
      inquisitors, who may, by the advice of the priest or confessor, permit the
      reading of the Bible translated into the vulgar tongue by Catholic
      authors, to those persons whose faith and piety, they apprehend, will be
      augmented, and not injured by it; and this permission they must have in
      writing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To this decree, as to more than a hundred others passed by this council,
      was attached an anathema against anyone who should dare to violate it, and
      also penalties were fixed against the illegal possessor or seller of
      books. Here we observe particularly the statement that the reading of the
      Bible in the native tongue will do “more evil than good”! Imagine that, as
      the deliberate teaching of a church professing to be Christian! How
      insulting to God is such teaching, that His Word as read by the people
      will do more evil than good! That attitude toward the Word of God is the
      mark, not of a true church, but of a false church.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it has been the policy of the Roman Church to withhold the Bible
      from the people, Peter, the alleged founder of that church, refers to
      Scripture as “the word of prophecy made more sure,” and likens it to “a
      lamp shining in a dark place” (2 Peter 1:19). What a blessing it would be
      to the world if the Roman Church would really follow the teaching of
      Peter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the history of Israel God instructed Moses to make the words of
      the law known and easily accessible to all the people: “And thou shalt
      teach them diligently unto thy children, and thou shalt talk of them when
      thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest in the way, and when thou
      liest down, and when thou risest up. ... And thou shalt write them upon
      the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates” (Deuteronomy 6:7-9).
      Another verse which expresses the preciousness of Scripture and its
      importance to the individual is Psalm 119:11: “Thy word have I hid in my
      heart, that I might not sin against thee.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Even where permission to read the Bible is granted by the Council of
      Trent, to those who presumably are so thoroughly indoctrinated with Roman
      Catholicism that nothing will shake their faith, that permission must be
      in writing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Liguori, one of the highest authorities on Canon Law, whose books probably
      are considered more authoritative and probably are quoted more often than
      those of any other writer, says: “The Scriptures and books of Controversy
      may not be permitted in the vulgar tongue, as also they cannot be read
      without permission.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Four different popes during the eighteenth century made pronouncements
      against giving the Bible to the people in their own language, typical of
      which was that of Clement XI (1713) in the Bull Unigenitus : “We strictly
      forbid them (the laity) to have the books of the Old and New Testament in
      the vulgar tongue.” As for the Encyclical of Leo XIII (1893) on “The Study
      of the Bible,” sometimes quoted by Roman Catholics as a statement urging
      the laity to study the Bible, it should be observed that (1) the Bible
      which was cited for study was the Latin Vulgate, which of course was not
      available to the common people nor understood by them; (2) the statement
      forbade them to interpret it otherwise than as the church interpreted it;
      and (3) it did not rescind or modify the prior law of the church which
      refused the free use of the Scriptures to the laity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the teaching and practice of the Roman Church for centuries. For
      one to possess or read the Bible in his native tongue without permission
      in writing from his superior and under the watchful eye of the bishop was
      a mortal sin, for which absolution could not be granted until the book was
      delivered to the priest. As the top-heavy structure of law and ritual
      developed, the Bible had to be denied to the people. Otherwise they would
      have seen that it was merely a manmade structure. On the other hand, the
      Bible had to be preserved as a reference book for the theologians and
      priests in order to sustain the power of the priesthood by plausible and
      elastic interpretations of certain texts. But so far as the people were
      concerned it might as well have been forgotten. Small wonder it is that
      ignorance, superstition, poverty, and low moral conditions have been so
      characteristic of Roman Catholic countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Protestant countries, however, in recent years a considerable change
      has taken place in Roman Catholic practice, and, shamed into a different
      attitude because of Protestant criticism, the Roman Church now grants her
      people the privilege of reading the Bible, and even stocks it in the book
      stores—using, of course, only the approved versions. The Roman Church does
      not wish to appear to be the foe of the Bible, so indefensible is that
      position. An annual “Catholic Bible Week” has been instituted, and
      indulgences granted for reading the Bible at least fifteen minutes each
      day. But this appears to be an unnatural emphasis, by no means given with
      a clear conscience permitted but not looked upon favorably by the
      authorities in Rome. Significantly, no similar program of Bible reading
      has been instituted in the predominantly Roman Catholic countries. Only in
      Protestant countries, and primarily in the United States, is this policy
      followed. And it certainly comes very late in the long, long history of
      the Roman Church. One can easily guess what the result would be if for
      some reason the Protestant influence were removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, it still is a mortal sin for a Roman Catholic anywhere to
      read the King James, American Standard, Revised Standard, or any other
      Protestant version. So, even the Bible as such remains on the Index of
      Forbidden Books!<sup>1</sup> It is made fit for a Roman Catholic to read
      only when it is annotated by an authorized theologian! What St. Paul
      wrote, if it stands by itself, is on the Index. What was written by St.
      Peter himself, who according to Roman Catholic tradition was the first
      pope, is on the Index unless some Roman Catholic annotates his writing.
      Yet the Roman Church does not claim infallibility for the theologian who
      annotates it! So here we have the very height of absurdity—it takes the
      work of a theologian who is not infallible to correct and edit and make
      lawful and orthodox the text of those who wrote by divine inspiration! The
      attitude of the Roman Church toward the Bible societies has been one of
      sustained opposition. Several acts of the popes have been directed
      exclusively against them. In 1824 Pope Leo XII, in an encyclical letter
      said: “You are aware, venerable brethren, that a certain society called
      the Bible society strolls with effrontery throughout the world, which
      society, contrary to the well-known decree of the Council of Trent, labors
      with all its might and by every means to translate—or rather to
      pervert—the Scriptures into the vulgar tongue of every nation. ... We, in
      conformity with our apostolic duty, exhort you to turn away your flock by
      all means from these poisonous pastures.” In 1844 Pope Gregory XVI again
      condemned these societies, and Pope Pius IX, author of the decree of papal
      infallibility, who died in 1878, denounced “these cunning and infamous
      societies, which call themselves Bible societies, and give the Scriptures
      to inexperienced youth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> Technically the Index was dropped in 1965, but general
      supervision over books allowed continues through the newly established
      magazine supervision Nuntius (Herald). The imprimatur remains in force,
      and gives another effective means of control. Since the Second Vatican
      Council, restrictions against other versions have been relaxed to some
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in reality who can estimate the vast good that these noble
      organizations and their faithful colporteurs have brought to the nations
      of the world? Most prominent among these have been the British and Foreign
      Bible Society, the American Bible Society, the Bible Society of Scotland,
      and that of the Netherlands, which have translated the Scriptures into
      hundreds of languages and dialects, and which now circulate millions of
      copies of the Bible every year. Many times Bibles have been publicly
      burned by the priests. That the real attitude of the Vatican toward the
      Bible has not changed is shown by the fact that in 1957 the depot of the
      British and Foreign Bible Society in Madrid, Spain, was closed and its
      stock of Bibles confiscated and burned. After the Spanish civil war, which
      brought Franco and the Roman Catholic Church to power, Spanish children
      returning from hospitable Swiss families with Bibles in their pockets were
      forced at the Spanish frontier to hand those precious books over to the
      local priest. Time and again in Colombia during the past ten years Bibles
      have been taken from Protestants by fanatical Romanist groups and burned,
      almost always at the instigation of the local priests, usually in
      communities where new Protestant churches were being formed. The fact
      remains that only in those countries where Protestantism is dominant does
      the Bible circulate freely. Think of the popes, who profess to be God’s
      representatives on earth, forbidding their people and all others to read
      God’s own Book of Life! Surely the Church of Rome by such action proves
      itself apostate and false.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, for a thousand years, from the early sixth century to the sixteenth
      century, while the Roman Church held sway, the Bible remained a closed
      book. The Roman Church, instead of being a kingdom of light, became a
      kingdom of darkness, promoting ignorance and superstition and holding the
      people in bondage. In most Roman Catholic countries today the Bible
      remains a closed book. Only since the time of the Protestant Reformation
      has it circulated freely in any country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among evangelical Christians in the United States there are thousands of
      classes studying the Bible. But among Roman Catholics such groups are very
      rare. Even a brief discussion with Roman Catholics will reveal that they
      know very little about the doctrines or the history of their church, and
      that they know almost nothing at all about the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome’s traditional policy of seeking to limit the circulation of the Bible
      and of anathematizing or destroying all copies that are not annotated with
      her distinctive doctrines shows that she is really afraid of it. She is
      opposed to it because it is opposed to her. The plain fact is that she
      cannot hold her people when they become spiritually enlightened and
      discover that her distinctive doctrines are merely manmade inventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious fact in regard to the Index of Forbidden Books is that the Roman
      Church permits the reading of some books by ecclesiastical writers outside
      her fold when those books contain nothing contrary to her doctrines. Even
      some heathen books are allowed to adults, because of their “elegance and
      propriety.” But not the Bible—unless it carries her interpretation! The
      traditional attitude of the Roman Catholic Church toward the promotion and
      study of the Bible has been, we believe, the greatest spiritual and
      cultural tragedy since the influx of the pagans into the church in the
      fourth century.

    <h2>Interpreting the Bible</h2>
    <p>
      While the Roman Catholic people in the United States have access to the
      Bible, they are told that they cannot understand it and that it must be
      interpreted for them by the church speaking through the priest. People
      ordinarily do not waste their time reading a book that they are persuaded
      they cannot understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests in turn are pledged not to interpret the Bible for themselves,
      but only as the church interprets it, and according to “the unanimous
      consent of the fathers.” But the church has never issued an official
      commentary giving that interpretation. And as we have pointed out earlier,
      the unanimous consent of the fathers is purely a myth, for there is
      scarcely a point of doctrine on which they do not differ. The doctrine of
      the immaculate conception, for instance, was denied by Anselm,
      Bonaventura, and Thomas Aquinas, three of the greatest Roman theologians.
      Yet Rome presumes to teach that Mary was bom without sin, and that that is
      the unanimous teaching of the fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their insistence on following an official interpretation, the Roman
      Catholics are pursuing a course similar to that of the Christian
      Scientists, who also have the Bible but insist that it must be interpreted
      by Mary Baker Eddy’s book, Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures
      , and that of the Mormons, who likewise have the Bible but interpret it by
      the Book of Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical result of the priests and people being told that they cannot
      interpret the Bible for themselves is that they read it but very little.
      Why should they? They cannot understand it. They may read a few pages here
      and there, but even among the priests there is scarcely one in twenty who
      reads it from beginning to end and really studies it. Instead the priests
      spend hours reading their breviaries, books of daily devotions and
      prayers, as required by their church, but which are of human origin. This
      practice of representing the Bible as a mysterious book is a part of
      Rome’s over-all program of presenting Christianity as a mystery religion,
      in which the mass in particular as well as various other practices are set
      forth as mysteries which are not to be understood but which are to be
      accepted with implicit faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests and the people alike look upon the Bible as a mysterious book,
      and anyway the interpretation is given to them in pope’s decrees and
      church council pronouncements, which are declared to be clearer and more
      easily understood. Furthermore, these latter supersede Scripture.
      Experience proves that whenever an interpretation becomes more important
      than a document, the document becomes buried and the interpretation alone
      survives. For this reason the average Roman Catholic is faithful to his
      church but neglects his Bible. Instead of following the teachings of God
      the priests and people follow the traditions of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fraudulent claim recently put forth by the Knights of Columbus in a
      series of newspaper and magazine ads designed to appeal to Protestants and
      others is that the Roman Catholic Church produced the Bible and that we
      received it from her. Some of her spokesmen attempt to say that the canon
      of the Bible was established in the fourth century, by the pope and
      council of Carthage, in A.D. 397. But that statement is erroneous on two
      counts. In the first place, there was no pope as such in A.D. 397. It was
      not until the Council of Chalcedon, in 451, that the bishop of Rome was
      designated pope, and the authority of the bishop of Rome never has been
      acknowledged by the Eastern churches. Previous to that time all priests
      and bishops were called popes (Latin, papa), and in the Eastern churches
      that title is applied to ordinary priests even to the present day. The
      Council of Chalcedon attempted to restrict the title exclusively to the
      bishop of Rome, who at that time was Leo I, and conferred it posthumously
      on all previous bishops of Rome in order to make it appear that an
      unbroken succession of popes had proceeded from Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the second place, the New Testament was produced during the first
      century of the Christian era and had assumed its present form centuries
      before the Roman Catholic Church developed its distinctive
      characteristics. At that time the Eastern churches were dominant in
      Christian affairs, and the Church in Rome was relatively insignificant.
      Gregory I, called Gregory the Great, who was consecrated pope in 590 and
      died in 604, was in effect the founder of the papal system. He reorganized
      the church, revised the ritual, restored monastic discipline, attempted to
      enforce celibacy among the clergy, and extended the authority of the Roman
      Church into many countries adjacent to Italy. He more than anyone else
      gave the Roman Church its distinctive form and set the course that it was
      to follow in its later history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, long before the Council of Carthage, the particular books now
      found in the New Testament, and only those, had come to be looked upon by
      the church at large as the inspired and infallible Word of God on the
      basis of their genuineness and authority. These particular writings, in
      distinction from all other books of that age, manifest within themselves
      this genuineness and authority as we read them; and the Council of
      Carthage did not so much choose the books that were to be accepted in the
      New Testament, but rather placed its stamp of approval on the selection
      that by that time, under the providential control of the Holy Spirit, had
      come to be looked upon by the church as the New Testament canon. The Old
      Testament canon was completed and had assumed its present form long before
      the coming of Christ. The Roman Church, of course, had nothing whatever to
      do with that.
