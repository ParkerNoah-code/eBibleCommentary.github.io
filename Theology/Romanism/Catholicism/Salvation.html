    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      In the Roman system penance is one of the seven sacraments, the fourth in
      the series. The word, however, is used two different senses. As a
      sacrament, and in the broad sense, it refers to the act of confession on
      the part of the penitent, together with the priest’s pronouncement of
      absolution and his assigning of certain works to be done by the penitent.
      In the narrow sense penance has reference only to the works assigned by
      the priest and their performance by the penitent. The Baltimore Catechism
      defines penance as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Penance is the sacrament by which sins committed after baptism are
      forgiven through the absolution of the priest” (p. 300).
    </p>
    <p>Another catechism, published in New York, says:</p>
    <p>
      “The priest gives penance in Confession, to help me to make up for the
      temporal punishment I must suffer for my sins. The penance given to me by
      the priest does not always make full satisfaction for my sins. I should,
      therefore, do other acts of penance... and try to gain indulgences.”
      [Indulgences are remissions of so many days or months or years of
      punishment in purgatory.]
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a Roman Catholic training book. Instructions for Non-Catholics, we
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the sacrament of penance, God gives the priest the power to bring
      sinners back into the state of grace and to prevent them from falling into
      the abyss of hell. Moreover, after confession some temporal punishment due
      to sin generally remains, and some of this punishment is taken away in the
      penance (prayers) the priest gives you to say. You should perform other
      acts of penance also so that you can make up for the temporal punishment
      due to sin and to avoid a long stay in purgatory. The Church suggests to
      us these forms of penance: prayer, fasting, giving alms in the name of
      Christ, the spiritual and corporal works of mercy, the patient sufferings
      of the ills of life, and the gaining of indulgences” (p. 95).

    <h2>Penance as a System of Works</h2>
    <p>
      Penance, as the catechisms say, involves confession of one’s sins to a
      priest and the doing of good works as the only way by which sins committed
      after baptism can be forgiven. According to the Roman system God has
      established a tribunal on earth in which the priest sits as judge, through
      which the penitent receives absolution and an assignment of works to be
      performed, in doing which he shows his sorrow for sin. According to this
      view God does not cancel out all the punishment due to the sinner when he
      forgives his sins. No limit is set to the works and services that can be
      demanded. The poor sinner is always left at the mercy of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Rome thus demands acts of penance before she grants
      forgiveness, inferring that the sacrifice of Christ was not sufficient to
      atone fully for sin and that it must be supplemented to some extent by
      these good works. But what God demands is not acts of penance, but
      repentance , which means turning from sin, vices, injustice, and all
      wickedness in whatever form: “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
      unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, and he will
      have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon”
      (Isaiah 55:7). From the Greek New Testament edited by Erasmus, Luther
      discovered that Jesus did not say, “Do penance,” as interpreted by the
      Roman Church, but “Repent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestantism is primarily a reassertion of New Testament Christianity,
      the teaching that salvation is by faith rather than works. Romanism, on
      the other hand, teaches that salvation depends ultimately upon ourselves,
      upon what we do, that one can “earn” salvation by obedience to the laws of
      the church, indeed that the saints can even store up excess merits in
      heaven beyond the requirements of duty, through such things as regular
      attendance at church, masses, rosary prayers, fastings, the wearing of
      medals, crucifixes, scapulars, etc. These excess merits Rome calls “works
      of supererogation.” Mary and the saints are said to have stored up vast
      treasures of merit, from which the pope can draw and dispense to the
      faithful as they perform the works assigned by the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop Fulton J. Sheen expresses this doctrine in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Through them, the Church gives her penitents a fresh start. And the
      Church has a tremendous spiritual capital, gained through centuries of
      penance, persecution, and martyrdom; many of her children prayed,
      suffered, and merited more than they needed for their own individual
      salvation. The Church took these superabundant merits and put them into
      the spiritual treasury, out of which repentant sinners can draw in times
      of spiritual depression” (Peace of Soul, p. 208).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed is salvation by works. This is the bondage in which the Church
      of Rome keeps its millions of adherents. But against all this futility of
      human works stand the simple words of Scripture. In response to the
      question, “What must I do to be saved?” the Scripture answers simply and
      clearly: “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved” (Acts
      16:30-31). Dr. Woods has well said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Penance is a wholly different thing from Gospel repentance. Penance is an
      outward act; repentance is of the heart. Penance is imposed by a Roman
      priest; repentance is the work of the Holy Spirit. Penance is supposed to
      make satisfaction for sin. But nothing that the sinner can do or suffer
      can satisfy the divine justice. Only the Lord Jesus Christ can do that,
      and He did it once for all when He made atonement on the cross and
      completely satisfied the divine law. Rome’s error is like that of the
      heathen religions, seeking to win forgiveness or deliverance from sin by
      self-inflicted or priest-imposed punishment. Such are the tortures of
      Buddhist and Hindu devotees.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What God desires in the sinner is not a punishment of oneself for sins,
      but a change of heart, a real forsaking of sin, shown by a new life of
      obedience to God’s commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In short, penance is a counterfeit repentance. It is the work of man on
      his body; true repentance is the work of God in the soul. The divine Word
      commands: ‘Rend your heart, and not your garments’ (Joel 2:13). Penance is
      ‘rending the garments’; an outward form without inward reality, which
      Christ commands His people not to do” (Our Priceless Heritage , p. 132).
    </p>
    <p>
      In all Roman Catholic catechisms and theological books which deal with
      this subject it is taught that God grants forgiveness only to those who,
      on their part, try to atone for their sins through worthy fruits of
      penance. In the words of the French catechism, “Our satisfaction must be
      in proportion to the number and measure of our sins.” This false teaching,
      that forgiveness is only partial and that it is given only for a price, is
      the real basis of the Roman Catholic doctrine of salvation, and must
      always be kept in mind in any effective controversy with Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, while Romanism teaches that Christ died for our sins, it
      also teaches that His sacrifice was not sufficient, that our sufferings
      must be added to make it effective. In accordance with this, many have
      tried to earn salvation by fastings, rituals, flagellations, and good
      works of various kinds. But those who attempt such a course always find
      that it is impossible to do enough to earn salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-inflicted suffering cannot make atonement for sin. To suffer as a
      Christian in defense of a righteous cause serves to identify one with his
      Lord and Master. But we cannot choose our own course of discipline, for
      “We are His workmanship.” We can only submit to His will. Each receives a
      discipline divinely suited to him and, as a living stone, each is polished
      for his unique setting when the Lord of Glory makes up His jewels. It has
      been the sad history of the Roman Church that while making much of outward
      evidences of humility and suffering on the part of its people as
      administered through its doctrine of penance, its priests, bishops,
      cardinals, and popes have flouted those principles and usually have lived
      in luxury and splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easy way in which the Church of Rome deals with sin is seen in this
      doctrine of penance. She does not require genuine repentance and sorrow
      for sin, nor any genuine purpose to turn from it, but accepts as a
      substitute an act of allegiance to the church and the penitent’s “fear of
      punishment.” Accordingly, the penitent receives pardon on comparatively
      easy terms, particularly so if he is on good terms with the priest. He is
      assigned some task to perform, usually not too hard or irksome, sometimes
      merely the recital of a given number of “Hail Mary’s.” The result is that
      he has no scruples about resuming his evil course. But the Bible teaches
      that the first duty of a sinner who is moved to true repentance is to
      confess his sin to God, and to Him alone, and to turn effectively from his
      sin. “If we confess our sins,” says John, “he is faithful and righteous to
      forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John
      1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The basic and fatal error of Romanism,” says Dr. C. D. Cole, “is the
      denial of the sufficiency of Christ as Saviour. It denies the efficacy of
      His sacrifice on the cross. Romanism has a Christ, but He is not
      sufficient as a Savior. What He did on Calvary must be repeated (in the
      mass) and supplemented (through works of penance), and this makes
      priestcraft and sacramentarianism necessary. Romanism is a complicated
      system of salvation by works. It has salvation to sell, but not on
      Isaiah’s terms—without money and without price (Isaiah 55:1). It offers
      salvation on the installment plan, and then sees to it that the poor
      sinner is always behind in his payments, so that when he dies there is a
      large balance unpaid, and he must continue payments by sufferings in
      purgatory, or until the debt is paid by prayers, alms and sufferings of
      his living relatives and friends. The whole system and plan calls for
      merit and money, from the cradle to the grave, and even beyond. Surely the
      wisdom that drew such a plan of salvation is not from above, but is
      earthly and sensual” (sermon delivered in the Jarvis Street Baptist
      Church, Toronto).
    </p>
    <p>
      Good works, of course, are pleasing to God, and they have an important and
      necessary place in the life of the Christian. They naturally follow if one
      has true faith, and they are performed out of love and gratitude to God
      for the great salvation that has been bestowed. If any professing
      Christian does not want to obey the Bible and live a good Christian life,
      that is proof that his faith is not sincere. Good works, in other words,
      are not the cause and basis of salvation, not what the person does to earn
      salvation, but rather the fruits and proof of salvation—“Not by works done
      in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he
      saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy
      Spirit” (Titus 3:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The born again Christian produces good works as naturally as the grape
      vine produces grapes. They are a part of his very nature. He performs them
      not to get saved but because he is saved. And it is to be observed further
      that the distinguishing mark of a saint is not, as in the Roman Church,
      what one has done for God, but what God has done for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penance is, therefore, merely another clever tool or scheme to control
      those who are ignorant of the Biblical way of salvation. We should confess
      all our sins to God, and to Him alone, and we need confess our personal
      shortcomings only to those who may have been injured by us.

    <h2>Salvation by Grace</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible declares that the salvation of sinners is a matter of grace.
      From Ephesians 1:7-10 we learn that the primary purpose of God in the work
      of redemption was to display the glory of this divine attribute so that
      through succeeding ages the intelligent universe might admire it as it is
      made known through His unmerited love and boundless goodness to guilty,
      vile, helpless creatures. Accordingly all men are represented as sunk in a
      state of sin and misery, from which they are utterly unable to deliver
      themselves. When they deserved only God’s wrath and curse, He determined
      that He would graciously provide redemption for a vast number. To that end
      Christ, the second person of the Trinity, assumed our nature and guilt,
      and obeyed and suffered in our stead; and the Holy Spirit was sent to
      apply that redemption to individual souls. On the same representative
      principle by which Adam’s sin is imputed to us that is, set to our account
      in such a way that we are held responsible for it and suffer the
      consequences of it although not personally responsible for it, our sin in
      turn is imputed to Christ, and His righteousness is imputed to us. This is
      briefly yet clearly expressed in the Westminster Shorter Catechism
      (Presbyterian), which says: “Justification is an act of God’s free grace,
      wherein He pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous in His
      sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by
      faith alone” (Ans. to Q. 33).
    </p>
    <p>
      The word “grace” in its proper sense means the free and undeserved favor
      of God exercised toward the undeserving, toward sinners. It is something
      that is given irrespective of any worthiness in man, and to introduce
      works or merit into any part of the system vitiates its nature and
      frustrates its design. Just because it is grace, it is not given on the
      basis of preceding merits. It cannot be earned. As the very name imports,
      it is necessarily gratuitous; and since man in his fallen nature is
      enslaved to sin until it is given, all the merits that he can have prior
      to it are demerits and deserve only punishment, not gifts or favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of His absolute moral perfection God requires spotless purity and
      perfect obedience in His intelligent creatures. This perfection is
      provided for His people in that Christ’s spotless righteousness is imputed
      to them, so that when God looks upon the redeemed He sees them clothed not
      with anything properly their own, but with this spotless robe. We are told
      that Christ suffered as a substitute, “the just for the unjust.” And when
      man is encouraged to think that he owes to some power or art of his own
      that salvation which in reality is all of grace, God is robbed of part of
      His glory. By no stretch of the imagination can a man’s good works in this
      life be considered a just equivalent for the blessings of eternal life. We
      are in fact, nothing but receivers', we never bring any adequate reward to
      God, we are always receiving from Him, and shall be unto all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All men naturally feel that they should earn their salvation, and a system
      which makes some provision in that regard readily appeals to them. But
      Paul lays the ax to such reasoning when he says: “If there had been a law
      given which could make alive, verily righteousness would been of the law”
      (Galatians 3:21); and Jesus said to His disciples, “When ye shall have
      done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
      servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do” (17:10). We have
      no righteousness of our own; for as Isaiah says: “Our righteousnesses are
      as a polluted garment”—or as the King James Version expresses it, “as
      filthy rags” (64:6). Salvation is based solely on the merits of Christ who
      suffered and died for His people. It is for this reason that God can
      demand perfection of all who enter heaven and yet admit into heaven those
      who have been sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Isaiah wrote, “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
      and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and
      milk without money and without price” (55:1), he invited the penniless,
      the hungry, the thirsty, to come and to take possession of, and to enjoy
      the provision, free of all cost, as if by right of payment. And to buy
      without money must mean that it has already been produced and provided at
      the cost of another. The farther we advance in the Christian life, the
      less we are inclined to attribute any merit to ourselves, and the more to
      thank God for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul says concerning some who would base salvation on their own merit,
      that, “being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish
      their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God”
      (Romans 10:3), and that they were, therefore, not in the church of Christ.
      He makes it plain that “the righteousness of God” is given to us through
      faith, and that we enter heaven pleading only the merits of Christ. Time
      and again the Scriptures repeat the assertion that salvation is of grace,
      as if anticipating the difficulty that men would have in coming to the
      conclusion that they could not earn it by their own works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this system of grace is that those who glory should glory
      only in the Lord, and that no redeemed person should ever have occasion to
      boast over another. Romanism destroys this purely gracious character of
      salvation and substitutes a system of grace plus works. No matter how
      small a part those works may be said to play (and in the Roman system they
      play a conspicuously large part), they are decisive and ultimately they
      are the basis of the distinction between the saved and the lost; for he
      that is saved can then justly point the finger of scorn and say, “You had
      as good chance for salvation as I had. I accepted, and you rejected the
      offer; therefore you deserve to suffer.” But if saved by grace, the
      redeemed remembers the mire from which he was lifted, and his attitude
      toward the lost is one of sympathy and pity. He knows that but for the
      grace of God he too would be in the same state as those who perish, and
      his song is, “Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us. But unto thy name give
      glory, For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake” (Psalm 115:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the Council of Trent, in its opposition to the Reformers’ doctrine
      of justification by faith alone, and in defense of its doctrine of
      penance, declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If anyone saith that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in
      the divine mercy which remits sin for Christ’s sake alone; or, that this
      confidence alone is that whereby we are justified, let him be anathema”
      (Sess. VI, Can. 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking this stand Rome rejects the teaching of Augustine, one of the
      church fathers whom she is most anxious to follow; for Augustine taught
      that salvation is purely by the grace of God, not by human merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against Rome’s anathema Paul declares: “But though we, or an angel from
      heaven should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached
      unto you, let him be anathema” (Galatians 1:8). And again he says: “For as
      many as are under the works of the law are under a curse: for it is
      written, Cursed is every one who continued! not in all the things that are
      written in the book of the law, to do them” (Galatians 3:10), by which he
      teaches that anyone who would earn salvation by keeping the law must
      render perfect obedience—“all the things that are written in the book of
      the law, to do them”—which manifestly is impossible for any human being.
      Hence Paul’s anathema shatters that of Rome, for it is the curse of God
      upon those who teach salvation by works in any form.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this great truth of justification by faith alone that flashed
      through the mind of Martin Luther when, while still a monk, on a
      pilgrimage to Rome he was climbing the scala sancta , the “sacred
      stairway,” one step at a time and on his knees, trying to find peace with
      God. Suddenly the truth burst upon him and he saw the real meaning of the
      verse, “The just shall live by faith” (Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, KJV).
      Immediately he got up on his feet and walked down the steps. How wrong it
      was for anyone to think that he could earn salvation through works of
      penance! Although Luther did not make a formal break with the Roman Church
      until some years later, his action in Rome that day was in reality the
      prelude to the Protestant Reformation.

    <h2>Further Scripture Proof</h2>
    <p>
      New Testament Christianity repudiates the doctrine that the believer must,
      or can, earn his salvation through good works assigned by a priest, or
      that saving grace can be conferred by a priest regardless of his moral
      character, or that such grace is given because of allegiance to any church
      or organization. Instead it teaches that we have only to receive it in
      simple faith. Witness the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      “By grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it
      is the gift of God; not of works that no man should glory” (Ephesians
      2:8-9).
    </p>
    <p>“The righteous shall live by faith” (Romans 1:17).</p>
    <p>
      “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through
      faith in Jesus Christ... because by the works of the law shall no flesh be
      justified” (Galatians 2:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if it is by grace, it is no more works: otherwise grace is no more
      grace” (Romans 11 : 6 ).
    </p>
    <p>
      “If righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for naught”
      (Galatians 2:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
      Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of
      debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
      the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness” (Romans 4:3-5).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
      Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      “He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not
      the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him” (John
      3:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house”
      (Acts 16:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      “But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested
      being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God
      through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe. ... We reckon
      therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the
      law” (Romans 3:21-22,28).
    </p>
    <p>
      What a significant coincidence it is that this doctrine of justification
      by faith is given such prominence in the Epistle to the Romans, since Rome
      later became the seat of the papacy! It seems to be written there as if
      intended as a strong and permanent protest against the errors of the Roman
      Church. For if we believe that we are justified by faith in Christ, who
      died “once for all,” we certainly cannot believe in “the sacrifice of the
      mass” as so many repetitions of that sacrifice on Calvary.

<div id="Indulgences" dropdownName="Indulgences" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Indulgences</h2>
    <p>
      Another subject closely related to penance is that of indulgences. The
      Baltimore Catechism defines an indulgence as follows:
    </p>

      “An indulgence is the remission in whole or in part of the temporal
      punishment due to sin. ... There are two kinds of indulgences—plenary and
      partial. ... A plenary indulgence is the full remission of the temporal
      punishment due to sin. ... A partial indulgence is the remission of a part
      of the temporal punishment due to sin. ... To gain an indulgence we must
      be in the state of grace (the result of a satisfactory confession to a
      priest) and perform the works enjoined.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Another catechism defines an indulgence more briefly as “a remission of
      that temporal punishment which even after the sin is forgiven, has yet to
      be suffered either here or in purgatory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      An indulgence, therefore, is an official relaxation of law which shortens
      or cancels one’s sufferings which are due to sin, and it usually has
      reference to the sufferings in purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indulgences are granted by the pope, who the Roman Church teaches has
      personal jurisdiction over purgatory; and they usually are granted through
      the priests in return for gifts or services rendered to the church or as a
      reward for other good deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      This release from punishment is said to be possible because the church has
      a vast treasury of unused merits which have been accumulated primarily
      through the sufferings of Christ, but also because of the good works of
      Mary and the saints who have done works more perfect than God’s law
      requires for their own salvation. Thus not only the suffering and death of
      Christ, but also the good works of Mary and the saints, are the grounds of
      forgiveness of sins. The church claims to be able to withdraw merits from
      that store and to apply them to any member of the church just as if he had
      suffered what was necessary for the forgiveness of sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indulgence is not, as many think, and as the term might suggest, a
      license to commit sin, although that has been done on numerous occasions
      particularly among the more backward and ignorant people. That was one of
      the abuses that developed during the Middle Ages. An indulgence is rather
      a limited period of release from punishment (1 day, 10 days, 30 days,
      etc.) which the person would have to suffer in purgatory. Indulgences are
      like prison paroles. A man sentenced to imprisonment for one year may be
      released at the end of eight months if he manifests true repentance and
      good behavior. In the same manner an indulgence affords release from a
      part or the whole of the punishment due because of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indulgences are not available to those guilty of mortal sin until they
      confess to a priest and receive absolution. The priest forgives only
      mortal sins in the confessional, which saves the soul from hell. He does
      not forgive venial sins. Those have to be atoned for in the present life,
      or they have to be suffered for in the flames of purgatory after death.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Roman doctrine, all those dying in mortal sin go straight to
      hell, where prayers, masses, etc., cannot effect any alleviation of their
      pains. For those who go to confession, the absolution of the priest
      removes mortal sin and thereby releases from eternal punishment; but the
      punishment remains and must be atoned for by good works, prayers, etc., in
      this life, or by sufferings in purgatory in the next. In practice this
      means that every Roman Catholic, if he escapes hell, must reckon on going
      through purgatory. As we have indicated earlier, there seems to be no very
      definite catalogue of which sins are mortal and which are venial. The
      classification varies from place to place and from priest to priest,
      depending on the priest’s definition and the nature of the purpose to be
      served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the pope can grant a plenary indulgence, canceling out all suffering.
      Bishops can grant up to forty days, and parish priests shorter periods.
      During the Middle Ages plenary indulgences were granted to persons who
      visited the holy sepulcher in Jerusalem, or joined the crusades to regain
      the Holy Land, or helped in the work of persecuting Protestants and
      extirpating heresy. Partial indulgences were granted for lesser services,
      such as reciting the rosary, ritual prayers to the Virgin Mary or to some
      saint, self-denials, gifts of money or property, etc. The list is almost
      endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, indulgences must not be sold by the church. But that rule has
      been violated on many occasions, and the spirit of it on many more. The
      sale is still carried out in countries where Rome is supreme, and where it
      is not calculated to revolt public opinion. The first Pope John XXIII sold
      indulgences openly, but was condemned for it by a church council. The late
      Pope John XXIII, in 1958, granted a plenary indulgence to all who attended
      his coronation ceremony or listened by radio or viewed the ceremony by
      television or news reel. And again, on Easter Sunday, 1961, he granted a
      plenary indulgence to all who attended the Easter observance in St.
      Peter’s Square in Rome. Most indulgences, however, are partial. The Roman
      Church is careful to point out that “only God knows exactly how much of
      the temporal punishment is taken away by an indulgence.” Hence no one can
      ever be sure that he has done enough and that he needs no further
      indulgences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise many “dispensations” or permissions to do certain things not
      approved by the Roman Church are granted each year, such as marriage
      between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, annulments, and even, as in
      Spain until recently, permission on payment of a small fixed sum, to eat
      meat on Friday, which otherwise would be a mortal sin. There is no fixed
      price for “dispensations,” but it is understood by both parties that there
      are to be gifts and that for the more important ones the gifts are to be
      generous.

    <h2>Historical Development of the Doctrine of Indulgences</h2>
    <p>
      The practice of granting indulgences was unknown in the early church. It
      arose in the Middle Ages in connection with penances imposed by the Roman
      Church. At first they were applicable only to the living. Gelasius, bishop
      of Rome in 495, said: “They demand that we should also bestow forgiveness
      of sins upon the dead. Plainly this is impossible for us, for it is said,
      ‘What things soever ye shall bind upon earth.’ Those who are no longer
      upon the earth He has reserved for His own judgment.” Now if this pope was
      infallible in his exegesis of Scripture, the current Roman practice is
      false. In the year 1096, at the Synod of Clermont, Urban II promised a
      plenary indulgence for all who would take part in the crusades. From that
      time on indulgences became a fixed and remunerative part of the religion
      of Rome. Pope Clement VI (1342-1352) proclaimed the doctrine that the
      church has control of a treasury of merit, and that it can give to one
      believer the excess merits of another. And in 1477 Pope Sixtus IV declared
      that indulgences were available for souls in purgatory. Since that time
      indulgences have been considered helpful to the dead as well as to the
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abuses connected with the granting or sale of indulgences became so
      flagrant that clear-thinking men in the clergy and laity alike came to
      despise the practice. Many of the promoters played heartlessly on the
      credulity of the bereaved. The great majority of mankind was pictured as
      suffering in the flames of purgatory until their survivors provided the
      money for their release. The demoralization which resulted from this evil
      practice spread like poison through the church. In 1250 Grosseteste,
      bishop of Lincoln, England, protested to the pope that the low morality of
      the priesthood was due to the purchasable pardon. A commission of
      cardinals reported to Pope Paul III (1534-1549) that pardons and
      dispensations produced indescribable scandals, and begged him to put an
      end to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years indulgences were sold openly. When Pope Leo X (1513-1521) needed
      money to complete the great cathedral of St. Peter’s in Rome he offered
      plenary indulgences for sale and sent his special emissaries to every
      nation, promising forgiveness of sins to the living and release from the
      flames of purgatory for the dead. Those found a ready market in many parts
      of Europe. It was for this purpose that the Friar Tetzel came through the
      region around Wittenburg, Germany, making the claim: “A soul is released
      from purgatory and carried to heaven as soon as the money tinkles in the
      box.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this corrupt practice of taking money from the people that revolted
      Martin Luther against the whole system of indulgences and led to his
      posting the 95 theses on the cathedral door in Wittenburg, Germany,
      October 31 on the eve of All Saints Day, 1517. The act marked the
      beginning of the Protestant Reformation. The 86 th thesis read: “The
      pope’s riches at this day far exceed the wealth of the richest
      millionaires; can not he therefore build one single basilica of St. Peter
      out of his own money, rather than out of the money of the faithful poor?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Luther’s action was in effect a daring challenge to the papal authorities
      for public debate on each of the propositions listed. Needless to say, his
      challenge was not accepted. But it did arouse intense excitement, and it
      met with a ready response in the hearts of the people over a wide area.
      And well might he challenge the indulgence system, for in so doing he was
      simply taking his stand for first century Christianity. We wonder how many
      who visit St. Peter’s cathedral in Rome today realize that the
      construction of that church was the event that set in motion the
      Protestant Reformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question may well be asked: If indulgences are so clearly opposed to
      the Gospel plan of salvation, why did the popes persist in selling them?
      Or why do they still uphold the practice? The answer is: Because
      indulgences have been a source of enormous revenue to the Vatican.
      Although the popes knew there was no warrant whatever in Scripture for
      such practice, they could not resist the temptation to acquire easy money.
      By appealing to the superstitions and fears of the people, high and low,
      they collected large sums. Not only St. Peter’s cathedral, but many other
      projects have been financed in considerable measure by money raised in
      this manner. Papal indulgences are not sold today, but they still are
      granted; and it is understood that “the faithful” who come seeking them
      must not come empty-handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having examined the tenets and practices of the Roman Church as regards
      the matter of individual salvation, we have no hesitation at all in
      branding as false the entire system of penance and indulgences. And that
      for the simple reason that those who trust Christ for salvation are
      justified by faith, not by works. They have no need for penances or
      indulgences from any priest or pope. The superabundant merits of the
      saints, alleged to have been accumulated by those who have done more than
      was required, are purely imaginary. No man can earn his own salvation by
      good works, much less can he have merits left over which can be
      transferred to others. The penances and indulgences which the people
      receive are not only worthless but are clever frauds and are without any
      foundation whatever in the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a system represents God as forgiving sins, yet holding the sinner
      guilty and subjecting him to punishment both here and after death. What an
      arrogant assumption that is on the part of the priests when they presume
      to take charge of and to dispose as their own the merits of the saints,
      and even those of Christ Himself! It is readily apparent what effective
      weapons the assigning of penances and the granting of indulgences really
      are for keeping a spiritually unenlightened people under the power of the
      priesthood.
    </p>

<div id="Assurance" dropdownName="Assurance" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Assurance of Salvation</h2>
    <p>
      The first consequence of the doctrine of penance and indulgences is that
      the Roman Catholic, though baptized and confirmed, can never have that
      assurance of his salvation and that sense of spiritual security which is
      such a great blessing to the Protestant. In proportion as he is
      spiritually sensitive, the person who holds to a works religion knows that
      he has not suffered as much as his sins deserve, and that he can never do
      as much as he should in order to be worthy of salvation. The dying Roman
      Catholic, after he has done all that he can do and after the last rites
      have been given to him, is told that he still must go to purgatory. There
      he will suffer unknown torture, with no assurance as to how long it will
      continue, but with the assurance that if his relatives pay with sufficient
      generosity his suffering will be shortened.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a contrast with all of that is the death of the true believer,
      who has the assurance that he goes straight to heaven into the immediate
      presence of Christ! What a marvelous blessing is the evangelical faith,
      both in life and at the time of death!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent even pronounced a curse upon anyone who presumed to
      say that he had assurance of salvation, or that the whole punishment for
      sin is forgiven along with that sin. Such assurance is pronounced a
      delusion and a result of sinful pride. Rome keeps her subjects in constant
      fear and insecurity. Even at death, after extreme unction has been
      administered and after thousands of rosary prayers have been said “for the
      repose of the soul,” the priest still cannot give assurance of salvation.
      The person is never “good enough,” but must serve in purgatory prison to
      be purified of venial sins before he can be admitted to the celestial
      city. No one can be truly happy without the assurance of salvation; and
      particularly in spiritual matters a state of doubt and uncertainty is a
      state of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple truth, however, is that one can be saved and can be sure that
      he is saved. All he has to do is to trust in the finished work of Christ
      and to receive from Him the gift of eternal life. For His Word declares,
      “He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me hath eternal life
      , and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life”
      (John 5:24). “He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life : but he that
      obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
      him” (John 3:36). The Bible tells us that “the blood Jesus his Son
      cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7), and that to be “absent from the
      body” is to be “at home with the Lord” (2 Corinthians 5:8). Paul expected
      that at his death he would go into the immediate presence of Christ, for
      he wrote to the church in Philippi: “But I am in a strait betwixt the two,
      having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better
      [no purgatory there!]: yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your
      sake” (Philippians 1:23). And in the parable that Jesus gave of the rich
      man and Lazarus, Lazarus was carried by the angels directly from earth to
      Abraham’s bosom (Luke 16:19-31).
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Christ is able to keep His people saved, not because of their
      goodness or faithfulness, both of which are very erratic, but because of
      His power and grace: “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall
      never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father who
      hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch
      them out of the Father’s hand” (John 10:28-29). This eternal life of which
      Christ speaks is a gift (John 3:16); it is made effective by a
      supernatural work of the Holy Spirit in the soul which is called
      “regeneration” (Titus 3:5), or a new birth, a being “born anew” or “from
      above” (John 3:3), and as such it is irrevocable—“for the gifts and the
      calling of God are not repented of’ (Romans 11:29). Nothing less than a
      supernatural act on the part of God (regeneration) can bring a soul from a
      state of spiritual death to a state of spiritual life, and nothing less
      than another supernatural act of God could reverse that condition. This is
      the true “perseverance of the saints”—not that we persevere in holding on
      to God, but that He perseveres in holding on to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus God wants us to be saved, and He wants us to know that we are saved.
      He has told us so in His Word. We have a salvation that is complete, a
      salvation that meets all the needs of the sinner. In Protestantism
      salvation is present, when one accepts Christ as Savior. In Romanism it is
      future, after he has been through purgatory, and only then if he has “good
      works” added to confession, penance, and communion. In Protestantism
      salvation is a matter of grace. In Romanism one must work hard for it and
      must pay dearly for it, and after he has done all that the priest has
      prescribed, he still cannot know whether he has it or not. And through it
      all there stands the anathema of the Council of Trent against all who
      affirm the certainty of their salvation. Hence there is not to be found
      anywhere a consistent Roman Catholic who enjoys the assurance of eternal
      life. Nor can Modernism or Liberalism give that assurance, nor Judaism,
      nor Mohammedanism, nor any of the pagan religions. Evangelical
      Protestantism alone can give that assurance. That was the message of the
      Reformation in the 16 th century when it proclaimed justification by faith
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very curious thing happened in connection with the death of Pope Pius
      XII, in 1958. His personal physician, Dr. Galeazzi-Lisi, shortly afterward
      wrote an article for publication in a Rome newspaper in which he described
      “the agonizing death of Pope Pius XII,” and told of the pope’s fear and
      insecurity regarding the future. But the article met strong disapproval on
      the part of the church authorities. Copies of the newspaper were
      confiscated before they could be distributed, and Dr. Galeazzi-Lisi was
      promptly dismissed from his position. Dr. Walter M. Montano, at that time
      editor of Christian Heritage, recalled that when Pope Benedict XV died in
      1922 a similar report was given of his death, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      “One can feel only a sense of pity for the last end of such a man. How is
      it possible that the ecclesiastical demigod who had the keys of heaven and
      earth is unable to use those keys to gain entrance into his own eternal
      salvation? What a pathetic ending for a man who has devoted his life to
      religion; who has directed, as they say, ‘the barque of St. Peter’; who
      was infallible; who has elevated the Virgin Mary to a state that no other
      pope had dared to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the end of his life he dies in fear and agony, not knowing what the
      future holds in store for him. All the pomp and ceremony, all the
      masterfully devised rituals in his honor may impress the people,
      especially Roman Catholics, but they cannot gain him one inch of heaven.
      And what about his soul and his eternal destiny? What Roman Catholic knows
      where this pope is right now? The doctrine of the Roman Church established
      that anyone who can say ‘I am saved’ at any time in his life commits a
      mortal sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If pope Pius XII had had the courage to express faith in the only One who
      died for our sins; if he had realized that there is only one Mediator
      between man and God; if he had accepted the fact that Christ’s death
      invalidated any other sacrifice and that once for all He died for the sins
      of the world—then pope Pius XII would not have faced a death of fear and
      desperation, an ‘agonizing death.’ Instead, he would have been able to
      say: ‘I know whom I have believed!”’ (issue of December, 1958).
