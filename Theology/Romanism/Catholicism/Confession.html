    <h2>The Nature of the Confessional</h2>
    <p>The Baltimore Catechism defines confession as follows:</p>
    <p>
      “Confession is the telling of our sins to an authorized priest for the
      purpose of obtaining forgiveness.”
    </p>
    <p>It adds:</p>
    <p>
      “An authorized priest is one who has not only the power to forgive sins by
      reason of his ordination to the priesthood, but also the power of
      jurisdiction over the persons who come to him. He has this jurisdiction
      ordinarily from his bishop, or by reason of his office” (p. 315).
    </p>
    <p>
      The important words here are “authorized priest.” And to be genuine a
      confession must be heard, judged, and followed by obedience to the
      authorized priest as he assigns a penance, such as good works, prayers,
      fastings, abstinence from certain pleasures, etc. A penance may be defined
      as a punishment undergone in token of repentance for sin, as assigned by
      the priest—usually a very light penalty.
    </p>
    <p>The New York Catechism says:</p>
    <p>
      “I must tell my sins to the priest so that he will give me absolution. I
      shall go to confession often... to fulfill a condition for gaining certain
      indulgences. ... A person who knowingly keeps back a mortal sin in
      confession commits a dreadful sacrilege, and he must repeat his
      Confession. ... The sacrament of penance remits the mortal sins and their
      eternal punishment; it revives the merits annulled by the mortal sins, and
      gives a special grace to avoid sin in the future.”
    </p>
    <p>The French Catechism goes so far as to say:</p>
    <p>
      “One must receive absolution in feelings of total humility, considering
      the confessor as Jesus Christ Himself whose place he takes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests can scarcely make a greater demand than that! Canon Law 888
      says: “The priest has to remember that in hearing confession he is a
      judge.” Canon Law 870 says: “In the confessional the minister has the
      power to forgive all crimes committed after baptism.” And a book,
      Instructions for Non-Catholics, primarily for use by those who are joining
      the Roman Catholic Church, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The priest does not have to ask God to forgive your sins. The priest
      himself has the power to do so in Christ’s name. Your sins are forgiven by
      the priest the same as if you knelt before Jesus Christ and told them to
      Christ Himself’ (p. 93).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Roman Catholics are required to confess all their mortal sins to a
      priest who sits as a judge and who claims to have the power to forgive
      sins in the name of God. The priest forgives the guilt of mortal sins,
      which saves the penitent from going to hell, but he cannot remit the
      penalty due for those sins and so the penitent must atone for them by the
      performance of good works which he prescribes. Priests, too, including the
      bishops, cardinals, and even the pope, receive forgiveness in this same
      manner, confessing their sins to other priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the language of Romanism a “penitent” is one who confesses to a priest,
      not necessarily one who is repenting of sin, although that is implied; and
      the “confessor” is the priest, not the one who confesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confessional “box” found in all Roman Catholic churches, is divided
      into two compartments. The priest enters one, and the penitent the other.
      In the wooden partition between them is a metal gauze about two feet
      square. The penitent kneels, and through the gauze whispers or speaks in a
      low voice his or her sins. The confession is secret, and is called
      “auricular,” because spoken into the ear of the priest. It supposedly is a
      detailed confession of all the mortal sins committed since the last
      confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The penitent may be, and usually is, interrogated by the priest, so that
      he or she may make a full and proper confession. That, of course, gives
      the priest the opportunity to find out practically anything and everything
      that he may want to know about the person or about community affairs.
      Stress is placed on the fact that any sin not confessed is not forgiven,
      and that the omission of even one sin may invalidate the whole confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of confession is quite interesting. After kneeling before the
      priest and asking and receiving his blessing, the penitent must repeat the
      first part of the Confiteor:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess to the Almighty God, to the blessed Virgin Mary, to blessed
      Michael the Archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy apostles
      Peter and Paul, to all the saints, and to you, father, that I have sinned
      exceedingly, in thought, word, and deed, through my fault, through my
      fault, through my most grievous fault” (latter, repeated three times).
    </p>
    <p>
      The penitent must then confess all his mortal sins, concealing nothing.
      Venial sins, in most instances, may be omitted, since they are
      comparatively mild and may be expiated by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      We notice concerning this form of confession that (1) it places Mary,
      Michael, John the Baptist, Peter, Paul, the Roman saints, and the
      officiating priest on a level with God Almighty; (2) it addresses the
      confession of sin to all of them, as if the sin was committed equally
      against all of them, and as if they were holy beings with power to
      forgive; and (3) it makes no mention whatever of Christ, through whom
      alone pardon is to be had, or of the Holy Spirit, by whom alone the soul
      can be cleansed. And there sits the priest, usurping the place of God and
      forgiving sins! Notice how the penitent is constantly put in a subordinate
      role and at the mercy of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every loyal Roman Catholic is required under pain of mortal sin to go to
      confession at least once a year. The Fourth Lateran Council, 1215, decreed
      that every adult, man or woman, should confess all his or her sins to a
      priest at least once a year. This decree was ratified by the Council of
      Trent, 1546, and remains in force today. More frequent confession is
      advised, particularly if public or heinous sins have been committed. This
      decree has been elaborated and extended by various church laws so that
      considerable pressure rests on the average church member to go to
      confession more often, the preferable time period frequently being set at
      once a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confession is facilitated through “societies,” or “confraternities,” which
      under the guidance of the priest urge their members to confess at least
      once a month. Young women may belong to an organization known as “Children
      of Mary.” Boys and young men have similar organizations, most of which
      have a provision for confession at least once a month. Membership in such
      organizations supposedly is voluntary, but the social pressures may be
      such that one who fails to join is made to feel practically ostracized.
      Hence “voluntary” confessions are fairly frequent and fairly easy to
      secure. Ordinarily a child is required to begin going to confession at the
      age of seven, as though he comes to accountability at that age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical development. We search in vain in the Bible for any word
      supporting the doctrine of auricular confession. It is equally impossible
      to find any authorization or general practice of it during the first one
      thousand years of the Christian era. Not a word is found in the writings
      of the early church fathers about confessing sins to a priest or to anyone
      except God alone. Auricular confession is not mentioned in the writings of
      Augustine, Origen, Nestorius, Tertullian, Jerome, Chrysostom, or
      Athanasius—all of these and many others apparently lived and died without
      ever thinking of going to confession. Those writers give many rules
      concerning the practice and duties of Christian living, but they never say
      a word about going to confession. Never were penitents forced to kneel to
      a priest and reveal to him the secret history of all their evil thoughts,
      desires, and human frailties. No one other than God was thought to be
      worthy to hear confessions and to grant forgiveness. There were, to be
      sure, public confessions before local church groups, in order that
      offenders might be restored to fellowship. Such practice is found even in
      some Protestant groups of our own day. But such confessions were open,
      general, and voluntary, and were as different from auricular confession as
      light is from darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually as the church gained power the practice of seeking spiritual
      counsel and advice from the priest was turned into the confessional.
      Confession was first introduced into the church on a voluntary basis in
      the fifth century, by the authority of Leo the Great. But it was not until
      the Fourth Lateran Council, in 1215, under Pope Innocent III, that private
      auricular confession was made compulsory and all Roman Catholic people
      were required to confess and to seek absolution from a priest at least
      once a year. At that council the twin doctrines of auricular confession
      and transubstantiation were decreed. It will be recalled that that was the
      period of the greatest extension of priestly and papal power over the
      people. It was, therefore, during the darkest days of the state and of the
      church that this masterpiece of deception was brought forth.

    <h2>Mortal and Venial Sins</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman Church divides all sin into two classes, making an important and
      elaborate distinction between so-called “mortal” and “venial” sins. Mortal
      sin is described as “any great offense against the law of God,” and is so
      called because it is deadly, killing the soul and subjecting it to eternal
      punishment. Even after a penitent has received pardon, a large but unknown
      amount of punishment remains to be expiated in purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venial sins, on the other hand, are “small and pardonable offenses against
      God, or our neighbor.” Technically, venial sins need not be confessed
      since they are comparatively light and can be expiated by good works,
      prayers, extreme unction, purgatory, etc. But the priests are not to be
      outdone by this technicality. The terms are quite elastic, and permit
      considerable leeway on the part of those who want to probe more deeply
      into the affairs of the penitent. It is generally advised that it is safer
      to confess supposed venial sins also, since the priest alone is able to
      judge accurately which are mortal and which are venial. The Baltimore
      Catechism (written, of course, by priests) says: “When we have committed
      no mortal sins since our last confession, we should confess our venial
      sins or some sin told in a previous confession for which we are again
      sorry, in order that the priest may give us absolution” (p. 329). What
      chance has a poor sinner against such a system as that?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no agreement among the priests as to which sins are mortal and
      which are venial. But they all proceed on the assumption that such a
      distinction does exist. What is venial according to one may be mortal
      according to another. If the pope were infallible in matters of faith and
      practice, as claimed by the Roman Church, he should be able to settle this
      important matter by accurately cataloging those sins which are mortal as
      distinguished from those which are venial. But such a list no pope has
      ever been able to produce. Instead what they have is an elaborate system
      of compromise which is designed to promote the authority of the church and
      to give a considerable amount of leeway to the priest as to what seems
      expedient in individual cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among mortal sins, however, are those committed in breaking the ten
      commandments, together with the so-called “seven deadly sins”: pride,
      covetousness, lechery (lust, lewdness), anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth.
      Included are practically all sexual offenses, whether in word, thought, or
      deed, and a long list of transgressions down to attending a Protestant
      church, reading a Protestant Bible, eating meat on Friday, or “missing
      mass on Sunday morning” without a good excuse (which means that
      considerably more than half of the claimed Roman Catholic membership
      throughout the world is constantly in mortal sin). Sometimes violations of
      the rules of the church are treated as mortal sins, while transgressions
      of the commandments of God are treated as venial sins. All mortal sins
      must be confessed to the priest in detail or they cannot be forgiven. The
      theory is that the priest must have all the facts in order to know how to
      deal with the case and what penance to assign the real reason, of course,
      is to place the penitent more fully in the hands of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Bible makes no such distinction between mortal and venial sins.
      There is in fact no such thing as venial sin. All sin is mortal. It is
      true that some sins are worse than others. But it is also true that all
      sins, if not forgiven, bring death to the soul, with greater or lesser
      punishment as they may deserve. The Bible simply says: “The wages of sin
      is death” (Romans 6:23)—and there Paul was not speaking of any particular
      kind of sin, but of all sin. Ezekiel says: “The soul that sinneth, it
      shall die” (18:4). When James said, “For whosoever shall keep the whole
      law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all” (2:10), he
      meant, not that the person who commits one sin is guilty of all other
      kinds of sin, but that even one sin unrepented of shuts a person out of
      heaven and subjects him to punishment, just as surely as one puncture of
      the eyeball subjects a person to blindness, or as one misstep by the
      mountain climber plunges him to destruction in the canyon below. In the
      light of these statements, the distinction between mortal and venial sins
      is shown to be arbitrary and absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Shorter Catechism (Presbyterian), in answer to the
      question, “What is sin?” says: “Sin is any lack of conformity unto, or
      transgression of, the law of God” (Question 14). And we are reminded that
      in the Garden of Eden eating the forbidden fruit appeared to be but a very
      trifling offense; yet the consequences were fatal, not only for Adam and
      Eve but for the entire human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanism presents a purely arbitrary classification of sins. The effect of
      that classification is in itself immoral. We know how quick corrupt human
      nature is to grasp at any excuse for sin, and how readily this distinction
      gives license for its commission. Furthermore, we may point out that a
      Roman Catholic who commits mortal sin shortly before his death, but who
      cannot find a priest to whom he can confess, by definition of his church,
      runs the risk of dying in mortal sin. It is so easy to commit mortal sin.
      As just stated, even failure to attend Sunday mass without a good excuse
      is a mortal sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the use of the confessional the priest has been able to pry into
      the conscience of each individual, so that no heretic might escape, and in
      the case of the faithful to gain entrance into the privacy of the domestic
      family circle. There is literally and in truth no area of life that is
      exempt from the scrutiny and supervision of the priest. “Knowledge is
      power,” and that power can be wielded in many ways, to direct people along
      lines that will promote the church program, or for the personal benefit of
      the priest himself. It is perfectly evident that the priest to whom a
      person has confessed his thoughts, desires, and every sinful action just
      as it occurred, has placed that person largely under his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some that means little less than slavery. This is particularly true of
      women and girls who have even destroyed their self-respect in so
      surrendering themselves to the priest. The result is a sense of shame,
      worry, and of being at the mercy of the priest. Through the confessional
      Rome has been able to exercise an effective control not only over the
      family, but over political officials of every grade, teachers, doctors,
      lawyers, employers and employees, and indeed over all who submit to that
      discipline.

<div id="Forgiveness" dropdownName="Forgiveness" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Priests Cannot Forgive Sins</h2>
    <p>
      The Scriptures teach that only God can forgive sins: “Who can forgive sins
      but one, even God?” (Mark 2:7); “...The Son of man hath authority on earth
      to forgive sins” (Matthew 9:6). It is because God is our Creator and Owner
      and Judge, and because it is His law that we have broken, that He can
      forgive sins. The Lord Jesus Christ has this power because He is God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Church of Rome teaches that her priests also can forgive sins, and
      that “They pardon sins, not only as ambassadors of Jesus Christ, but as
      judges, and by way of jurisdiction” (Council of Trent, Sess. 14,9;
      Bellarmine, De Poenit, 3,2). The Council of Trent declares further:
      “Whosoever shall affirm that the priest’s sacramental absolution is not a
      judicial act, but only a ministry to pronounce and declare that the sins
      of the party confessing are forgiven, let him be anathema.” And the
      priest, after hearing the confession says to the penitent: “I absolve you
      from your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
      Ghost. Amen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the priest in the confessional claims not merely a declarative power
      through which the penitent’s sins are pronounced forgiven, but a judicial
      power through which he assigns penances. Unlike the priests of the Old
      Testament who merely declared the leper cleansed from his leprosy, the
      Roman priest actually claims power as a minister of God to forgive sin.
      Though a mere human being, he exalts himself to a position as a necessary
      mediator between God and man, and insists that in his office as confessor
      he be considered as Christ Himself. Auricular confession therefore becomes
      a public act of idolatry in that the penitent bows down before a man, who
      is dependent on him for his living, and asks from him that which God alone
      can give. And on the part of the Roman Church it is the height of sinful
      pride and folly thus to put in the place of God a priest who himself is
      only a man and guilty of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a priest who is in mortal sin still can forgive sin in the
      confessional. Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, after saying that “The Church asks
      that a priest who absolves a penitent be in the state of grace, a
      participant, himself, of the Divine Life,” adds “This does not mean,
      however, that a priest in the state of mortal sin would not possess the
      power to forgive sins or that when exercised it would not be effective for
      the penitent” (Peace of Soul, p. 136; 1949; McGraw Hill Book Co., New
      York).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Zacchello tells of his experience in the confessional before
      conversion to Protestantism in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where my doubts were really troubling me was inside the confessional box.
      People were coming to me, kneeling down in front of me, confessing their
      sins to me. And I, with a sign of the cross, was promising that I had the
      power to forgive their sins. I, a sinner, a man, was taking God’s Place,
      God’s right, and that terrible voice was penetrating me saying, ‘You are
      depriving God of His glory. If sinners want to obtain forgiveness of their
      sins they must go to God and not to you. It is God’s law that they have
      broken, not yours. To God, therefore, they must make confession; and to
      God alone they must pray for forgiveness. No man can forgive sins, but
      Jesus can and does forgive sins.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States the Roman hierarchy is much more reserved in its
      claims than it is in Roman Catholic countries, and the priests often say
      to uninformed people that they do not presume to forgive sins. But that is
      a deliberate falsehood, as is shown by the official decree of the Council
      of Trent, and by the formula of absolution which is, “I absolve thee. Go
      in peace.” The Roman position is that, through the power given to Peter,
      and received from him by apostolic succession, they have the power to
      forgive or to refuse to forgive sins. That was a power claimed by the
      priests of pagan Rome, and it was taken over by the priests of papal Rome.
      Many American Roman Catholics have been enlightened by their contacts with
      Protestantism to the extent that they refuse to believe such claims. But
      where Rome is unopposed the claims are asserted boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Roman system the priest constantly comes between the sinner and
      God. In Father McGuire’s edition of the New Catechism No. 1, with
      imprimatur by Cardinal Spellman, of New York, we read: “You must tell your
      sins to the priest to have them forgiven.” And again, “Confession is
      telling your sins to the priest to obtain forgiveness.” As the penitent
      confesses to the priest and does the penance assigned, there is no direct
      contact with God, but only with the priest. A Roman Catholic does not pray
      to God spontaneously as to one who is a Friend, Comforter, Forgiver. To
      him God is exalted beyond the reach of ordinary mortals, and his contact
      is on a lower level, with the priest, who presents himself as God’s
      representative. The result is that Roman Catholics never really settle the
      sin problem. The only solution they have is in their contact with the
      church; original sin is removed by baptism, and mortal and venial sins are
      confessed to the priest who absolves them in his own right. They may be
      punctual in prayer to God, but only to venerate and adore Him. The priest
      represents God in personal problems. Consequently, they have religion, but
      not the religion of the Bible. Martin Luther says that after becoming a
      priest, which he did primarily as a means of gaining assurance concerning
      his own salvation, he realized, as most priests eventually do, that
      forgiveness of sins in the Catholic confessional had no effect on him and
      that he was just the same after confession as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection Dr. Paul Woolley, Professor of Church History in
      Westminster Theological Seminary, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “People today love authority. In a disordered and uncertain world that may
      blow up in their faces, they have a deep desire to listen to the man who
      knows or the church which knows. The Roman Catholic Church says that it
      knows. But the substitution of the authority of the Roman Church for the
      authority of God is exceedingly dangerous. It results in such phenomena as
      the denial of the freedom of Protestant preaching in Spain and in
      Colombia, in the physical persecution of Protestants in various areas
      where Rome is dominant. This is not the exercise of the authority of God;
      it is the tyrannous perversion of God’s authority by sinful men. It is a
      denial of the New Testament teaching that the Gospel is to be preached by
      spiritual means, that violence cannot bring in the kingdom of God, that
      ‘faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God,’ not by
      imposition from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Catholicism is a refuge for the lazy thinker. The man who wants to be
      told the answers to everything, to be treated like a child, can find what
      he wants in the Roman Church. But God gave His Word to man to read, to
      study, to ponder, to apply. Only under the freedoms of modem Protestantism
      can this be done with a good conscience. These freedoms must be protected
      as of the vital core of our liberties. Rome claims the right not only to
      suppress free preaching but to deny civil liberties in general. Let us not
      barter away these freedoms” (The Presbyterian Guardian , December 15,
      1958).
    </p>
    <p>
      The somber attitude of the confessional cannot be denied. The priest sits
      as judge of the eternal destiny of all who come before him. He may, at his
      own discretion, forgive or withhold forgiveness for every kind and number
      of sins. There are no witnesses to what is said. No record of the
      proceedings is kept. The penitent is merely given a promise that secrecy
      will be observed. For the devout, sincere Roman Catholic salvation depends
      upon his ability to call to mind while in the confessional all of his sins
      and to confess them. It is impressed upon him that only that which is
      confessed can be forgiven. The priest cannot forgive that which he does
      not know about. What spiritual agony that means for many a soul who fears
      he may have omitted some things that should have been told, and that he
      will have to make amends for them in purgatory! And even though he does
      his best, he may, from one confession to another, fall into mortal sin and
      be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, no matter how serious the crime, whether murder,
      robbery, adultery, fraud, etc., no public jail sentence or fine is
      imposed, but instead only a few minutes of prayer, the saying of the
      rosary or of “Hail Mary’s,” and a verbal promise of reform is imposed.
      This secret process of forgiveness and of hiding of crimes may be
      accomplished again and again as long as the sinner conforms to the church
      regulations. A consequence of easy absolution is that many take the moral
      law more lightly and sin more freely just because they know absolution is
      easy to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Church denies that anyone can have assurance of eternal
      life—such assurance, of course, would undermine the confessional itself,
      for the penitent must be made to feel his constant dependence upon the
      priest and the church. But how contrary is such teaching to the word of
      Christ: “Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
      believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life , and cometh not into
      judgment, but hath passed out of death into life” (John 5:24). Here Christ
      clearly teaches that (1) the believer now has eternal life, (2) he does
      not come into judgment, and (3) he has passed from death into life. All
      three of these blessings are given solely on the basis that one has heard
      and believed the promise of Christ. Not a single word is said about
      confession to a priest or about doing penance. And nowhere in the New
      Testament is there any record of forgiveness having been obtained from a
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may well ask: If Roman priests have the apostolic power of binding and
      loosing, of granting or refusing absolution from sin, why do they not also
      possess the ‘power’ to perform miracles which Christ conferred upon the
      apostles? Christ said that it was just as easy to say, “Arise, and walk,”
      as to say, “Thy sins are forgiven” (Matthew 9:5). Why cannot Roman priests
      do the same? The fact is that all men are sinners, all have serious
      defects and faults, and none can exercise the powers of God. Those who
      play God are only acting foolishly.

    <h2>Scripture Teaching Regarding Confession</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that it is the privilege of every penitent sinner to
      confess his sins directly to God: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful
      and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
      unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). What did the Lord Jesus say when He spoke
      of the Pharisee and the publican? The publican had no priest, and he did
      not go to a confessional. All he did was to cry with bowed head, “God, be
      thou merciful to me a sinner.” He went directly to God. And Jesus said
      that he went down to his house justified (Luke 18:9-14). Indeed, why
      should anyone confess his sins to a priest when the Scriptures declare so
      plainly: “There is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself
      man, Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). And yet the priest presumes to say, “I
      absolve you,” “I forgive your sins.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Confession of sins is commanded all through the Bible, but always it is
      confession to God, never to man. It is a striking fact that although Paul,
      Peter, and John dealt frequently with men and women in sin, both in their
      teaching and in their practice, they never permitted a sinner or a saint
      to confess to them. Paul wrote thirteen of the New Testament epistles, and
      in them he often speaks of the duties and practices of Christians. But
      never once does he mention auricular confession. Peter, John, and Jude
      wrote six epistles in which they have much to say about the matter of
      salvation. But not one of them ever mentions auricular confession. And
      certainly Christ never told anyone to go to a priest for forgiveness.
      Nowhere do the Scriptures tell us that God appointed a special class of
      men to hear confessions and to forgive sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such an important tribunal as the confessional had been established,
      undoubtedly the apostles would have commented on it repeatedly. Had the
      power of forgiving sins been committed to the apostles, it would have been
      one of the most important parts of their office and one of the leading
      doctrines of Christianity. We cannot imagine that they would have been so
      remiss as never to have exercised that most important function, and
      nowhere even to have alluded to it. John, for instance, says: “If any man
      sin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” (1
      John 2:1). He does not say that we have a priestly tribunal to which we
      can go and having confessed our sins receive forgiveness. Everywhere
      throughout the Bible the remission of sins and the gaining of salvation is
      connected with faith in Christ. “He that believeth on the Son hath eternal
      life: but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of
      God abideth on him” (John 3:36). ‘‘Being therefore justified by faith, we
      have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” says Paul (Romans
      5:1). Everywhere the exhortation is, “Believe and be saved.” Nowhere are
      we told to seek the absolution of a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement of James, “Confess therefore your sins one to another, and
      pray one for another, that ye may be healed” (5:16), and that in Acts
      19:18, “Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and
      declaring their deeds,” alleged by Roman Catholics to support their
      position, do not teach private confession to a priest, but are rather
      proof against it since they imply the duty of the priest to confess to the
      layman as well as for the layman to confess to the priest. These
      statements properly mean, “Confess your faults, your shortcomings, to your
      fellow Christians who have been injured by you.” They mean that when one
      has wronged his neighbor he should acknowledge his fault and make
      restitution. Paul used the word “sin” in this sense when he said: “Neither
      against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar,
      have I sinned at all” (Acts 25:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Public confession was practiced in the early church on occasions, as it
      now is in some Protestant churches when members wish to give a testimony
      of their lives. But secret auricular confession to a priest, with the
      priest privileged to draw out the individual and probe for details, to
      pronounce a judgment upon him and assign a penance, is an entirely
      different thing. The Bible does not require us to parade our sins before a
      priest or before the congregation, but only to confess to God. In any
      event, for one sinner to confess his sins to another sinner to obtain
      forgiveness is degrading and demoralizing, and, more than that, it is
      dishonoring to God.

    <h2>Alleged Roman Catholic Scripture Proof</h2>
    <p>
      In defense of the confessional the priests depend primarily on the two
      following Scripture references:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou
      shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt
      loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matthew 16:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      “He therefore said to them, ‘Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, I
      also send you.’ When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to
      them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are
      forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained” (John
      20:21-23, Confraternity Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chapter on Peter, and the section dealing with the “Keys,” we have
      discussed the meaning of Matthew 16:19, and have pointed out that the
      power given to the apostles was symbolical and declarative, and that it
      related to the authority given to them to preach the Gospel, which
      contains God’s conditions for repentance and forgiveness. “Repentance and
      remission of sins” was to be “preached in his name unto all the nations”
      (Luke 24:47). “To him (Christ) bear all the prophets witness, that through
      his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins”
      (Acts 10:43). And again, “Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that
      through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: and by him
      every one that believeth is justified from all things” (Acts 13:38-39).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ often used figurative language, as when He said, “The scribes and
      Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat: all things therefore whatsoever they bid
      you, these do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say,
      and do not” (Matthew 23:2-3); and, “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
      hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye
      enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to
      enter” (Matthew 23:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The scribes and Pharisees were in possession of the law. In that sense
      they sat on Moses’ seat. As the law was faithfully given to the people, or
      withheld from them, the way to heaven was opened before them, or closed to
      them. In the failure of the scribes and Pharisees to give the law to the
      people they were shutting the kingdom of heaven against men, not
      literally, but figuratively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The keys of the kingdom” was a symbolic expression for the Old Testament
      Scriptures which set forth the way of salvation. The Old Testament, of
      course, was the only Scripture they had at that time. It was the
      responsibility of the scribes and Pharisees, who were the custodians of
      the Scriptures, to acquaint the people with that knowledge by making the
      Scripture truth available to them. But instead, they not only neglected
      that duty but actually veiled the Scriptures and perverted their meaning
      so that the people who wanted that knowledge were deprived of it.
      Similarly, in the Christian dispensation, the apostles were given “the
      keys of the kingdom,” not a set of metallic keys, of course, and not that
      they could by a mere word admit certain individuals into the kingdom while
      excluding others, but that, in the words of Paul, they were “intrusted
      with the Gospel” (1 Thessalonians 2:4), and so opened or closed the
      kingdom as they proclaimed the Word of Life or withheld it. In that sense
      every minister today, and indeed every Christian, who teaches the Word
      also possesses the “keys” and admits to, or excludes from, the kingdom.
      The key to the kingdom is the Gospel of Christ. Peter was given that key,
      and he used it to unlock the kingdom to those to whom he preached. We have
      that same key, and we must use it in the same way, by making known the
      message of salvation and so opening up to others the way into the kingdom
      of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The powers of binding or loosing, and of forgiving or retaining sins, were
      given to the apostles as proclaimers of the Word of God, not as priests.
      As we have shown elsewhere, there are no Christian “priests” in the New
      Testament dispensation. The apostles never claimed the power of forgiving
      sins by absolution as Roman priests do. Rather they preached the Gospel of
      salvation through Christ—which was a declarative power, by which they
      announced the gracious terms on which salvation was granted to sinful men.
    </p>
    <p>As Dr. Woods has said:</p>
    <p>
      “These expressions indicate a declarative power only: the right to
      proclaim in Christ’s name and with His authority, that all who truly
      repent of sin and trust in Him for pardon and salvation, shall surely be
      forgiven and saved. But it is Christ alone, and not the minister, who
      forgives. According to Scripture, the minister is only a herald to
      announce what the King will do, on condition of repentance and faith on
      the part of the sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This was the teaching of the apostles, and of the early church before the
      papal party corrupted it; for Tertullian in the third century declared
      that all Christians have, like Peter, the power of the keys, to proclaim
      forgiveness and salvation through Christ. And this has always been the
      doctrine of the Reformed Church of all branches” ( Our Priceless Heritage,
      p. 118).
    </p>
    <p>
      That this is the true meaning of Matthew 16:19 and John 20:21-23 is clear
      from the practice and preaching of the apostles. They always directed
      sinners to Christ. Never once did any apostle say, “I absolve you,” or,
      “Your sins are forgiven.” Instead, we read that when Peter entered the
      home of the Roman centurion, Cornelius, and this man “fell down at his
      feet, and worshipped him,” Peter “raised him up, saying, Stand up; I
      myself also am a man” (Acts 10:25-28). And when the people of Lystra
      attempted to confer divine honors upon Paul and Barnabas, these two
      Christian missionaries promptly stopped such procedure, saying, “We also
      are men of like passions with you” (Acts 14:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Language similar to that spoken to the Apostles was addressed to the
      prophet Jeremiah. We read: “And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put
      my words in thy mouth: see I have this day set thee over the nations and
      over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to
      overthrow, to build and to plant” (1:9-10). But Jeremiah never literally
      plucked up, or broke down or destroyed, or planted nations and kingdoms.
      His mission was to declare to the nations the terms on which God would
      build up or destroy, or reward or punish nations. His was declarative, not
      executive, power. Similarly, Peter and the other apostles were given
      authority to declare the terms on which God would save His people and
      forgive their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly obvious that the teaching of these verses regarding the
      forgiving or retaining of sins, and the binding or loosing, are not
      intended to contradict the clear teaching of the rest of the Bible on this
      subject, which states explicitly that only God has the power to forgive
      sin. If we read carefully Matthew’s account, for instance, we find that
      the context deals with disciplinary problems in a load church. The
      immediately preceding verses, 15-17, read: “And if thy brother sin against
      thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee,
      thou hast gained thy brother. But if he hear thee not, take with thee one
      or two more, that at the word of two witnesses or three every word may be
      established. And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and
      if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile
      and the publican.” Then follows the statement: “Verily I say unto you,
      What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and
      what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have a case in which a difference develops between two believers.
      This passage tells us how such a difference is to be settled. If our
      Christian brother has sinned, it is our duty first to go to him and tell
      him about it. If he hears us and mends his ways, well and good. But if he
      does not hear us, then we are to go back to him, taking one or two
      Christian brothers with us. If that is unsuccessful, then we are to bring
      the matter before the local congregation. If he refuses to heed the
      admonitions of the church, i.e., the whole assembly of believers, then we
      are to treat him as a Gentile and a publican, as no longer a member of the
      congregation. In this manner disciplinary action is to be exercised, not
      secretly by a priest, but openly by the collective decision of the local
      church, the elders of course leading as they do in all other functions of
      the local church. If their efforts prove futile, then the “sin” of this
      member is to be “bound,” that is, the offender is to be officially charged
      with it, pronounced guilty, and expelled from the membership. But if he is
      found innocent, he is to be “loosed” from the sin, that is, acquitted of
      the charge of which he was accused. In this sense, and in this sense only,
      not a priest, nor an elder, but the local congregation is to exercise
      discipline. And Christ has promised to honor such action in His church, so
      long as it is done in a Christian manner under the guidance of the Holy
      Spirit—what they bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and what they
      loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

  <section>
    <h2>Abuses of the Confessional</h2>
    <p>
      If the confessional has no sanction in Scripture, how did it come to be
      established in the church? Let Dr. Woods answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because its establishment was greatly to the interest of the hierarchy.
      The confessional enormously increased the power of the pope and the
      clergy. The priests came to know the secrets of men from the emperor down
      to the humblest peasant, and all classes of society were thus placed in
      the power of their religious leaders, whom they did not dare to disobey or
      offend. Not only were the sins and scandals of each individual’s life and
      that of families laid bare, but all the intrigues of State, the political
      schemes of the rulers of Europe, were in the possession of the confessor,
      who could use his knowledge for the advancement of the church, or to help
      a political party in which he was interested. What greater intellectual
      and moral bondage for human beings could be imagined, or what more
      dangerous power could be possessed, than that of the Roman confessional?
      History furnishes many impressive warnings; see Charles IX and the
      massacre of St. Bartholomew; or of Louis XIV and the cruel revocation of
      the Edict of Nantes, 1685” (Our Priceless Heritage , p. 129).
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen again to the testimony of Lucien Vinet, who for years operated the
      confessional and who knows the Roman system well:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Roman Catholic, says his church, must, in order to obtain peace with
      God, declare all his sinful actions, omissions and his most secret
      thoughts and desires, specifying minutely the kinds of sins committed, the
      number of times and all the circumstances that might alter the gravity of
      a sin. A murderer is obliged to declare his crimes, a young girl her most
      intimate thoughts and desires. We have seen men tremble, women faint and
      children cry when the time to confess their sins to us had come. A priest
      cannot hear confessions for many months before he realizes that this
      ordeal cannot be requested by the kind and merciful Lord. On the other
      hand we have seen priests laugh and joke in referring to their embarrassed
      penitents. Confession is a usurpation of authority by priests who
      investigate the minds and souls of human beings. When an organization such
      as the Roman system can control not only the education, the family and
      policies of the civil government of its members, but even their very
      thoughts and desires, we do not wonder that it can prosper and succeed.
      Roman Catholics, whether they feel that they ought to admit it or not, are
      forced into submission to Romanism through the process of torturing
      auricular confession.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Vinet then gives the following specific examples of the abuse of the
      confessional:
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) “ Confession of a Child. The child may be only seven years of age. He
      has been told that he must tell all his sins to the priest. If he does
      not, he will commit a sacrilege and should he die, he cannot go to heaven.
      He is naturally very confused as to what really constitutes sin. He is
      naturally shy and reluctant to tell what he has done or thought. The
      result is that he omits to declare certain things that are really not
      sinful but he thinks they are. His conscience will reproach him for having
      hidden a sin in confession and he cannot make peace with his God.
      Confession has ruined the soul of many a child. How different is all this
      from the words of Christ who said, ‘Suffer the little children to come
      unto me’!
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) “ Confession of a Young Girl. We now have a shy Roman Catholic young
      girl, passing through the state of childhood to puberty, who is about to
      enter the confessional. She is naturally embarrassed and her state of mind
      is just what a sordid confessor wishes to explore. The priest will now
      hear from a young woman the most secret thoughts and desires of her soul.
      Her mind and soul are sacrificed on the altar of Romanism. Many
      embarrassing questions are asked according to the sins accused. ... These
      shameful details of a confession are mentioned here to illustrate what is
      meant by the torture of confession. Roman Catholics know very well that
      what we disclose is the crude truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) “Confession of a Married Woman. A married woman enters the
      confessional. She will tell a strange man secrets which she probably would
      not dare to reveal to her husband. She is even bound to reveal certain
      secrets of her husband. In the Roman Church birth control of all varieties
      is a sin and must be confessed with all its circumstances. The husband
      might be of Protestant faith and his Roman Catholic wife will have to
      disclose to the priest the most intimate relations of their marital life.
      The priest will know more about the wife than the husband. There are no
      family secrets because Rome has required that hearts and souls shall be
      fully explored by priests. In this manner Romanism controls the whole
      intimate lives of married couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A married woman, who has any amount of natural discretion and honesty,
      will enter the confessional with apprehension and often despair. She fears
      that terrible infallible questionnaire. It is impossible to describe the
      mental inconvenience she now experiences by the spectre of compulsory
      confession. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Roman Catholic women! We know well that your kind souls are tortured
      to death by this terrible Roman obligation of telling, not only your sins,
      but also the most intimate secrets of your married life. As an ex-priest
      we can tell you that these mental tortures imposed upon your souls are not
      a prescription of the Saviour of mankind to obtain forgiveness of your
      sins, but are pure inventions of men to keep your minds and hearts under
      the control of a system, the torturous Roman religious organization. We
      must admit that as a priest we had no power to forgive your sins. No
      priest has such powers” (/ Was a Priest, pp. 62-67).
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Charles Chiniquy, after spending twenty-five years as a Roman
      Catholic priest in Canada and the United States, renounced the Roman
      Church and the priesthood and in the following paragraphs expressed his
      sense of humiliation and shame at having ever engaged in the processes of
      the confessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With a blush on my face, and regret in my heart, I confess before God and
      man, that I have been through the confessional plunged for twenty-five
      years in that bottomless sea of iniquity, in which the blind priests of
      Rome have to swim day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had to leam by heart the infamous questions which the Church of Rome
      forces every priest to learn. I had to put these impure, immoral questions
      to women and girls who were confessing their sins to me. Those questions,
      and the answers they elicit, are so debasing that only a man who has lost
      every sense of shame can put them to any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I was bound in conscience, to put into the ears, the mind, the
      imagination the memory, the heart and soul of women and girls, questions
      of such a nature, the direct and immediate tendency of which is to fill
      the minds and hearts of both priests and penitents with thoughts and
      temptations of such a degrading nature, that I do not know any words
      adequate to express them. Pagan antiquity has never seen any institution
      more polluting than the confessional. I have lived twenty-five years in
      the atmosphere of the confessional. I was degraded and polluted by the
      confessional just as all the priests of Rome are. It has required the
      whole blood of the great Victim, who died on Calvary for sinners, to
      purify me” (The Priest, the Woman, and the Confessional, pp. 67-68).

      This book by Charles Chiniquy is, we believe, the best available dealing
      with all phases of the confessional, and should be read by everyone who
      would have a clear understanding of the evils involved in that
      institution. It describes conditions which existed in Montreal and in
      other parts of Canada in the middle 19 th century, and shows the depths to
      which the confessional tends if unrestrained by evangelical forces.

      Such testimonies as we have cited make it clear that the confessional is
      contaminating alike to the penitent and to the priest. The great ornament
      of the woman is modesty and purity. But when a woman is taught that
      modesty and restraint in the confessional are in themselves sins, womanly
      virtue is bound to suffer. Most of the priests are educated, trained,
      clever men, who know how and to what extent they can safely ply their
      penitents. Appropriate here are the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      Vice is a monster of such hideous mien,
      <br />
      As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;
      <br />
      But seen too oft, familiar with her face,
      <br />
      We soon approve, admire, and then embrace.

      Husbands and fathers are not ordinarily asked such questions as are put to
      girls and women in the confessional, and it is not an unusual thing when
      they become enlightened as to what conversations are carried on between
      the priests and their wives and daughters that they absolutely forbid them
      to go to confession. The unfortunate thing, however, is that even after
      they become enlightened concerning this phase of Romanism, they usually
      remain in that church and continue to try to fulfill all of the other
      requirements, despite the fact that failure to comply with the regulations
      concerning the confessional is in itself a mortal sin.

      Another who grew up in the Roman Catholic Church describes the
      confessional and its effect on the people in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The confessional is a system of espionage—a system of slavery. The priest
      is the spy in every home. Many Catholics are shocked by the character of
      the questions put to them. A Catholic woman said to a Protestant friend,
      ‘I would rather take a whipping any day than go to confession.’ One can
      readily understand why most Catholics are timid and afraid of the priest
      and are obedient to the letter of his wishes because they know that
      through the confessional the priest has secured a knowledge of their
      habits and life that no one else knows anything about. The average priest
      can stride along with that lofty air. When he meets his parishioners he
      often tosses his head as though he were a demigod. Why is it? Because he
      holds the secrets of the personal lives of all his flock—of all who trust
      him” (John Carrara, Romanism Under the Searchlight, p. 70).
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the rules of the Roman Church the priest is forbidden to reveal
      anything told him in the confessional. This is known as the “seal of the
      confessional.” Otherwise the practice of confession could not be
      maintained. But under certain circumstances he can pass on information
      gained: (1) with the consent of the penitent, which for the priest often
      times is not hard to obtain; (2) anything revealed apart from the
      confession itself, that is, in further conversation, can be passed on; (3)
      among themselves priests often discuss information gained in the
      confessional without mentioning names, and so stay within the limits of
      Canon Law; and (4) if a dispute arises as to whether or not permission was
      granted, the word of the priest is to be accepted in preference to that of
      the penitent. And, as the clergy are not permitted to tell what transpires
      in the confessional, so neither are those who confess permitted to repeat
      anything, since they too are a part of the church system. This, then,
      gives the priests an ideal situation for the secret direction of the
      personal affairs of their parishioners, including their family life,
      community affairs, voting, or the management of any political machines
      directed by them or political offices held by them.

      The assertion of the priests that the confessional brings peace to the
      soul is cruel sarcasm. In most cases the result is exactly the opposite,
      and the penitents remain a certain period of time, sometimes longer,
      sometimes shorter, in a distressed state of mind. For the honest,
      conscientious person, young or old, the fear of not making “a good
      confession,” of omitting or inaccurately reporting the various
      experiences, and so making the entire confession null and void, is in
      itself a tormenting worry. Believing that their salvation depends, as the
      priest tells them that it does, on a full and truthful recounting of all
      their sinful actions, those honest souls fear that they have not been
      sufficiently contrite, or that they have withheld some necessary details.
      Women in particular dislike the confessional, and usually restrict
      themselves to what they must say.

      The Roman Catholic people pay dearly for this invention as they submit
      themselves to its discipline. Much depends, of course, upon the individual
      priest. Some are truly considerate of the sensitivities of their people
      and refrain from unreasonable probing, while others abuse the privilege.
      In any event, every priest knows that he proffers what is flagrantly false
      every time he dismisses his penitent with the benediction: “Go in peace,
      thy sins are forgiven thee.” For Protestants the confessional is
      undoubtedly the most revolting feature of the Roman system. Fortunately,
      in the United States, where Protestantism is the predominant religion, the
      abuses of the confessional do not reach such depths as in the Roman
      Catholic countries. Why is it, for instance, that the Roman Catholics of
      Southern Ireland are so inferior to their Protestant neighbors in Northern
      Ireland? Why so much poverty, ignorance, superstition, and immorality?
      Nearly a century ago Charles Chiniquy wrote concerning the Roman Catholic
      nations of his day:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The principal cause of the degradation of Ireland is the enslavement of
      the Irish women by means of the confessional. After the Irish woman has
      been enslaved and degraded, she, in turn, has enslaved and degraded her
      husband and sons. Ireland will be an object of pity; she will be poor,
      miserable, degraded, as long as she rejects Christ and is ruled by the
      father confessor.”
    </p>
    <p>He added:</p>
    <p>
      “The downfall of woman in France, and her degradation through the
      confessional, is now an accomplished fact, which nobody can deny; the
      highest intellectuals have seen and confessed it. Why is it that Spain is
      so miserable, so weak, so poor, so foolishly and cruelly reddening her
      fair valleys with the blood of her children? The principal, if not the
      only cause of the downfall of that great nation is the confessional.
      There, also the confessor has defiled, degraded, enslaved women, and women
      in turn have defiled and degraded their husbands and sons” (The Priest,
      the Woman, and the Confessional, p. 6466 ).
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the comparative status of Roman Catholic and Protestant
      nations, it is a fact that every Roman Catholic nation in the world today
      is bankrupt, and that every Roman Catholic nation in the world today is
      looking to Protestant United States for financial and economic aid in one
      form or another. The Protestant nations of Europe—England, Scotland,
      Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and northern Germany—have been far more
      enlightened and progressive than have their Roman Catholic neighbors. This
      is not mere chance, but a consistent pattern that has been in evidence
      since the days of the Reformation. Surely the facts speak for themselves.
      Someone has said: “Every Protestant nation is superior to every Roman
      Catholic nation.” We believe that is true.

      According to a decree of the Council of Trent it is not necessary, in
      order to obtain pardon in the confessional, that the sinner be sorry
      because his sin was an offense against God, but only that he be sorry for
      fear that unless he confesses before a priest and receives forgiveness he
      will go to hell forever. The decree reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is sufficient if he is sorry for fear of otherwise burning in hell for
      all eternity” (Sess. 14, C. H.).
    </p>
    <p>Commenting on this phase of the confessional Dr. Zacchello says:</p>
    <p>
      “Anyone can understand that this practice of the Catholic confession is no
      deterrent to crime, and can easily, in fact, be made an excuse for
      continuing in it. Big-time criminals and racketeers generally can find
      ways to circumvent the civil law and its penalties. If they are Roman
      Catholics and believe in confession, they have assurance of an easy way of
      also escaping punishment in the next life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Examples are plentiful of such big-time Catholic criminals and racketeers
      continuing in crime without any qualms of conscience. ‘Big Tom’ Pendergast
      of Kansas City who died after release from federal penitentiary was one of
      them. Under his rule Kansas City was a menace to the morals of young and
      old. Brothels flourished openly and criminal gangs enforced his edicts.
      Gambling houses were commonplace, and he himself was the biggest gambler
      of his age. Political corruption abounded and Pendergast, as the boss of
      it all, grew fabulously rich from the wealth that flowed into his pockets
      from this underworld traffic in crime. Yet, when he died on January 26,
      1945, Monsignor Thomas B. McDonald who preached his funeral sermon after
      solemn high mass, publicly proclaimed him ‘a man with a noble heart and a
      true friend,’ because ‘he went to mass every morning at 7:30 for 30 years.
      ’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tom Pendergast did not fear the penalties of the civil law, because he
      could escape them by bribing and corrupting judges and officers of the law
      whom he himself had appointed. He was assured by his church’s teaching
      that he could also escape God’s punishment as long as he went to
      confession regularly, told his crimes to the priest and said he was sorry
      merely because he was afraid of going to hell. He was assured that he
      could continue his life of crime with impunity as long as he made sure of
      having a priest to absolve him before he died and to say masses afterward
      for his soul in purgatory. ... We former priests now know what true
      forgiveness of sins means in Christian teaching; that God alone forgives
      sin and with forgiveness comes a complete change of life. The Catholic
      practice of confession is merely a recital to a man of sins committed,
      with no guarantee of pardon from God, and nothing to prevent the
      repetition of the same sins over and over again” (,Secrets of Romanism,
      pp. 123-125).

      What a fraudulent, dishonest, futile, and unscriptural practice the
      operation of the confessional really is!
