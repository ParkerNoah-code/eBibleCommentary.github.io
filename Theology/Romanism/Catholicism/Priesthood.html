    <h2>The Office of the Priest</h2>
    <p>
      The office or work of the priest is perhaps the most difficult to present
      and the least understood of any part of the Christian system. In the Old
      Testament the work of Christ was prefigured under the three offices of
      prophet, priest, and king. Each of these was given special prominence in
      the nation of Israel. Each was designed to set forth a particular phase of
      the work of the coming Redeemer, and each was filled, not by men who
      voluntarily took the work upon themselves, but only by those who were
      divinely called to the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophet was appointed to be God’s spokesman to the people, revealing
      to them his will and purpose for their salvation. The priest was appointed
      to represent the people before God, to offer sacrifices for them and to
      intercede with God on their behalf. And the king was appointed to rule
      over the people, to defend them and to restrain and conquer all His and
      their enemies. In the present study we are concerned only with the
      priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essential idea of a priest is that of a mediator between God and man.
      In his fallen estate man is a sinner, guilty before God, and alienated
      from Him. He has no right of approach to God, nor does he have the
      ability, or even the desire, to approach Him. Instead, he wants to flee
      from God, and to have nothing to do with Him. He is, therefore, helpless
      until someone undertakes to act as his representative before God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ancient Israel the priests performed three primary duties: they
      ministered at the sanctuary before God, offering sacrifices to Him in
      behalf of the people; they taught the people the law of God; and they
      inquired for the people concerning the divine will. Under the old covenant
      the men who held the offices of prophet, priest, or king were only shadows
      or types of the great Prophet, the great Priest, and the great King who
      was to come. With the coming of Christ each of these offices found its
      fulfillment in Him. And with the accomplishment of His work of redemption,
      each of these offices, as it functioned on the human level, reached its
      fulfillment and was abolished. As regards the priesthood Christ alone is
      now our Priest, our one and only High Priest. He fulfills that office in
      that He once offered up Himself a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice,
      thereby making unnecessary and putting an end to all other sacrifices. He
      paid the debt for the sin of His people, and so opened the way for renewed
      fellowship between them and God. And as the risen and exalted Savior of
      His people. He intercedes effectually for them with God the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this is clearly set forth by the writer of the Epistle to the
      Hebrews who in the ninth chapter says that “Christ having come a high
      priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect
      tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation, nor
      yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood,
      entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal
      redemption” (vv. 1112); that we are redeemed through “the blood of Christ,
      who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God”
      (v. 14); that “Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like
      in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the
      face of God for us” (v. 24); that “now once at the end of the ages hath he
      been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself’ (v. 26); and
      in 8:1-2, that “We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand
      of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary,
      and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus under the figure of Israel’s sacrificing priesthood, particularly
      through the figure of the high priest who entered into the holy of holies
      on the day of atonement with blood that had been offered, we are shown
      that Christ, who is our High Priest, has entered into the heavenly
      sanctuary with the merits of His atoning sacrifice, that its atoning and
      cleansing power may be constantly applied to all who put their trust in
      Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with this New Testament change in the priesthood, through
      which the old order of ritual and sacrifice which prefigured the atoning
      work of Christ has been fulfilled and Christ alone has become our true
      High Priest, the human priesthood as a distinct and separate order of men
      has fulfilled its function and has been abolished. Furthermore, all
      bom-again believers, having now been given the right of access to God
      through Christ their Savior, and being able to go directly to God in
      prayer and so to intercede for themselves and others, themselves become
      priests of God. For these are the functions of a priest. This we term the
      universal priesthood of believers. And this is the distinctive feature of
      Protestantism as regards the doctrine of the priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ye also,” says Peter, “as living stones, are built up a spiritual house,
      to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
      God through Jesus Christ. ... Ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a
      holy nation, a people for God’s own possession” (1 Peter 2:5,9). In making
      that statement Peter was not addressing a priestly caste, but all true
      believers , as is shown by the fact that his epistle was addressed to
      Jewish Christians who were scattered throughout the various nations,
      “sojourners of the Dispersion” (1:1), even to those who are as “newborn
      babes” in the faith (2:2). And in Revelation 1:5-6, John, writing to the
      seven churches in Asia Minor, says: “Unto him that loveth us, and loosed
      us from our sins by his blood: and he made us to be a kingdom, to be
      priests unto his God and Father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifices offered by the Christian in the exercise of this priesthood
      are, of course, not for sin, as professedly are those of the Roman
      Catholic mass. Christ offered the true and only sacrifice for sin, once
      for all. His sacrifice was perfect. When He had completed His work of
      redemption upon the cross and was ready to give up His spirit He said, “It
      is finished” (John 19:30). With His sacrifice God was fully satisfied. It
      therefore does not need to be repeated, nor supplemented, nor modified in
      any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifices offered by the Christian are termed “spiritual,” and they
      relate to worship and service. First, there is the sacrifice of praise:
      “Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God
      continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession in his name”
      (Hebrews 13:15). This offering of thanks and praise to God in worship,
      which expresses the gratitude of the heart, is an acceptable offering.
      Second, there is the sacrifice offered through our gifts, as our substance
      is given for the support of God’s work. He has declared that it is His
      pleasure to receive such gifts when they are given willingly and with pure
      motives: “But to do good and to communicate forget not [i.e., sharing with
      others, helping those who are in need]; for with such sacrifices God is
      well pleased” (Hebrews 13:16). And third, there is the offering of
      ourselves, our bodies, our lives, in Christian service: “I beseech YOU
      therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a
      living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual
      service” (Romans 12:1). Furthermore, we are sons of God through faith in
      Christ (1 John 3:1-2). As no longer servants but sons in His family, we
      have direct access to Him as our Father and no longer need the mediation
      of any order of human priests. To depend upon priestly mediation is by
      that much to return to Judaism and to introduce an dement of apostasy into
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the New Testament sets forth a new and different kind of priesthood:
      first, Christ, the true High Priest, who is in heaven; and second, the
      universal priesthood of believers, through which they offer the
      “spiritual” sacrifices of praise, of gifts, and of themselves in Christian
      service. It thereby repudiates the pretentious claims of the Roman
      priesthood, which would perpetuate the Jewish priesthood and limit it to a
      few chosen men who are set apart from the laity, who profess to offer
      literal sacrifices in the mass, and who supposedly are nearer to God than
      are other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every believer now has the inexpressibly high privilege of going directly
      to God in prayer, without the mediation of any earthly priest, and of
      interceding for himself and for others. We are told: “Ask, and it shall be
      given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
      unto you” (Matthew 7:7); “If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will
      give it you in my name” (John 16:23); “Whosoever shall call on the name of
      the Lord shall be saved” (Acts 2:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      The believer, of course, approaches God not in his own merits but only
      through the merits of Christ who has made a perfect sacrifice for him. It
      is precisely at this point that the Roman Catholic fails to see God’s true
      way of salvation, for he thinks that man still must approach God as in Old
      Testament times through a priest, or now perhaps through Mary or some
      saint whose merits can work for him. But Paul says, “By grace have ye been
      saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God"
      (Ephesians 2:8). Christians have, by virtue of their union with Christ,
      free access to God at all times. This right is one of the finest things in
      the Christian faith, and it is a present possession. Yet Rome would rob us
      of this privilege and would interpose her priests and dead saints between
      the soul and God. Rome’s teaching and practice is heresy, for in many
      places the Bible invites us to come to God through Christ, without any
      reference to priests or other intercessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that “There is one God, and one mediator between God and
      men, the man Jesus Christ” (1 Timothy 2:5). The Church of Rome teaches
      that there are many mediators—the priests, Mary, a host of saints, and the
      angels—and that it is right and proper to pray to them. But to any honest
      priest in the Church of Rome it must become more and more apparent that
      Christ is the only true Priest, the only true Mediator, and that in
      serving as a priest, in pretending to offer the sacrifice of the mass and
      to forgive sins, he is merely acting the part of an impostor.

    <h2>No New Testament Authority for a Human Priesthood</h2>
    <p>
      The really decisive answer to all theories concerning a human priesthood
      is found in the New Testament itself. There we are taught that the
      priesthood, along with the other elements of the old dispensation,
      including the sacrificial system, the ritual, the Levitical law, the
      temple, etc., has served its purpose and has passed away. With the coming
      of Christ and the accomplishment of redemption through His work, the
      entire Old Testament legalistic and ritualistic system which had
      prefigured it became obsolete and passed away as a unit. It is very
      inconsistent for the Roman Church to retain the priesthood while
      discarding the other elements of that system.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enlightening article that appeared in the Chicago Lutheran Theological
      Seminary Record, July, 1952, somewhat abbreviated has this to say about
      the priesthood:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The writers of the New Testament had two separate words for elder and
      priest. They do not mean the same thing at all, and the New Testament
      never confuses them. It never says presbuteros, elder, when it means
      priest. The New Testament word for priest is hiereus. In Greek, from Homer
      down, this word had a singular meaning. It meant a man appointed, or
      consecrated, or otherwise endowed with power to perform certain technical
      functions of ritual worship, especially to offer acceptable sacrifices,
      and to make effectual prayers. Likewise in the Septuagint hiereus is the
      regular if not invariable translation of the Old Testament kohen and
      kahen, the only Hebrew word for priest. It occurs more than 400 times in
      the Old Testament in this sense. In the New Testament hiereus always means
      priest, never means elder. There is not anywhere in the New Testament the
      shadow of an allusion to a Christian priest in the ordinary sense of the
      word, that is, a man qualified as over against others not qualified for
      the special function of offering sacrifices, making priestly
      intercessions, or performing any other act which only a priest can
      perform. The Epistle to the Hebrews attributed both priesthood and
      high-priesthood to Christ and to Him alone. The argument of the Epistle
      not only indicates that a Christian priesthood was unknown to the writer,
      but that such a priesthood is unallowable. It is to Jesus only that
      Christians look as to a priest. He has performed perfectly and permanently
      the function of a priest for all believers. His priesthood, being perfect
      and eternal, renders a continuous human priesthood both needless and
      anachronistic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul enumerates the different kinds of ministers and agents in the
      Christian church, and the office of priest is not among them: “And he gave
      some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,
      pastors and teachers” (Ephesians 4:11). And again, “And God hath set some
      in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers. ...”
      (1 Corinthians 12:28). There is never any mention of priests. The only
      mediatorial priesthood recognized in the New Testament is that of Christ,
      the great High Priest, and to Him alone is the title “priest” ( hiereus )
      given: “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek”
      (Hebrews 7:17); “But he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood
      unchangeable. Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that
      draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
      for them. For such a high priest became us, holy, guiltless, undefiled,
      separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; who needeth not
      daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own
      sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all ,
      when he offered up himself’ (Hebrews 7:24-27), “For by one offering he
      hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the priesthood occupied such an important place in the Old Testament
      dispensation and in the thinking of the Jewish people, it is inconceivable
      that, had it been continued in the New Testament dispensation, God would
      have made no mention of it at all—how priests were to be chosen, and
      ordained, and how they were to carry out their functions in this radically
      different dispensation. The fact of the matter is that the Old Testament
      priesthood was the human, Aaronistic priesthood, and that by its very
      nature it was, like the sacrificial system and the elaborate temple
      worship of which it was a part, a temporary affair, a mere shadow and
      prefigurement of the reality that was to come. And so, with the coming of
      Christ and the establishment of His priesthood, it fell away, as the stars
      fade before the rising sun, and as the petals fall away before the
      developing fruit. The priesthood as an order of clergy has been abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Epistle to the Hebrews several chapters are devoted to showing that
      the Old Testament priesthood has been abolished and that there is no place
      in Christianity for a sacrificing priesthood, because Christ, “through his
      own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained
      eternal redemption,” and that He has offered “ one sacrifice for sins for
      ever ’ (9:12, 10:12). The many human priests with their innumerable animal
      sacrifices were effective in their work of reconciling the people to God
      only because they represented the true High Priest and the one true
      sacrifice that was to come. But after the reality appeared, there would be
      no more need for the shadows and types that had preceded it. Hence we read
      concerning the sacrifice of Christ: “But now once at the end of the ages
      hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself’
      (Hebrews 9:26); and again: “We have been sanctified through the offering
      of the body of Christ once for all” (Hebrews 10:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifice of Christ was therefore a “once-for-all” sacrifice which
      only He could make, and which cannot be repeated. By its very nature it
      was final and complete. It was a work of Deity, and so cannot be repeated
      by man any more than can the work of creation. By that one sacrifice the
      utmost demands of God’s justice were fully and forever satisfied. Final
      atonement has been accomplished! No further order of priests is needed to
      offer additional sacrifices or to perpetuate that one. His was the one
      sacrifice to end all sacrifices. Let all men now look to that one
      sacrifice on Calvary! Any continuing priesthood and any “unbloody
      repetition of the mass,” which professes to offer the same sacrifice that
      Christ offered on Calvary, is in reality merely a sham and a recrudescence
      of Judaism within the Christian Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abolition of the priestly caste which through the old dispensation
      stood between God and man was dramatically illustrated at the very moment
      that Christ died on the cross. When He cried, “It is finished,” a strange
      sound filled the temple as the veil that separated the sanctuary from the
      holy of holies was torn from top to bottom. The ministering priests found
      themselves gazing at the tom veil with wondering eyes, for God’s own hand
      had removed the curtain and had opened the way into the holy of holies,
      symbolizing by that act that no longer did man have to approach Him
      through the mediation of a priest, but that the way of access to Him is
      now open to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the veil which had been torn by the hand of God was patched up again
      by priestly hands, and for forty years, until the fall of Jerusalem,
      sacrifices continued to be offered in a restored temple service, and in
      Judaism the veil continued to stand between God and men. In our day the
      Roman priesthood has again patched up the veil. Through the use of
      spurious sacraments, the sacrifice of the mass, the confessional,
      indulgences, and other such priestly instruments it insists on keeping in
      place the curtain that God Himself has removed. It continues to place
      fallible human priests, the Virgin Mary and dead saints as mediators
      between the sinner and God, although the Bible declares most clearly that
      “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, himself man,
      Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the continuing priesthood in the Church of Rome is absolutely
      unscriptural and unchristian. It owes its existence solely to a man-made
      development that can be traced in detail in the history of the church, for
      it was not until the third or fourth century that priests began to appear
      in the church. That system has been a source of untold evil. But papal
      dominance has been built upon that practice and is dependent on its
      continuance. Without a hierarchical priesthood the papal system would
      immediately disintegrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle Peter, far from making himself a priest or a pope, was content
      to call himself one of the many elders, a presbuteros. And he specifically
      warned the elders against that most glaring error of the Roman Catholic
      priests, lording it over the charge allotted to them. He urged rather that
      they serve as examples to the flock: “The elders therefore among you I
      exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
      who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Tend the flock
      of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint,
      but willingly, according to the will of God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but
      of a ready mind; neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you,
      but making yourselves ensamples to the flock” (1 Peter 5:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards priestly innovations that have been made by the Roman Church,
      Dr. R. Laird Harris, Professor of Old Testament in Covenant Theological
      Seminary, in St. Louis, writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “First century Christianity had no priests. The New Testament nowhere uses
      the word to describe a leader in Christian service. The Jewish priesthood
      was changed, we are told in Hebrews 7:12. Christ is now our ‘priest
      forever after the order of Melchizedek’ (Hebrews 7:17). It is true that
      the Douay but not the Confraternity version does use the word ‘priest’ (in
      a Christian connection), but the Greek never uses the word ‘hiereus’
      (priest), nor does the Latin so use ‘sacerdos’ (priest). It is good that
      this clear mistranslation of the Douay has been corrected in the newer
      Roman Catholic Confraternity edition. Christian priests are a Roman
      Catholic invention” (booklet, Fundamental Protestant Doctrines , II, P-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctrine of the universal priesthood of believers is not merely a
      negative teaching abolishing an order of clergy. For along with that
      freedom which makes the believer responsible only to God for his faith and
      life, there is an added responsibility. We are members of a Christian
      community, “an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for
      God’s own possession” (1 Peter 2:9). As Christians, then, we are not
      “laymen,” not mere spectators of the Christian enterprise who may or may
      not engage in it as we choose, but “priests,” and therefore responsible to
      God for the faith and lives of others. We are under obligation to make
      known this message of salvation. The word “layman” is not found in the New
      Testament, nor is there any “layman’s movement” in the Bible. A priest is
      inevitably involved in the lives of others, and is responsible to God for
      others. He has the high privilege and duty of making God known to others.
      This priesthood, therefore, applies to all believers, and consists of two
      things: (1) Immediate access to God in prayer for one’s self, and (2) the
      right and duty of intercession for others. Only as we grasp these ideas
      can we appreciate the full, rich meaning of the doctrine of the universal
      priesthood of believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we are a royal priesthood. That means that we have been
      called, chosen, by the King of Kings to be His priests before our fellow
      men. We are not first of all clergy and laymen. We are first of all a
      royal priesthood, under obligation individually to make known the message
      of salvation. And the strength of Protestantism lies precisely here, in
      the willingness of its people to accept this strange office and all that
      it means, and to serve in the household of God as the royal priests that
      we really are.

    <h2>Claims of the Roman Priesthood</h2>
    <p>
      The Council of Trent, whose decrees must be accepted by all Roman
      Catholics under pain of mortal sin or excommunication, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The priest is the man of God, the minister of God. ... He that despiseth
      the priest despiseth God; he that hears him hears God. The priest remits
      sins as God, and that which he calls his body at the altar is adored as
      God by himself and by the congregation. ... It is clear that their
      function is such that none greater can be conceived. Wherefore they are
      justly called not only angels, but also God, holding as they do among us
      the power and authority of the immortal God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a similar vein a Roman Catholic book, carrying the imprimatur of the
      Archbishop of Ottawa, Canada, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without the priest the death and passion of our Lord would be of no avail
      to us. See the power of the priest! By one word from his lips he changes a
      piece of bread into a God! A greater fact than the creation of a world. If
      I were to meet a priest and an angel, I would salute the priest more
      saluting the angel. The priest holds the place of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To millions of Christians who are outside the Roman Church such words
      border on blasphemy, if indeed they are not blasphemy. Surely such
      declarations are a usurpation of the power that belongs only to God.
    </p>

      It is surprising how little Scripture authority even the Roman Church
      cites as a basis for her doctrine of the priesthood. Her main and almost
      only support is found in two verses, Matthew 16:18-19—which she has
      misinterpreted, and then, by adding one human tradition to another, has
      built up an elaborate system which not only has no real support in
      Scripture but which actually is contrary to Scripture. And by teaching her
      people this one interpretation and denying them the right to read or hear
      any other, she has misled millions so that they have come to believe that
      this is true Christianity. These verses read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
      church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will
      give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind
      on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on earth
      shall be loosed in heaven” (Confraternity Version).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various interpretations of these verses. Suffice it to say here
      that this passage contains symbolical language and that the interpretation
      of the “rock,” the “keys,” the “gates of hell,” and the “binding” and
      “loosing” adopted by Rome is by no means the only one, nor even the most
      plausible one. We shall treat these verses more fully in connection with
      the discussion of Peter as the alleged head of the church on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is probably no other doctrine revealed in Scripture that the Roman
      Church has so obviously turned upside down as that of the priesthood. The
      function of no New Testament minister or official resembled that of a
      priest of the Roman Church. The titles of “archbishop,” “cardinal”
      (“prince of the church,” as they like to be called), and “pope” are not
      even in the Bible. The term “bishop” (overseer, or shepherd of the flock)
      designated an entirely different office than does that term in the present
      day Roman Church. In fact the terms “bishop” ( episcopos ) and “elder”
      (presbyteros) were used interchangeably. Elders could be of two kinds—what
      we term the teaching elder, or pastor, and the ruling elder, who
      represented the congregation in the general affairs of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul ordained elders in the newly established churches and gave his
      assistants, Timothy and Titus, instructions for choosing and ordaining
      elders in every city (1 Timothy 3:2, Titus 1:5). During the Middle Ages
      the teaching elder became a priest at the altar, and the function of the
      ruling elder was usurped by bishops, cardinals, and the pope, until
      practically no authority was left in the hands of the congregation, which
      of course is the condition that continues in the Roman Catholic churches
      of today. Rome has robbed the laity of nearly all of its privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ intended that His church, which consists of all true believers,
      should enjoy all of the rights and privileges that were conferred by Him.
      But Rome withdraws those rights and privileges from the people, and
      invests them in an order of priesthood. Christ bade His followers practice
      humility, acknowledge one another as equals, and serve one another
      (Matthew 20:25-28, 23:8; 1 Peter 5:3, 2 Corinthians 4:5). But Rome denies
      this equality and sets up the priest as a dictator belonging to a sacred
      order, altogether apart from and superior to the people of the parish. The
      loyal Roman Catholic must heed what the priest says, for priestly dignity
      is above all. The priest dictates to his people concerning their church,
      school, marriage, children, family affairs, political activities, what
      literature they should read, and so on, all of which he may inquire into
      intimately in the confessional. From before birth until after death that
      influence continues. As father confessor and “director of conscience,” and
      as God’s spokesman to the people, his word is not to be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling of fear and dread of the priest, so characteristic of the
      people in Romanist lands, is comparable only to the fear and dread that
      pagan people have for the witch doctor. Says one from Southern Ireland who
      has had ample opportunity to observe from within the workings of that
      system: “You who have never been under this influence, who have from
      childhood been allowed freedom of speech, liberty of conscience, and who
      see no distinction between your clergy and laity, you cannot, you never
      will understand the influence that Roman Catholic priests have over the
      laity of their own nationality” (Margaret Shepherd, My Life in the Convent
      , p. 46).
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanism puts the priest between the Christian believer and the knowledge
      of God as revealed in the Scriptures, and makes him the sole interpreter
      of truth. It puts the priest between the confession of sins and the
      forgiveness of sins. It carries this interposition through to the last
      hour, in which the priest, in the sacrament of extreme unction, stands
      between the soul and eternity, and even after death the release of the
      soul from purgatory and its entrance into heavenly joy is still dependent
      on the priest’s prayers which must be paid for by relatives or friends.
      The Roman priests, in designating themselves, the Virgin Mary, and the
      saints as mediators, and in making membership in their church the
      indispensable requirement for salvation, place a screen between God and
      the people. And where does Christ come in, in this system? If you search
      you will find Him in the background, behind the priest, behind the Virgin,
      behind the church. The inevitable result is that the spiritual life of the
      Roman Catholic is weak and anemic, and that Roman Catholic countries, such
      as Spain, Italy, Southern Ireland, Quebec, and Latin America, are immersed
      in spiritual darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what the moral character of a priest, his prayers and his
      ministrations are declared to be valid and efficacious because he is in
      holy orders. The Council of Trent has declared that “Even those priests
      who are living in mortal sin exercise the same function of forgiving sins
      as ministers of Christ”—such a declaration was necessary at that time, in
      the middle of the 16 th century, if the Roman Church was to continue to
      function at all, because of the general and well-known immorality of the
      priests. Just as the medicine given by the doctor is supposed to cure the
      patient regardless of the moral character of the doctor, so the priest’s
      official acts are supposed to be valid and efficacious regardless of his
      personal character. He is accounted a “good priest” so long as he remains
      loyal to the church and the rituals and ceremonies performed by him are
      correct. Says one writer, “When you see the way the system of the
      priesthood works out in daily life, be glad you are a Protestant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Few Protestants realize the nature and significance of the vast chasm
      which separates the Roman Catholic priesthood from the people. No such
      gulf exists between the Protestant clergyman and his congregation. A
      fiction of sacerdotal wisdom and holiness, particularly as displayed in
      the sacrifice of the mass, sets the priest apart from the awed and
      reverent Catholic laity. Yet the Roman Church seeks to have the world
      believe that a close unity exists between the clergy and the laity. And an
      almost total ignorance on the part of the Catholic people concerning the
      political machinations of the hierarchy leaves them usually not only
      willing but even proud to be identified with whatever program is put forth
      in the name of the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our method of choosing a minister, which we believe is in harmony with
      the teaching of Scripture and the practice of the early church, we choose
      a man not because he is of a superior order, but because of our belief
      that he is capable of ministering the things of the Spirit to his fellow
      men and because we believe he will live an honest, humble, sincere, and
      upright life. Ordinarily the minister marries and dwells in a family
      because this is the natural state of man, and hence he is closer to his
      people than is the celibate priest. He is chosen by the people, not,
      however, to govern according to the will of the people, but according to
      the will of Christ as revealed in the Scriptures. He is among the flock as
      a spiritual leader, friend, and counsellor, not to be ministered unto, but
      to minister.

    <h2>The Christian Ministry not a Sacrificing Ministry</h2>
    <p>
      We have said that it is the work of a priest to represent man before God,
      to offer sacrifices, to intercede for men, and so to make God propitious,
      that is, favorably inclined toward them. In all pre-Christian religions,
      Judaism included, there were two common elements: (1) a human priesthood
      and (2) the teaching that the salvation provided was incomplete. In the
      very nature of the case their sacrifices were of limited value and
      therefore deficient. In the pagan religions this usually led to belief in
      a future round of existence after death wherein the still unsaved sinner
      would have to make further expiation for his sins. In Judaism it was shown
      in the never-ending cycle of those sacrifices as day after day the same
      ritual was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Roman Catholicism, although it professes to be Christian, possesses
      those same two elements. It claims a human priesthood, and it teaches that
      salvation in this life is not complete, but that after death the soul must
      suffer a longer or shorter time in purgatory and that repeated masses must
      be said to pay the debt for sin. But Protestantism teaches that with the
      coming of Christ and the completion of His work on Calvary a new element
      was added, one which completely eliminates the other two, namely, the
      evangel, or the “good news” that because Christ was both God and man His
      sacrifice was of infinite value, and that it was therefore complete,
      efficacious, and final.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the clear teaching of the Epistle to the Hebrews, for there we
      read:
    </p>
    <p>
      “By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
      Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest indeed standeth day by day
      ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can
      never take away sins: but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins
      for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; henceforth expecting till his
      enemies be made the footstool of his feet. For by one offering he hath
      perfected for ever them that are sanctified” (10:10-14).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “[Christ] who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up
      sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people:
      for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself’ (7:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are taught, first of all, that the pre-Christian element of an
      incomplete salvation was superseded by the complete salvation obtained
      through the one efficacious sacrifice offered by Christ, and, secondly,
      that the human priesthood offering daily sacrifices for the sins of men
      was eliminated, having been done away through the once for all sacrifice
      for sins when Christ offered up Himself. This means further that sin
      cannot persist as something to be expiated for after death; that we are
      saved completely, not half-saved; and that therefore there can be no such
      place as purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Jewish priesthood, (1) there were many priests, (2) they were men
      of infirmity, and (3) it was necessary that they repeat their sacrifices
      many times, for their own sins and for those of the people. These same
      reasons apply with equal force against the Roman priesthood: (1) they too
      are many, (2) they too are men of infirmity, and (3) they too repeat their
      sacrifices many times for themselves and for the people. In the nature of
      the case there could be nothing permanent about the work of the Jewish
      priesthood, for it was merely a foreshadowing or a prefiguring of the work
      that was to be accomplished by Christ. But the “one sacrifice,” offered
      “once for all,” by Christ paid the penalty for the sin of His people and
      so fulfilled the ritual and made all further sacrifices unnecessary. There
      is, therefore, no place for a sacrificing priesthood in the Christian
      dispensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same truth is taught when we are told that after Christ had completed
      His work, He “sat down” on the right hand of God, thus symbolizing that
      His work was finished, that nothing more needed to be added. In Hebrews
      1:3 we read: “Who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of
      his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he
      had made purification for sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
      on high”; and in Hebrews 10:12-13: “But he, when he had offered one
      sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God,
      thenceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatness and completeness and finality of Christ’s sacrificial work
      is seen in His royal rest. The fact that He has sat down is of special
      interest since in the tabernacle and the temple there were no seats or
      benches on which the priests could ever sit down or rest. Their work was
      never done. Their sacrifices had to be repeated daily because there was no
      saving power in them. Therefore their task was endless. But the work of
      Christ was entirely different. His sacrifice of Himself was “once for
      all.” By that one sacrifice He made perfect provision both for the sinner
      and for the sin. Therefore, as our High Priest, He sat down in the place
      of authority, and is now waiting until His enemies are brought into
      subjection and His kingdom is brought to fruition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to notice that when Christ sent out His apostles He
      commanded them to preach and teach, but that He said not one word about
      sacrifice. In the Great Commission He said: “Go ye therefore, and make
      disciples of all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them...” (Matthew
      28:19-20). Yet the most prominent feature of the Roman priesthood is its
      sacerdotal or sacrificial character. The mass is the very heart of the
      service. In the first part of the ordination service for a priest he is
      addressed as follows: “Receive thou the power to offer sacrifices to God,
      and to celebrate masses, both for the living and for the dead. In the name
      of the Lord. Amen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Book of Acts there are many references to the founding of churches,
      preaching the Word, the assembling of Christians, the governing of the
      churches, and the matter of controversies with those who advocate error.
      But there are no references whatever to a sacrificing priesthood. Paul
      likewise through his epistles gave many directions concerning the duties
      of the ministry. But nowhere is there even a hint that the ministers were
      to offer sacrifices, nowhere even an allusion to the mass! The Greek word
      for priest, hiereus, as we have noted, is never applied to New Testament
      ministers. Strange indeed, if this was the work of the early ministers,
      that in Scripture we find no references whatever to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But in contrast with this, in later ages, after the Roman Catholic Church
      had developed, we find the writings of the spokesmen for the church filled
      with references to the mass— how, when, how often, and under what
      circumstances it is to be administered. It became, during the Middle Ages,
      as it is today, the most distinctive feature of the Roman worship, the
      primary thing that they profess to do. Surely it is clear that the
      sacrifice of the mass is a later development, a radical perversion, and
      that the Roman Catholic priesthood is following a system quite foreign to
      that of the early church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Roman Catholics who have turned to Protestantism have said that
      before they left the Roman Church the charges which hurt them most were
      those which declared that the Bible does not reveal a teaching authority
      with the pope and the priesthood as its divinely authorized agents, and
      that the blessed sacrament of the altar does not exist in the New
      Testament. But with further investigation they were forced to conclude
      that such was the case and that in truth the sole support of the
      priesthood was nothing other than the traditions of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conclusion concerning the priesthood must be that Christ alone is our
      true High Priest, the only Mediator between God and men, the reality
      toward which the entire Old Testament ritual and sacrifice and priesthood
      looked forward, and that when He completed His work that entire system
      fell away. Consequently, we reject all merely human and earthly priests,
      whether in the Roman Catholic Church or in heathen religions, and look
      upon their continued practice as simply an attempt to usurp divine
      authority.

    <h2>Training for the Priesthood</h2>
    <p>
      There are approximately 56,540 Roman Catholic priests in the United
      States. And there are 237 bishops, archbishops, and cardinals who make up
      the American hierarchy, according to The Official Catholic Directory (May,
      1963). The large proportion of the priests, some 34,465, are what are
      termed diocesan priests, whose work is in the local churches, while the
      remainder, some 22,075, are in the various religious orders, such as the
      Franciscan, Dominican, Benedictine, and Jesuit. Those in the various
      orders tend to specialize in some specific work, e.g., the Franciscans
      dedicating themselves to the relief of suffering and want, the Dominicans
      to theological and ministerial studies, the Benedictines to service in the
      schools and churches, and the Jesuits to the field of education, although
      the various fields overlap considerably. There are about 35,000 Jesuits in
      the world, some 8,000 of whom are in the United States. There are also
      about 177,000 nuns in the United States who work primarily in the schools
      and hospitals, although some are cloistered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people find it difficult to understand why so many young people
      choose to dedicate themselves for life to the rigorous system of the Roman
      Catholic Church as priests and nuns. The answer is that most of them do
      not enter as a result of free personal choice, but are recruited while
      quite young, usually between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, with
      greater or lesser degrees of leading or persuasion by the priests who are
      instructed to keep their eyes open for promising boys and girls. The
      confessional, which affords the priests an opportunity to know intimately
      the personalities, ambitions, and problems of the young people, affords an
      excellent opportunity for such leading. The church seeks candidates for
      its personnel and tries to gain their commitment at that period in the
      lives of boys and girls when spiritual ideals are strongest but illusive
      and superficial. That is the age when the ambitions of youth soar highest
      and when they feel the urge for selfsacrifice in building a better world.
      The ones the church wants are, for the most part, selected by the priests,
      cultivated over a period of time, sometimes even for years, and so led
      into the various fields of service, although the priests are by no means
      successful in getting all they want. The result is that many a boy and
      girl who had never felt any natural inclination toward the priesthood or
      convent life has found himself or herself following that road and more or
      less committed to it before realizing the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of those who eventually enter the priesthood are recruited from the
      middle or lower class families, boys who for the most part would not have
      much chance for higher education or for advancement in life, and to whom
      ordination means promotion to a position of prestige which their family
      status would not likely attain for them. Training is for the most part
      provided without cost. In their new positions, with their handsome
      rectories, luxurious vestments and beautiful automobiles they can feel
      superior to their parishioners. Those become most beholden to the
      hierarchy for the advantages that they have received, and are the most
      easily controlled. Having been drilled and disciplined into the system,
      they feel powerless to change. This is especially true of those who come
      from orphanages, whether priests or nuns. They are the real victims of the
      system. That is an unhealthy situation and deeply unjust, but one that is
      difficult to control or remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A former English priest, Joseph McCabe, in his book, The Popes and Their
      Church , says that the Jesuits and Benedictines, who control large
      schools, appeal more to the middle class, but that as a rule they fail to
      secure the more intelligent of their pupils, that the intellectual and
      moral level of priests is not nearly as high as, for instance, that of
      teachers and doctors, and that only a minority have any exceptional
      ability or deep religious feeling. Other writers have said substantially
      the same thing. Furthermore, the idea has been promoted among Roman
      Catholics that it is a special honor to have in one’s family a priest or
      nun, and unusual privileges and favors, sometimes quite substantial, are
      directed by the church toward the families of those so chosen. Getting
      into the service of the Roman Church is not so difficult; getting out
      after one has committed himself or herself is the real problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand why Roman Catholic priests act as they do, and why
      the priesthood is able to hold them so firmly, it is necessary to know
      something about the training they receive. That has been set forth clearly
      by Mr. McLoughlin, and we present in considerable detail the account of
      his training in St. Anthony’s Seminary, at Santa Barbara, California,
      which he informs us was during the years 1922-27. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When a boy enters a seminary, he begins twelve years of the most thorough
      and effective intellectual indoctrination the world has ever known. It
      begins gently, with a blending of the legitimate pleasures of boyhood, the
      stimulus of competition in studies, and the pageantry of the forms of an
      ancient religion unseen in an ordinary parish church. It ends twelve years
      later, with a mental rigidity and acceptance of medieval superstitions and
      religious concepts as archaic as those of the Buddhist monks upon the
      isolated, frozen mountains of Tibet. It may surprise non-Catholic
      Americans to leam that the story of Tibet in Lowell Thomas’ On Top of the
      World has its counterpart in the hundreds of Roman Catholic seminaries
      flourishing in the cities and countrysides of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The course of training for the priesthood is roughly divided into two
      periods. The first six years are spent in the junior seminary—four years
      of high school and two years of what would be considered college work. The
      senior seminary provides the last college years, devoted mainly to
      Catholic philosophy, plus four years of training in all the intricacies of
      Catholic theology. Between the junior and senior seminaries in religious
      orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, Vincentians), there comes a year devoted
      entirely to religious indoctrination. This is the novitiate. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “All our textbooks, even in high school courses, were written by Catholic
      authors. No daily newspapers were permitted, and no non-Catholic
      magazines. All incoming mail was opened by the Prefect of discipline, a
      priest; if he deemed advisable, the letters were confiscated. All outgoing
      mail had to be placed in the Prefect’s office in unsealed envelopes. Along
      with newspapers and movies, radios were forbidden for the use of junior
      seminarians. The priests in their supervised recreation hall were
      permitted a radio—but we were not admitted to that hall. Not only were we
      gradually withdrawn from the world but we grew to feel that the
      non-Catholic public disliked us and, if given opportunity, would persecute
      us. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “During these junior years, the boy has no official ties binding him to
      the Church. He may leave the seminary at any time, without penalty. Many
      boys do so; and others are dismissed as being too worldly or
      intellectually unqualified for the intense indoctrination ahead. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “With one magnificent gesture, the ceremony of entering the novitiate
      sweeps aside the centuries. The aspirant for the priesthood in the
      Franciscan Order finds himself, in spirit, walking the ancient streets of
      Assisi, eating in its hallowed monastic halls, and chanting the
      sixth-century hymns of Gregory the Great. ... To symbolize more
      effectively the repudiation of the ‘old’ man and the start of a ‘new’
      spiritual life, even our names were changed. I had been christened John
      Patrick. I was now named Emmett—or, in Latin, Emmatus—in memory of an
      obscure saint in early Irish and French history. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “During this year our seclusion from American life and our indoctrination
      in the ‘spirit’ of the Catholic Church became so intensive that I came to
      feel that I alone was a true Christian, privileged to commune with God. I
      believed that the American way of life was pagan and sinful, a rebirth of
      the Roman Empire and destined to the same disgraceful doom in the ashes of
      history. I came to believe that the American government was to be
      tolerated though wrong—tolerated because it gives unlimited freedom to the
      Roman Catholic Church, wrong because it gives freedom to other churches. I
      believed the ideal form of government was the one in which I was living in
      the seclusion of my spirit—the era when the papacy made kings because the
      power to govern came from God to the king through his ‘representative,’
      the pope. My boyhood concept of civics—of the right of man to the
      processes of law and government through the consent of the governed—faded
      away under the constant repetition of the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and
      the moral theologians. The Constitution of my country and the laws of its
      states dimmed into trivialities in comparison with the all-powerful Canon
      Law of the Roman Catholic Church. I became in all truth a citizen of the
      Church, living—by accident—in the United States.

      “Such intensive indoctrination was unknown to the Western world outside
      the Roman Catholic Church until it was copied by Fascism, Nazism, and
      Communism. The training for the priesthood goes on, after the novitiate
      year, for six more years. We were no longer permitted to visit our homes,
      even for vacations, unless a death occurred in our families. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The process of indoctrination in all seminaries is intensified by the use
      of the Latin language. All textbooks of Catholic philosophy and theology
      are in Latin. The lectures by professors (at least in my day) were in
      Latin. Examinations were conducted in Latin. We reached the point where we
      were thinking in Latin, the language of the early centuries of
      Christianity. Subconsciously we were living not in the age of presidents
      and politicians, or labor unions and capitalists, but in the age of
      masters and slaves, of kings and serfs, of popes, representing God, and
      the faithful, who meekly acquiesced in their decisions as coming from the
      throne of God Himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The chains with which the religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church
      bind their priestly aspirants to a lifetime of service are the three vows
      of obedience, poverty, and chastity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The vow of obedience is the most important of the three. It identifies
      all ecclesiastical superiors with the Church, and it identifies the Roman
      Catholic Church with God. Every command by the superior of a religious
      community or by a church pastor, no matter how petulant, how ill-advised,
      or how unjust, must be considered as a command from God Himself and must
      be obeyed as such under penalty of sin. ...

      “The robe of every Franciscan monk is girded with a rope. One strand hangs
      from his side. It has three knots on it symbolizing the three
      vows—poverty, chastity, and (the bottom knot) obedience. The young
      Franciscan is trained that when the Provincial Superior greets him he must
      kneel on one knee and kiss the lowest knot on the Superior’s cord, and
      then his hand. It is the token of complete, abject, unreasoning obedience.

      “The student priest must leam to crush the desire of the flesh by fasting,
      self-denial, and even physical pain. Many Americans have read of the
      ascetics and hermits of the early middle ages of Christianity who
      mortified the flesh by wearing hair shirts, fastening chains about their
      waists, and sleeping on boards or in bare coffins. But it might surprise
      these Americans to know that in the senior seminaries for Franciscan
      priests in the United States there hangs, inside the door of every cell or
      bedroom, a scourge or whip. It is made of several strands of heavy cord,
      each knotted at the end. Each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening at
      5:45 o’clock we closed the doors of our cells; to the chant of the
      ‘miserere’ we disrobed and ‘scourged our flesh to bring it into
      submission.’ The Superior patrolled the corridors to listen to the sound
      of beating—the assurance of compliance. ...

      “The distinction between the licit and the illicit was so elusive in our
      minds that we could not discern it. We were warned constantly about the
      danger of any association with women. The saints had characterized them as
      tools of the devil, devils themselves in beautiful forms, instruments
      permitted by God to exist and test man’s virtue of chastity” ( People’s
      Padre , pp. 7-18).

    <p>At the conclusion of the book Mr. McFoughlin says:</p>
    <p>
      “To non-Catholic America, I have attempted to portray life within the
      priesthood as it actually is. I have emphasized the long, narrow,
      effective mental indoctrination of the seminary, taking young boys from
      their families, walling them off from society, from world events, from
      modem education through the formative years of adolescence, and then
      turning them out into the ‘vineyard’ after ordination as thoroughly
      dedicated as a Russian envoy to the United Nations. I have pictured the
      tyranny of fear that chains these men to their religious posts long after
      they have become disillusioned and yearn for the freedom and normal life
      of America. I have tried to show, through my own experience and through
      correspondence, the miasmic fog which the Church has intentionally spread
      to conceal the truth from the Roman Catholics who blindly follow
      it—stifling their freedom of thought, of worship, of action, and of life
      itself. I contend that this foreign thing is far more subtle, far less
      forthright, but just as inimical to the American concept of life as
      Communism itself. It is often the indirect cause of Communism by keeping
      whole nations in ignorance and poverty and by developing techniques of
      fear, indoctrination, and mental tyranny that the Kremlin exploits. The
      Inquisition led by the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century finds its
      parallel in the political persecution by the Communists in Czechoslovakia,
      Poland, and Russia” (p. 279).
    </p>
    <p>
      We urge everyone who possibly can to read this very informative and
      interesting book by Mr. McLoughlin. It is written in a truly Christian
      spirit by one who knows intimately the Roman Catholic Church, written not
      in spite, or hatred, or vindictiveness, but to acquaint Roman Catholics
      themselves with the truth concerning the secret inner workings of their
      hierarchy, and to inform those outside the Roman Church concerning the
      nature of this growth that has spread so luxuriously in our free and
      hospitable land while at the same time choking freedom of thought and
      action in those lands which it controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should add that the priestly course of preparation reaches its climax
      in a colorful and solemn ordination ceremony, in which the bishop
      pronounces the awesome words: “Thou art a priest forever, according to the
      order of Melchizedek.” To himself and to the Roman Catholic world the
      young priest becomes an alter Christus , “another Christ,” offering in the
      mass the same sacrifice that Christ offered on the cross. People bow
      before him and kiss his hands as a token of respect and submission.
      Ordinarily a priest is not ordained before the age of 24, although
      ordination can be performed earlier by special permission. According to
      Canon Law, a priest once ordained can never lose his ordination. Even if
      he leaves the Roman Catholic Church, renounces it, and becomes a
      Protestant minister, he still remains a priest, although unable to
      function as a priest until be returns and repents.

    <h2>Groups Within the Priesthood and Within the Laity</h2>
    <p>
      After the new recruits have finished their long course of preparation and
      are ordained as priests, what is their reaction to the environment in
      which they find themselves? Dee Smith, a former Roman Catholic layman who
      writes with an intimate knowledge of conditions within the Roman Church,
      finds that when they emerge from the seminary they gradually evolve into
      three fairly distinct groups which may be classified as: (1) the naive,
      (2) the disillusioned, and (3) the aggressive. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. “The naive are worthy souls so honest themselves that they never
      question the honesty of others. Even repeated experiences of hypocrisy and
      corruption among their priestly brothers are insufficient to shake their
      faith or extinguish their inexhaustible charity. Such priests never
      advance to high rank among the clergy. They are found in poor city
      parishes, lonely country stations, or out in the mission field, sharing
      the meager life of their parishioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. “What of the disillusioned? Emmett McLoughlin estimates that about 17
      percent of the priests would like to leave not only the priesthood but
      also the church. ... Not all who leave have the stamina to stay with it.
      The memory of indolent, well-padded living is too beguiling. Expecting the
      same thing, plus adulation, in the Protestant camp and not finding it,
      these feeble characters inevitably return to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In their eagerness not to jeopardize their cushy sinecure a second time
      they cravenly accept the hypocritical ‘penances’ handed out to them and
      become the most ardent of Rome’s propagandists. Nevertheless it would be
      unfair to judge harshly all disillusioned priests who fail to break with
      Rome. When one considers the scurrilous attacks which will be made upon
      them in the Roman Catholic press, the boycott pressures which will starve
      them out of a means of livelihood, the malignant persecution which will
      seek them out and hound them wherever they go, one can readily understand
      that the decision to leave is a more heroic one than most of us are ever
      called upon to make. It cannot be denied that some of these priests are
      good men who, to atone for their lack of courage, do what they can to
      comfort, encourage, and assuage the lot of the duped and betrayed Catholic
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. “Nothing, however, can be said in extenuation of the aggressive cohort
      of the priesthood, the class which comprises the hierarchy and upper
      clergy as well as many of the lower. No man can rise very high in the
      ranks of the Roman Catholic priesthood unless he is of this class. In
      fact, the savagery of their intolerance against all who stand in the way
      of ruthless ambition extends far beyond their hatred of their tacit
      opponent, the non-Catholic world, and intimately permeates their own
      relationships. The viciousness of their tactics against one another in the
      competition for promotion is precisely the same quality as that of
      medieval cardinals who hired prisoners and assassins to dispose of their
      rivals in the Consistory.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Their objective is not merely a life of privilege, luxury, and carnal
      self-indulgence. In fact, there are among them men of rigid ascetic
      character. But each and every man of them is driven by an insatiable lust
      for power. Each sees himself as a factor to be reckoned with in a
      globe-dominating force. Having lost the capacity for love, they seek the
      fear of their fellow men—the more abject the headier. Is it any wonder
      that the hierarchy’s own security demands an impassable gulf between the
      decent, well-meaning Catholic people and these men with the hearts and
      spiritual nature of wolves, these men with no God but Greed, no religion
      but Power?” (Christian Heritage , May, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief victims of the Roman Catholic system are the people themselves,
      who are schooled to accept the teachings of their church implicitly and
      who are almost totally ignorant of the political machinations of their
      clergy. Again we are indebted to Dee Smith for an analysis which, with
      some degree of overlapping, groups the Roman Catholic laity as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. First there is that comparatively small group of people whom we may
      designate as “converts” to Romanism, or “joiners,” those who when they see
      the Roman Church growing in influence “jump on the band wagon.” Such as
      these would join most any movement, even the Communist if it appeared to
      offer them advancement. They have only a nominal Christianity, and usually
      have suffered frustration in some form. In Romanism they become the center
      of attention and gain a position of influence that would not otherwise be
      attainable to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A second group, much the largest group in the Roman Church, consists of
      those whom we may designate as spiritual suicides. They shrink from any
      serious thought concerning religious truths which they do not want to
      face, truths which if followed through might involve them in arduous
      spiritual effort. In the Roman Catholic Church they gain a promise of
      heaven through the payment of money and the recitation of sterile
      formulas. They are content simply to float along and to leave the
      spiritual and intellectual problems to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A third group consists of those who are genuinely naive. For them, as
      Dee Smith says, “the beautiful music, gorgeous trappings, fragrant
      incense, majestic temples, and eye-filling spectacles perform the office
      for which Rome designed them, namely, to lull the senses into a state of
      euphoria which the victim mistakes for heavenly transport. Like wide-eyed
      children at a circus, the victims of this form of mass hypnosis see
      nothing of the shoddy meanness behind the glitter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      4. There are those whom we may term the “practical Catholics,” those who
      for personal reasons make a career of their church connections. They are
      the typical members who are always ready to do the bidding of the clergy,
      serving as a front against the non-Catholic world, bullying bookstores
      into refusing to handle anti-Catholic literature, organizing boycotts,
      coercing businessmen to support Catholic charities, posing the threat of
      the “Catholic vote,” etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Another group is that of the “nominal Catholics,” those who are members
      of the church simply because they were born such. They follow the rules of
      the church only so far as it suits their convenience. They are not
      critical of the church, but neither do they have any particular devotion
      for it. They generally attend mass, and they vote for Roman Catholic
      candidates. They are, however, unsteady and a source of concern to the
      clergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. There is a comparatively small group of real liberals, men of integrity
      who try to reconcile the teachings of their church with their consciences
      as long as possible, but who in a showdown between church and conscience
      follow their conscience and walk out of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Lastly, there is the group, consisting of perhaps one third of the
      membership, who by any standard are good, honest, self-respecting people.
      They are, to be sure, somewhat naive, but they are good neighbors to their
      Protestant fellow citizens and are the kind of people for whose sake
      Protestants sometimes resent any insinuations against the Roman Catholic
      Church. They are people who, if they knew the true purpose, motives, and
      character of their church’s leadership, would leave in disgust at the
      betrayal of their faith. They are good not because they are Roman
      Catholics but in spite of that fact. They are the kind of people who, not
      going to the trouble to investigate the doctrinal tenets of the faith they
      profess, would be good in any faith in which they might have membership.
      Innocently and unknowingly they serve as a perfect smokescreen for the
      hierarchy. By using the good character and sincere faith of these
      followers, and by surrounding themselves with a stage-setting of exalted
      faith, the priests are able to create the illusion of true religion for
      their entire system. But that system in its basic reality remains like the
      magnificent Hollywood temples, so impressive and awesome to the untrained
      eye, but in reality nothing more than plywood and canvas (cf., Christian
      Heritage , May, 1959).
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestants who have made any effort to talk with Roman Catholics about
      spiritual things know that they have received but very little Bible
      instruction from their priests. But that lack of Bible knowledge is but a
      natural consequence of the fact that the priests themselves have only a
      minimum of Bible study in their seminary training. L. H. Lehmann, a former
      priest who founded The Converted Catholic Magazine (now Christian Heritage
      ), says that only in the last years of their training in seminary did they
      have any Bible study, and that even then it was in Latin. “The Scripture
      course itself,” he says, “was merely an apologetic for papal
      interpretation of certain texts of Scripture to suit the past historical
      development and aims of the papal power. Nothing was taught or indicated
      to us about the spiritual, individual message of Christ in the Gospel
      itself. Hence, what was sought in teaching the Bible was a glib use of
      tag-ends of texts in defense of papal power. The letter of texts, apart
      from their content, supplied the pretext for Roman Catholic use of
      Scripture. The spirit of the word was overlooked” (The Soul of a Priest ,
      p. 54).
    </p>
    <p>
      A further word about the different orders of priests: As we have indicated
      earlier, there are two classes: (1) Secular or Diocesan priests, who are
      responsible only to the local bishop, and who usually are assigned to
      churches; and (2) Religious priests, who belong to an order, and who in
      most cases are responsible to an abbot who rules the monastery. Secular
      priests take the vows of chastity and obedience, but not of poverty, and
      so may own property. Members of religious orders take the three vows,
      poverty, chastity, and obedience, and are of two classes—monks, who
      withdraw from the world for religious motives, usually live in a
      monastery, and engage in meditation, study, writing, etc.; and the plain
      religious priests, who engage in various public activities for the order
      to which they belong. Those belonging to an order, taking the vows of
      poverty, chastity, and obedience, but not being ordained as priests, are
      called Brothers. These may teach in church schools, or engage in other
      kinds of church work. The Jesuits belong to an order but are not monastic,
      and usually are engaged in educational work in the colleges and
      seminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule the monks have a reputation for being lazy, the Jesuits for
      being industrious. The Jesuits are tightly organized under a military type
      of discipline, and their number is relatively fewer than those of the
      other orders. Their influence, however, has been out of proportion to
      their numbers. For centuries they have been the real power behind the
      papacy, often determining the election of popes, but apparently not
      trusted by their fellow priests and not being able to elect any of their
      own number. They have been the object of much criticism because of their
      advocacy of questionable moral principles, the word “Jesuitical” having
      entered the dictionary as a synonym for that which is crafty, deceptive,
      cunning. On various occasions the Jesuits have been banned from
      practically all of the European and South American countries, from
      Catholic as well as from Protestant countries. On one occasion the order
      was condemned and dissolved by a pope, but was restored by a later pope.
      Often there is bitter rivalry between them and the other orders, which
      they tend to look upon as inferior, or at least as less efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      A custom of the Roman priesthood offensive to Protestants is that of
      having people address them as “father,” and particularly that of calling
      the pope the “Holy Father” (capitalized)—which we term simply blasphemy.
      In this connection Christ Himself commanded in the clearest language that
      the term “father” in a spiritual sense should not be used when addressing
      our fellow men. “Call no man your father on the earth,” said He, “for one
      is your Father, even he who is in heaven” (Matthew 23:9). Yet the priests
      continually and openly violate that command.

  <section>
    <h2>Leaving the Priesthood</h2>
    <p>
      The priesthood is the real crux of the Roman system. Most of those men,
      even during their seminary course, as we have indicated, have but very
      little Bible study; and much of what they do have relates to disconnected
      portions of Scripture and is given primarily with the purpose of preparing
      them to answer the arguments that Protestants make against the Roman
      system. Such has been the testimony of various ones who have left the
      priesthood. There is in this regard a great contrast between the
      Protestant and Roman Catholic training for the ministry or the priesthood.
      Rome simply does not like Bible study either for her priests or for her
      people, for they find too many things there that are not in accord with
      their church.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that if these men could be persuaded to make an unprejudiced
      study of the Bible, many would be convinced of the error of their system
      and would turn from it. An encouraging feature in this regard is that a
      considerable number, after years of useless priestly ministry, have on
      their own accord made a serious study of the Bible and have found that it
      not only does not teach the distinctive doctrines of their church but that
      it contradicts those doctrines. When an honest priest studies
      Protestantism without prejudice, in the light of the Word of God and not
      of Roman tradition, he cannot but recognize that it is Christianity in its
      purity and in its originality. Much to his surprise and contrary to all
      that he has been taught, he finds that Protestantism is very simple, very
      clear, and profoundly attractive. He finds that its doctrines are based
      solidly on the Bible, which is the true manual and code of Christianity.
      Says Lucien Vinet, a former Canadian priest:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the Church of Rome faith is based on the authority of a man, the Pope,
      and the traditions of men, namely the opinions of former theologians such
      as the Fathers of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In Roman Catholicism, Christianity is the doctrines and practices of men;
      in Protestantism, Christianity is the doctrines of Christ as revealed to
      us, not by fallible men, but by the infallible Bible” (7 Was a Priest, p.
      126).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a priest, struggling against moral degradation and frustration of
      mind (and one who spends much time in the confessional has an abundance of
      both), has had an intense battle within himself as to whether or not he
      should remain in the Church of Rome. He possesses a Bible, but in
      accordance with the rules of his church he usually does not dare to read
      it apart from the assigned notes and commentaries, and so remains ignorant
      of its saving message. How difficult it is for him to realize that all
      that anyone has to do to receive forgiveness from sins and to experience
      the joy of salvation is to confess his sins to Christ and to put his trust
      in Him alone! When he does read the Bible he finds that most of the
      doctrines that he has held and taught either were perversions of the
      Scripture or that they were the inventions of men. Would that thousands of
      those men could be persuaded to turn from that false and subversive system
      to the clear teachings of Scripture! The key to the whole problem is the
      priest. And the task before us is to persuade him to read the Bible with
      an open mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem surprising that it takes so long for a priest to discover the
      truth. But the fact is that a candidate for the priesthood enters the
      twelve-year course of training from parochial school as just a boy—the
      preferable age is 16—that during his training he is quite effectively cut
      off from the surrounding world, and that he is an adult before he
      completes his training. He has not known any other kind of life. During
      that long and intensive course practically all of those who show signs of
      independent thinking, those whose dispositions indicate that they might
      not be obedient to their superior, and those in whose make-up there are
      any traits which might indicate lack of perseverance or failure for any
      reason, are weeded out. Not all who finish the course are chosen by the
      bishop for ordination. But those who are chosen are pretty much of a type
      that can be reasonably depended upon to continue loyal and submissive to
      the church. Those who become priests are not so much those who have
      volunteered for that service but rather those who have been chosen by the
      hierarchy and carefully screened and trained for that occupation. They are
      what we may term “hard core Romanists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming a Roman Catholic priest is a far different thing from becoming a
      Protestant minister. Everything possible has been done to impress upon the
      Roman priest the idea that if he breaks with the Roman Catholic Church he
      will not be trusted by anyone, either within or outside of the Roman
      Church, and that he cannot make his way in the commercial world for which
      he now is so entirely unfitted. His intensive training in Latin, doctrine,
      liturgies, and church history, is of comparatively little value in the
      outside world, and in fact has been in part designed to unfit him for
      anything except the priesthood. He has been disciplined for that
      particular work, and his soul is in a real sense held captive within the
      walls of Roman Catholic dogma and within the bonds of the priesthood. It
      is an exceedingly difficult thing for one who has been so trained, and who
      has committed himself to that system, to break those bonds and to come out
      into a new kind of life—even into the freedom of the Gospel, for he does
      not know what that means. This is particularly true if he does not reach
      that decision until middle age or later. Furthermore, the Roman Catholic
      people are forbidden to have anything to do with one who has left the
      priesthood. Getting into, or getting out of, the priesthood is no easy
      task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there are many priests who do not believe what they are
      teaching, at least not all that they are teaching. Many are ill at ease,
      and a considerable number are struggling against a real sense of
      frustration. But they usually remain in the priesthood because they fed
      more or less helpless and do not have the courage to break away.

      Emmett McLoughlin, in an address in Constitution Hall, in Washington,
      D.C., in 1954, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not unusual for people to change their religious affiliation, but
      it is considered very unusual for Roman Catholic priests to leave the
      priesthood. Yet one third of the class of which I was ordained have
      deserted the hierarchy. I know ten priests who have quit St. Mary’s Church
      in Phoenix where I lived for fourteen years. The number of priests
      quitting the priesthood is kept as secret as possible. ... According to
      the best estimate I have been able to find, at least 30 percent of all
      Roman Catholic priests leave Rome.”
    </p>
    <p>In his People’s Padre he says:</p>
    <p>
      “The hold of the Roman Catholic hierarchy over most of the clergy, as I
      have observed it, is not the bond of love, or of loyalty, or of religion.
      It is the almost unbreakable chain of fear—fear of hell, fear of family,
      fear of the public, fear of destitution and insecurity. I firmly believe
      that, in place of the 30 percent of the clergy who probably leave the
      priesthood today, fully 75 percent would do so if it were not for fear.
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “Most priests, torn between the intellectual realization that they have
      been misled by the hierarchy and the fear of family reaction, hesitate and
      live on through barren years in the priesthood. ... Every priest is taught
      through the years that anyone who leaves the priesthood will be not only
      cursed by God but rejected by the public. The priest believes that people
      will sneer at him as one who has violated his solemn promises and
      therefore cannot be trusted with responsibility. In Catholic circles
      mention is never made of ex-priests who are successful—only of those who
      have strayed, who have starved, and who have groveled back to the
      hierarchy, sick, drunken, broken in spirit, begging to do penance for the
      sake of clothes on their backs and food in their bellies” (pp. 98-100).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hundreds of priests quit the church every year. Hundreds more would if
      they had the means of earning a living” (p. 203).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “My experience has proved that an ex-priest can overcome his own fears and
      survive the most concentrated attacks of Roman Catholicism. That
      experience proves also that the American non-Catholic public still
      believes strongly in freedom of thought, freedom of religion, and freedom
      of the right to change one’s means of livelihood—and that it will support
      a man who exercises that right. There is no need for any disillusioned
      priest or nun to seek the protective anonymity of Los Angeles, New York,
      or Detroit. He needs only the courage of his convictions, a willingness to
      work, a deep confidence in America, and a solid faith in God” (p. 261).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucien Vinet gives the following analysis as to why priests remain in the
      priesthood:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no doubt that the great majority of the Roman priests in the
      ministry of their church have come to realize, just as many ex-priests
      have done, the hypocrisy, intrigue, and falsehood of Romanism. There are
      various reasons why so many intellectual men still cling to a false
      religious system and even spend much time and energy in defending this
      un-Christian religious organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests who remain in the priesthood can be classed in four categories:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. “There are some priests who really are convinced that Christ founded
      the Roman Church and that ‘Out of the Church of Rome there is no
      salvation.’ They explain the contradiction between the doctrines of Christ
      and those of Rome as apparent only and believe that the traditions of the
      Roman Church have equal doctrinal value as the words of the Holy Spirit in
      the Bible. They excuse the many scandals of Romanism as a necessary human
      factor in the organization of the Church of God on earth. They believe in
      the infallible teaching authority of the pope and therefore placate their
      conscience in relying on the Pontiff of Rome for their spiritual and
      doctrinal convictions. We met very few priests during the nine years of
      our life in the priesthood, who could be sincerely classed in this
      category. Most priests know just as well as we do that Christ is the only
      Teacher of Christianity and that Romanism is anti-Christian in its
      doctrines and practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. “There are priests who are fully convinced of the falsehood and
      hypocrisy of the Roman priesthood, but find it impossible to leave the
      priesthood. ... Many of them hope that some day an opportunity will be
      given them to quit Romanism. They realize that their training in the
      Seminaries provides no preparation whatever for a proper position in life
      that will enable them to earn a decent living. Their knowledge of Latin,
      Greek, History of the Church, and Roman Theology is to them of very little
      use to obtain a decent position in our modern world. By the time they
      fully realize that their priesthood is a usurpation of the only priesthood
      of Christ and that of the priesthood of believers, they are usually too
      old to start a new training for a proper career in life. Their health not
      be as good as it used to be and they fear that if they leave the
      comfortable existence they now enjoy, they might land in the poor house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The greatest incentive that keeps priests in the priesthood is fear. They
      fear the curse and persecution of Rome, the rebukes of some of their Roman
      Catholic friends, and the loss of esteem and association of their
      families. Some of them, of course, fear hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. “There are now the priests who stay in the priesthood because they like
      the comfort and pleasure that the Roman ministry affords them. It is the
      very life of a priest that they like. They command the respect and
      obedience of many credulous Roman Catholics and they enjoy to the utmost
      dictating to them. ... Their life is assured and they have no troubles.
      Even if they cannot accept all the doctrines of the Church, they do not
      have to admit it publicly. They can travel extensively in distant lands
      where their identity is not known and where they can enjoy life as any
      other human being would do. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      4. “Finally there is a group of priests who remain in the priesthood, not
      on account of their Roman religious convictions and not because they find
      material comfort in the Roman ministry, but because they experience
      indescribable mental and sexual pleasure in the very exercise of their
      Roman ministry. These priests appear to the world as deeply religious and
      ascetic. They seldom indulge in material comforts and no one can accuse
      them of any actual sins of any visible form whatsoever, but they are
      spiritual perverts. The greatest satisfaction or pleasure of their lives
      is not ‘wine, women, and song,’ but the torturing of human souls in
      confession and in spiritual direction. They love to explore secrets of
      souls and hearts. They experience sordid pleasure in embarrassing female
      penitents by impertinent questions and prescriptions. Only the Roman
      system of confession can provide them with the means of indulging in these
      criminal and sordid pleasures” (/ Was a Priest , pp. 75-80).
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vinet also recalls the suggestion of an old priest that if the priests
      in Canada were given ten thousand dollars each there would not be enough
      priests left to man the churches. We don’t suppose anyone is going to
      offer that kind of an inducement for them to leave the priesthood, either
      in Canada or in the United States. But undoubtedly the fear of not being
      able to make a livelihood has kept many in their positions.

  <section>
    <h2>Renouncing Priestly Vows</h2>
    <p>
      We do not hesitate to say that a priest who becomes disillusioned and
      finds that the Church of Rome has deceived him with false pretensions
      should repudiate his vows, declare his independence, and make a new start.
      In such a case the church has misrepresented herself to him, the ideal
      that she held before him has proved deceptive and fruitless, and he
      therefore is not bound to continue in such a relationship. He has not
      failed the priesthood; the priesthood has failed him, and has been
      revealed as something other than that which it was represented as being at
      the time of his ordination. He was led to believe that the Roman Church
      was the only true church, God’s chosen and exclusive instrument for the
      salvation of souls. She has failed to substantiate her claim to be the
      only true church, and has been found rather to be a mixture of truth and
      error, with error in many cases overshadowing the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as the Roman Church has extracted vows that are unscriptural and
      unreasonable, it is right that those vows should be repudiated. This
      principle applies not only to priests and nuns, but also to parents who,
      in signing a marriage contract that was forced upon them, have pledged
      away the religious freedom of their children even before they were born.
      No man has the right to swear away his own religious or civil liberty or
      that of others and so to place himself or those who are given into his
      care in a state of subjection to a fellow mortal. Human slavery, whether
      physical or spiritual, is wrong and cannot be tolerated. Enforced
      spiritual servitude of one’s self or of one’s children to another person
      or institution can be as degrading and galling as physical servitude. “Ye
      were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men,” says the
      Scripture (1 Corinthians 7:23). “Ye were redeemed... with precious
      blood... even the blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:18-19). “No man can serve
      two masters” (Matthew 6:24). Christ is our true Master; He has set us
      free, and no other person or organization has the right to usurp that
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is universally acknowledged that when one party to a contract breaks
      that contract and makes impossible its normal functioning, the other party
      is not under obligation to continue fulfilling its terms. Yet that is the
      condition in which many a priest and nun has found himself or herself.
      Even in human contracts only those obligations continue to be binding
      which the person to whom the promise was made wishes us to observe them;
      and certainly in this field of promises to God it is only reasonable to
      suppose that we are not bound to do what God does not want us to do,
      merely because we were led through false pretenses or false motives to
      promise that we would do it. In this instance the priest has made an
      unscriptural vow of complete obedience to another man, the bishop, and has
      pledged himself to a service that in reality does not exist. We have
      already seen that with the coming of Christ and the completion of His work
      on Calvary the human priesthood was abolished forever. Hence the Roman
      priesthood is in reality nothing but a sham and a delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these grounds all priestly vows are to be considered null and void.
      This was the position taken by the Reformers, Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and
      others, as they renounced the authority of Rome, and the Gospel became the
      proclamation of liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to
      those who were bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who leave Romanism for this reason are not traitors to the church of
      Christ, as the Roman Church attempts to make them believe. On the contrary
      they are enlightened and intelligent men, courageously following the path
      of duty. “The real traitor,” says Lucien Vinet, “is the Roman priest who
      knows the wickedness of Romanism and yet clings to it for material gain”
      (7 Was a Priest, p. 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      “It must come as a shock to non-Catholics,” says McLoughlin, “to realize
      the possessiveness of even the lay Catholics toward their clergy. It is
      accepted practice among Protestant, Mormon, and Jewish groups to recognize
      a clergyman’s right to change his vocation. Rabbis become merchants,
      Mormon bishops enter politics, and ministers in unknown numbers exchange
      the pulpit for farming, law, mining, teaching, trade, or just plain
      loafing. But not so a former Roman Catholic priest” ( People’s Padre , p.
      176).
    </p>
    <p>
      McLoughlin expresses as follows his justification for leaving the
      priesthood:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Many letters from Roman Catholics had lamented that I had broken my
      solemn vows, my word to God. But I felt no guilt. I had entered sincerely
      into a contract, a bilateral contract, when I solemnly vowed poverty,
      chastity, and obedience. I was one party to the agreement. The Provincial
      Superior claimed to represent God. My indoctrination trained me to believe
      that he did. I know now that he did not. The contract was null and void”
      (p. 183).
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “I was an unsuspecting pawn or tool in the greatest swindle of all
      history. ... I have not defied God—I have rejected an organization that
      has usurped the prerogative of God and claims an exclusive right of
      speaking in His name. My only regret is that it took me so many years to
      come to my senses” (pp. 203, 204).
