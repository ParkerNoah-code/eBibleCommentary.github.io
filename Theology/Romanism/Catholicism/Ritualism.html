    <h2>Ritualism</h2>
    <p>
      If we search for the factors that account for the power and influence of
      the Roman Catholic Church, not only over its own members but over many
      others who have no personal connection with that church, we find that one
      of the most important is its ritualistic worship. The gorgeous vestments,
      colorful processions, pageantry and mystifying symbolism, the stately
      music, the solemn intonations of the priests in a singsong voice, the
      flickering candles, the tinkling bells, the sweet-smelling incense, the
      dim light of the cathedral where Mary holds sway—all are designed to
      impress the senses and the emotions. Witnessed in a great cathedral, Roman
      Catholic worship appeals to the senses as much as any spectacular on the
      stage of the Roxy Theatre in New York. Hollywood could never outdo, nor
      even equal, the colorful coronation of Pope John XXIII, in November, 1958,
      as that ritual was presented directly to some fifty thousand persons in
      Rome and to millions more by television and movie film. One news source
      described the coronation spectacle in part as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “...Swiss guards in polished breastplates and scarlet and gold uniforms,
      and a scarletrobed ecclesiastic carrying the pontifical tiara. Chaplains
      in violet soutanes, bishops in white mitres and robes decorated with
      silver; ecclesiastics in scarlet capes, and the College of Cardinals in
      cream colored vestments heavy with gold embroidery, followed each other in
      measured procession. Finally, amid renewed shouts of enthusiasm, the pope
      was carried in by 12 bearers, seated in the gestatorial chair beneath a
      richly embroidered canopy. The pontiff wore a gem-studded mitre and the
      ritual falda. To right and left were members of the noble guard and
      Palatine Guard in gala uniforms.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All of that in a purely manmade religious display, a ritualistic ceremony
      that is not even hinted at anywhere in the Bible! Representative Roman
      Catholic writers acknowledge that the entire series of rites in connection
      with the coronation is unessential since a man becomes pope at the moment
      he accepts the office after his election. There were no papal coronation
      ceremonies before the 10 th century, and the form has varied considerably
      since that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American observer describes a public appearance of the pope in St.
      Peter’s basilica in Rome in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “First, soldier guards with rifles enter—perhaps 50 of them, then the
      papal officials. Then borne by 12 men on their shoulders, a huge chair on
      which the pope sits. He has a white skull cap and is dressed in white
      robes. We see the light flash on the diamond of his crucifix. Twenty
      thousand people shout, ‘Viva il Papal’ ‘Long live the Pope!’ He begins to
      salute the people genially on all sides, scattering his blessings with
      great liberality. He is carried through the full length of the great
      church to the great altar and steps from his chair to a red throne on a
      platform raised above the heads of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The people are wild with enthusiasm. They cheer and raise their children
      to see his face. As one looks about at the beaming faces, one wonders if
      the participants understand the difference between latria and dulia —one
      permits devotion to a holy thing, and the other, devotion due only to God.
      We fear the devotion given him is the type one would give only to his God!
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “As he mounts his chair to be borne out again on the shoulders of 12 men
      dressed in red, the children cry and women plead not to be crushed. The
      pope is carried out, scattering his greetings all about him. As he is
      about to pass the curtain, he rises and again gives the apostolic
      blessing. The vast crowd pours out into the Piazza San Pietro, having seen
      a man who, to most of them, stands in the place of God. It has been the
      highest point in their experience the most exquisite emotion of their
      lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One wonders what passed through the mind of the old man as the delirious
      crowds did him such great honor. Once before crowds exclaimed, ‘It is the
      voice of a god and not of a man’ (Acts 12:22), but God strikingly
      demonstrated His displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How striking was the dissimilarity between the Lord of heaven and His
      pretended vice¬ regent in Rome! Jesus was a humble itinerant preacher, but
      this gentleman rides into the church on the shoulders of 12 men. All the
      pomp, the ostentation, the lights, the ceremony, all the wealth
      imaginable, are employed to enhance the grandeur of an institution which
      in every sense is the opposite of the simple church of the Gospels and the
      book of Acts” (article, Henry F. Brown).
    </p>
    <p>
      Eucharistic and Marianistic congresses, with priests, bishops, and
      cardinals wearing gorgeous robes and bejeweled mitres, present similar
      spectacles. In February, 1946, when thirty-two new cardinals were created
      by Pope Pius XII, Americans were surprised to leam that the scarlet robes
      alone of each new American cardinal’s outfit cost $10,000. The pope’s
      robes, of course, are much more expensive. The jewels in the pope’s
      triple¬ decked crown alone are said to be worth $1,300,000. What a
      contrast with the manner in which Protestant ministers dress! And what a
      contrast with the words of the alleged founder of the Roman Church, the
      Apostle Peter, who said to the lame beggar: “Silver and gold have I none”
      (Acts 3:6). Peter warned against the “wearing of jewels of gold, or of
      putting on apparel” (1 Peter 3:3). Paul, too, could say, “I coveted no
      man’s silver, or gold, or apparel” (Acts 20:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people however, want to be dazzled with a theatrical display of
      religion, and the Roman Church readily obliges. But the total effect of
      such ritualistic displays, so lacking in spiritual instruction is usually
      repulsive to thoughtful minds, and is entirely outside the bounds of true
      Christianity. What spiritually sensitive souls most condemn seems often to
      have been the chief attraction for the great mass of people who, without
      interest in religion as such, are moved by the spectacular display of what
      seems to be a union of the human and the divine. To the ignorant and
      uneducated, and also to a considerable extent to the educated, the
      splendor of the Roman Church appears as something awesome, fascinating,
      and inspiring. But many a spiritually weary traveler has found after all
      that such ritual and ceremony is only a mirage seen from a distance, a
      gorgeous display promising rest for the traveler on his way through a
      desert land, but failing utterly to supply the water of life that could
      bring peace and joy to his thirsty heart. Gradually the mirage fades on
      the horizon, and the desert that was to have bloomed as the rose yields
      only briars and thorns. How different from all that is the evangelical
      Protestant service, where with a minimum of ritual the emphasis is on the
      sermon which is designed to impart Biblical knowledge and to nurture and
      edify the spiritual and moral nature of man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the rituals and ceremonials of Romanism, Stephen L. Testa says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pagan Rome and Jewish Jerusalem had these ceremonials. But when Christ
      came to save the world He did not copy or adopt any of them; rather He
      disdained them. He founded His church, not as a hierarchy, but as a simple
      brotherhood of saved souls, commissioned to preach the Gospel to all the
      world. The early church, the church of the catacombs, for 300 years had no
      such ceremonials. It was in the fourth century, after the so-called
      conversion of Emperor Constantine, that he made Christianity the State
      Church and those pagan ceremonials were introduced. It was then that the
      Catholic Church became the Roman Catholic Church. Italy and the other
      Catholic countries have derived no benefit whatever, spiritual or
      material, from them, as anyone can see for himself. The Reformation of
      course rejected them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We are often amazed at the magnificence of Roman Catholic churches and
      cathedrals, even in areas where the people are comparatively poor, or even
      in poverty. The following account of how the Roman Church developed in one
      area is given by August Vanderark, in the booklet, Christ the Hope of
      Mexico:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The American visitor to Mexico is often amazed to discover an abundance
      of large beautiful churches in almost every part of the nation. Frequently
      the question arises, ‘How could they afford to construct such a vast
      number of imposing edifices?’ The answer, of course, is slave labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Following the conquest by Cortez, the Indians were forced into slavery by
      the Roman Church and put to work building its places of worship and other
      religious structures. In Henry Bamford Parkes’ most excellent work, A
      History of Mexico, we read: ‘Twelve thousand churches were built in Mexico
      during the colonial period; and though they testify to the triumph of
      Christ over Huitzilopochtli (chief god of the Aztecs), they also testify
      to the skill of the missionaries (Jesuits) in obtaining unpaid labor from
      the Indians.’ Many of the Indians died as a result of being forced into
      the strenuous labor to which they were not accustomed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanism is largely a religion of ceremonials and rituals, and as such it
      is a far departure from the purity and simplicity of the Gospel. The
      supposed blessing is mysterious and magical. No really intelligent
      participation is required on the part of the people. They are largely
      spectators watching the pageantry, and are supposed to be blessed simply
      because they are there. The mystifying mannerisms of the priests, and the
      mumble-jumble of the unknown tongue used at the altar, tend more toward
      credulity and superstition. Fifteen centuries of history make it clear
      that the Roman ritual is powerless to uplift the world. Indeed, is it any
      wonder that Roman Catholic countries are proverbially impoverished,
      illiterate, and degraded? We charge Rome with obscuring rather than
      revealing the simple truth of the way of salvation as set forth in the
      Bible, and with the addition of many doctrines and practices not found in
      the Bible. When we tear aside the gaudy trappings of Romanism we find only
      an ugly skeleton, which, because it cannot find support in Scripture, is
      not able to stand on its own feet. Applicable here are the words of Joel:
      “Rend your heart, and not your garments” (2:13); and especially the words
      of Isaiah:
    </p>
    <p>
      “What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have
      had enough of the bumt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; for I
      delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. When ye
      come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample
      my courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
      me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies—I cannot away with
      iniquity and the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts
      my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them”
      (1:11-14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Elaborate ritual and ceremony, which theoretically are designed to aid the
      worshipper, usually have the opposite effect in that they tend to take the
      mind away from things which are spiritual and eternal and to center it on
      that which is material and temporal. Artistic ritual and exquisite music
      often become ends in themselves, and can easily become instruments which
      prevent the people from joining in the worship of God. The reason the
      Roman service tends to become more and more elaborate, liturgical, and
      ritualistic, is that the heart of the exercise, true adoration of God, is
      missing, and a persistent effort is made to fill up the emptiness and
      unsatisfactoriness of it all by piling one ceremony and ritual upon
      another. But ironically, the more that is done the more difficult it
      becomes to worship God, and so the vicious circle goes round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We object to the elaborate ceremonials and gorgeous furnishings of
      Romanism, not because of any lack of aesthetic taste, but on theological
      grounds. Such things may be all right in a theater, but they are out of
      place in a Christian church. Within proper limits dignity and beauty are
      characteristics which are proper in the worship of God, as indeed is clear
      from the prescriptions for worship which were given to the children of
      Israel. But the various elements of the Old Testament ritual were types
      and shadows portraying God’s plan of salvation. Their purpose was to
      present the Gospel in picture to a primitive people. But those things were
      done away in Christ, and no others were put in their place (Hebrews 8:5,
      9:23, 10:1). The only references to incense, for example, in connection
      with the New Testament church are found in the book of Revelation where it
      is used figuratively, referring to the prayers of God’s people (Revelation
      5:8, 8:3-4). Romanism is in this respect a recrudescence of Judaism, and
      in its ceremonialism stands much closer to Judaism than to New Testament
      Christianity. It has a delight in the picture language of ceremonies that
      were designed for the childhood of the church, and it still is fascinated
      with the beauty of the temple and its gorgeous ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      We maintain that the New Testament assigns no liturgy at all for the
      church. We maintain further that there is a beauty in chaste simplicity,
      that this characterized the early church, that the departure from this
      simplicity in the fourth and later centuries was the result of spiritual
      deterioration, and that most of the ritualism and ceremonialism was taken
      over from the pagan religion of ancient Rome. But while no required form
      is demanded, it is necessary that some systematic form be developed, so
      that “all things” may be done “decently and in order” (1 Corinthians 14
      40). Most churches develop an order of service sufficient to give order
      and dignity to the service without going to the extreme of Romanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Protestants not be deceived by the outward splendor of Romanism. The
      most elaborate rituals will not save one if the heart is not right.
      Neither the two thousand proscriptions of the Canon Law, nor all the
      absolutions of the priests, can open the kingdom of heaven for one who is
      not first of all a true believer.

    <h2>Ceremonials</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the ceremonials of Romanism are of special interest. First of all
      and most important is the Ave Maria, or “Hail Mary,” which was used in
      part as early as 1508, completed 50 years later, and finally approved for
      general use by Pope Sixtus V at the end of the 16 th century. It reads as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among
      women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of
      God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Hail Mary” is thus a prayer. It is repeated many times in the
      churches, in the schools, and by individuals in private as a work of
      penance and as one of the most effective means of storing up merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ceremonial, always used by Roman Catholics in entering a church as
      well as in various personal acts, is the sign of the cross. This is
      considered both a prayer and a public profession of faith. In entering a
      church they dip the forefinger of the right hand in holy water, and touch
      the forehead, the breast, and the left and right shoulder, thus tracing
      upon their person the figure of the cross while reciting aloud or in
      silence the words, “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
      Holy Ghost. Amen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fasting has a prominent place in Romanism. When carried out according to
      the rules of the church it is supposed to gain certain merits for the
      person fasting. A fast day is not one on which no food at all is eaten, as
      the name might imply, but one on which persons over twenty-one and under
      sixty years of age are allowed but one full meal, and are forbidden meats,
      unless granted a special dispensation. A day of abstinence is one on which
      meat is forbidden, but the usual number of meals is allowed. Fasting is
      required during Lent<sup>1</sup> (the forty week-days preceding Easter),
      and on certain other appointed days. Fish, but not other meat, allowed on
      Fridays. This, like the days of fasting and the days of abstinence, is of
      course an empty formalism, a purely arbitrary rule, without any New
      Testament authority, and can be set aside at any time by a dispensation
      from the priest because of hard work, sickness, or for various other
      reasons. Yet the people are taught that under normal conditions it is a
      mortal sin to eat meat on Friday and on other days of abstinence. In 1958
      Pope John XXIII granted Roman Catholics throughout the world a special
      dispensation to eat meat on Friday, December 26, the day after Christmas,
      because of continued Christmas festivities and celebrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> On February 17, 1988 Pope Paul VI relaxed the Lenten rules
      for fasting except for Wednesday and Good Friday. The general rule against
      eating meat on Friday has also been abolished. Thus what only a short time
      ago was a mortal sin now becomes permissible, changed by the bishops as
      nonchalantly as if they were merely changing for worship on Sunday
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fasts commanded by the Church of Rome are wholly different from those
      in the Old Testament. Rome’s fasts are purely arbitrary and mechanical,
      not spiritual, appointed by the popes. They are not necessarily connected
      with any religious observances. The wild revelry, drinking, and feasting
      which precedes Lent and other occasions in Roman communities, particularly
      that best known one, the Mardi Gras carnival in New Orleans and some other
      cities, proves this beyond dispute. True fasting is a spiritual exercise
      usually connected with prayer, repentance, and meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mere arbitrary fasting is denounced in Scripture as an abomination. To
      Jeremiah God said concerning the people of Israel, who were outwardly
      religious and observed forms but who in heart rejected Him and broke His
      commandments: “Pray not for this people for their good. When they fast, I
      will not hear their cry” (14:12). Christ rebuked the Pharisees because
      they were particular about keeping the fasts but neglected obedience to
      God (Matthew 6:16), and Paul warned against manmade commandments “to
      abstain from meats” as a mark of apostasy (1 Timothy 4:3). How completely
      arbitrary and unchristian are commandments which impose fasts, making
      certain meats edible on some days but not on others, edible at certain
      times of the day but not at other times, and for some people but not for
      others! Paul’s words concerning food dedicated to an idol are equally
      applicable here: “But food will not commend us to God: neither if we eat
      not, are we the worse; nor if we eat, are we the better” (1 Corinthians
      8:8). That, in fact, is the New Testament principle as regards eating or
      fasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another Roman ceremonial is flagellation, or self-torture. This is
      not to be thought of as merely a barbaric and stupid custom practiced back
      in the Middle Ages. In some places it still is a reality in our twentieth
      century. Emmett McLoughlin, in his People’s Padre (p. 17), tells how three
      times a week, at a certain hour in the evening, the students in the
      seminary where he obtained his training were required to go to their
      rooms, disrobe, and practice flagellation. And in a recent popular movie,
      The Nun’s Story , produced under Roman Catholic supervision, the mother
      superior is pictured handing the novitiate girl a whip which she is to use
      on herself, with the admonition that she should use it “neither too
      little, nor too much”; “for,” said the mother superior, “the one is as bad
      as the other.” In the Philippine Islands the fanatical “Flagellantes,” at
      the Lenten season each year can be seen in processions, carrying heavy
      crosses, chanting Latin hymns, and beating their bodies with a scourge
      until the flesh is raw and bleeding, in a blind hope that through that
      kind of suffering merit will be stored up and their souls will be released
      sooner from purgatory. How can an intelligent and professedly Christian
      priesthood allow such things to continue? Flagellation, however, has never
      been practiced by the rank and file of Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important peculiarity of the Roman Church has been its use of the
      Latin language. It has been a long standing rule that the mass cannot be
      celebrated in any language other than Latin, that it is better not to
      celebrate mass at all than to do so in the language of the people.
      However, the Second Vatican Council, in 1964, gave permission for the mass
      to be celebrated in the common tongue, or for a translation to be provided
      so that the people can follow intelligently what is being said. Early in
      the Middle Ages, about the year 600, preaching in the Latin tongue was
      instituted—which surely was one of the most ridiculous things in the
      world. Latin had been the basis of the Italian language, but was no longer
      understood by the people. However, preaching never was a very important
      part of the Roman service, and it is no longer conducted in Latin. But the
      mass, which is the very heart of the service, still is in Latin,<sup
        >2</sup
      >
      although the great majority of present day congregations know nothing
      about Latin. A little reflection should convince anyone that neither the
      Lord’s supper as instituted by Christ, nor His passion, which is reenacted
      in the mass, was done in Latin. Christ spoke the Aramaic of His day, which
      was the language of the people. Yet Roman priests hold that it is a
      sacrilege to commemorate that experience in anything but Latin!
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup> The requirement regarding Latin was relaxed by pope Paul VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle Paul, who himself was a scholar and who probably could speak
      more languages than anyone in his audiences, nevertheless insisted that a
      few words spoken with the understanding were better than many spoken in a
      tongue that could not be understood: “Howbeit in the church I had rather
      speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also,
      than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19); and again: “If
      any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and
      that in turn; and let one interpret: but if there be no interpreter, let
      him keep silence in the church” (1 Corinthians 14:28 ); and further: “So
      also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how
      shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air” (1
      Corinthians 14:9). Protestants always conduct their services in language
      of the people and that surely is more uplifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain benefits, however, which in a may seem to accrue to the
      Roman Church as it conducts its ceremonials under the veil of a dead
      language. Most importantly, it adds to the air of mystery that surrounds
      the service, and helps to set the priest apart from the people as a man
      with special wisdom and special powers. Every priest at times has to bless
      the “holy water” with which Roman Catholics sprinkle themselves, and which
      is sprinkled on various objects to purify or consecrate them. The prayer
      by which that is done intimates that its object really is to drive the
      devils out of this common water, and indirectly to keep them from the
      people who are sprinkled. Probably not one priest in a hundred really
      believes that, and it doubtless would seem rather crude and awkward to go
      through the ritual in English. But they do not seem to mind doing it in
      Latin. In Medieval times it was customary for the priest to do a
      preliminary devil chase before the service began by going back through the
      audience and sprinkling holy water on the people while calling on all
      demons and devils to depart. The baptism of infants is an elaborate ritual
      in which the Devil is exorcised and commanded to depart from the child,
      and undoubtedly would be somewhat embarrassing if done in English. Yet the
      Latin ritual is accepted without question. Also, the mother who has given
      birth to a child is considered polluted and unfit to enter the church with
      respectable people until she has been “churched” through the use of an
      ancient ritual which if spoken in English probably would cause so much
      resentment that it would have to be abandoned. And in theological books
      detailed instructions to the priests concerning questions relating to sex
      to be asked of women and girl penitents in the confessional are given in
      Latin, and so in the main are kept concealed from the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another problem to be considered in this connection is the
      appearance of priests and nuns in public in their church garb, which of
      course is offensive to Protestants. Recently C. Stanley Lowell wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In long-suffering Mexico which finally rose up in wrath against the
      church, to this day the clergy are not permitted to appear on the streets
      in clerical garb. Resentment mounted to such a pitch that the people did
      not even want to look at the clergy.”
    </p>
    <p>And again:</p>
    <p>
      “Roman Catholic politicians dote on public demonstrations of their
      denominational symbols and observances. Roman Catholicism is a majority
      faith in many areas of this country. As a majority faith Catholics
      frequently show insensibility to the religious sensitivities of those who
      do not share their faith. They may flaunt their religious practices and
      virtually force them on the entire community. They have an astonishing
      faculty for never suspecting that the symbol or observance which inspires
      them may be shocking and abhorrent to persons of another faith.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that Romanist religious regalia is almost always offensive to
      those who do not belong to that church. Oftentimes the tendency toward
      forcing their religion on other people of the community is also carried
      out by dedicating public statues, parks, schools, etc., to Roman Catholic
      saints or church leaders. We submit that in fairness to all the people of
      a community statues, parks, schools, etc., should not be given names that
      are offensive to the people of the community who are of other faiths.

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
      In the first commandment we are commanded to worship God, and none other.
      In the second commandment we are commanded to worship directly and not
      through any intervening object: “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven
      image... thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. ...”
      (Exodus 20:4-5). Literally hundreds of other passages also condemn the
      making or worshipping of images. A few examples are:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image,
      or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow
      down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God” (Leviticus 26:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination
      unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and setteth it up in
      secret” (Deuteronomy 27:15).
    </p>
    <p>“My little children, guard yourselves from idols” (1 John 5:21).</p>
    <p>
      “...the works of their hands... the idols of gold, and of silver, and of
      brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor
      walk” (Revelation 9:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      “What agreement hath a temple of God with idols?” (2 Corinthians 6:16).
    </p>
    <p>The Jerusalem Conference warned the Gentiles:</p>
    <p>“...that they abstain from the pollution of idols” (Acts 15:20).</p>
    <p>
      How very clearly, then, the commandment against the making or use of
      images or idols (for they are the same thing if used in worship) is
      written into the law of God!
    </p>
    <p>But in direct opposition to this the Council of Trent decreed:</p>
    <p>
      “The images of Christ and the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other
      saints, are to be had and to be kept, especially in Churches, and due
      honor and veneration are to be given them” (Sess. 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Where can a more deliberate and willful contradiction of the command of
      God be found than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice of the Church of Rome is that she solemnly consecrates images
      through the blessing of her priests, places them in her churches and in
      the homes of her people, offers incense before them, and teaches the
      people to bow down and worship before them. It cannot be denied that the
      Roman Church has made the second commandment of no effect among her
      people, and that she teaches for Christian doctrine her own precepts,
      which are the commands of men. She has not dared to remove the commandment
      from her Bible, but she has withdrawn it as much as possible from view.
      Since her practices are contrary to the Bible, she covers up her guilt by
      simply omitting that commandment from her version of the Decalogue and
      from her catechisms and textbooks! She then re-numbers the commandments,
      making the third number two, the fourth number three, and so on. And in
      order to cover up this deficiency, she splits the tenth commandment in
      two, thus making two separate sins of coveting—that of coveting one’s
      neighbor’s wife, and that of coveting one’s neighbor’s goods. As a result
      of this sophistry multitudes of people are misled and are caused to commit
      the sin of idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this official encouragement it is not surprising that images of
      Christ, Mary, the saints and angels are very common in Roman Catholic
      circles. They are found in the churches, schools, hospitals, homes, and
      other places. Occasionally one even sees a little image of Jesus or Mary
      or some saint on the dashboard of an automobile (often the image of St.
      Christopher, the patron saint of travelers). Thus as one drives he
      supposedly has the protection of Jesus, or Mary, or the saint.<sup>3</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>3</sup> On May 14, 1969 Pope Paul VI demoted 33 saints from the level
      of universal veneration to that of local or regional levels. Those
      included Christopher (whose existence is not certain); Nicholas, patron
      saint of gifts and givers; Valentine, patron saint of lovers; and Barbara,
      patron saint of artillerymen. There remain 58, plus Mary, Joseph, the
      apostles, and the angels, who are objects of universal veneration must be
      mentioned at mass at least once a year. And there are hundreds of others
      at lower levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman Catholics tell us that they do not pray to the image, or idol, but
      to the spirit that is represented by it. But that is the answer given by
      idol worshippers the world over when they are asked why they pray to their
      idols. That was the answer given by the Israelites when they worshipped
      the golden calf in the wilderness; for after making the idol they said:
      “These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of
      Egypt” (Exodus 32:4). They did not intend their worship to terminate on
      the image. They were worshipping their gods through the use of an image,
      or idol, a likeness which they thought appropriately represented their
      gods. But on other occasions the Israelites worshipped idols as such.
      Hosea’s condemnation of idolatry in Israel: “The workman made it; there
      fore it is not God” (8:6), implies that the calf of Samaria was worshipped
      in the Northern Kingdom as a god. See also Psalm 115:4-8. Undoubtedly the
      better educated do make the distinction between the idol and the god or
      spirit which it is designed to represent. But in actual practice in Roman
      Catholic countries and among the ignorant, the tendency is for this
      distinction to disappear and for such worship to become simply idolatry.
      The Old Testament prophets and the Bible as a whole makes no distinction
      between false gods and their images, and the cult practices of the heathen
      tend to identify them completely. The Israelites were severely condemned
      for using idols in their worship of God. It cannot be otherwise with the
      Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      On numerous later occasions the Israelites attempted to worship God
      through the use of images, but such practices were always severely
      condemned. Even if it were true that Roman Catholics pray only to the
      person or spirit represented by the image, it still would be sin, for two
      reasons: (1) God has forbidden the use of images in worship; (2) there is
      only one mediator between God and men, and that one is Christ, not Mary or
      the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, when men have made images or idols which they could see, as
      an aid to worship, they later came to think of the images themselves as
      indwelt by their gods. The images became the centers of attention rather
      than that which they were supposed to represent. Instead of helping the
      worshippers they confused them. This has been particularly true in regard
      to the larger images which are preserved from one generation to another.
      In the same manner as the heathen, the Romanists make gods of wood and
      stone, dress them up, paint them with gaudy colors, bow down before them,
      and worship them. The priests encourage the people to have little shrines
      in their homes at which they can worship. Millions of illiterate people in
      Europe and in the Americas attribute supernatural qualities to those
      images. In doing so they feel that they have the full approval of their
      church—which of course they do have. But the Bible calls such practice
      idolatry and condemns it. The Bible teaches that God is a Spirit, and that
      they that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth (John 4:24). We
      should never forget that one of the most heinous sins of ancient Israel,
      in fact the besetting sin of ancient Israel, was the worship of idols, and
      that Israel paid a fearful penalty for that practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were the apostles to return to earth and eater a Roman Catholic church,
      they would scarcely be able to distinguish between the pagan worship of
      idols that they knew and the present day practice of kneeling before
      images, burning incense to them, kissing them, praying to them, and
      carrying them in public processions. The Roman Church today is about as
      thoroughly given over to idolatry as was the city of Athens when Paul
      visited there. Many priests do not believe in images, but they keep them
      in their churches because it is established custom and because, they say,
      it helps the worshippers, particularly if they are uneducated, to have a
      visual representation of the person they are worshipping.
    </p>
    <p>But how very foolish is the practice of idolatry!</p>
    <p>For life man prays to that which is dead.</p>
    <p>For health he prays to that which has no health or strength.</p>
    <p>For a good journey he prays to that which cannot move a foot.</p>
    <p>For skill and good success he prays to that which cannot do anything.</p>
    <p>
      For wisdom and guidance and blessing he commits himself to a senseless
      piece of wood or stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanism, with its image or idol worship, has no appeal at all for the
      Mohammedan world, which is so strongly opposed to all forms of idolatry.
      In fact it has made practically no attempt to win Mohammedans. The great
      mission field of North Africa lies only a short distance across the
      Mediterranean from Italy, practically on Rome’s doorstep. But through the
      centuries that field has remained almost untouched and unchallenged by
      Roman Catholicism. Yet Rome sends thousands of missionaries across the
      oceans to India, Japan, South America, and even to the United States,
      which even by Roman standards is in much less need of them than is North
      Africa. Nor does Roman Catholicism have any attraction for the Jews, who
      also are strongly opposed to all forms of idolatry. Instead, the Roman
      Church persecuted the Jews for some fifteen centuries. The evangelization
      of both Jews and Mohammedans has been left almost exclusively to
      Protestants. As we have indicated earlier, Roman Catholics attempt to
      justify the use of images by making a distinction between what they term
      latria, which is devotion given only to God, hyper-dulia, which is given
      to Mary, and dulia, a lower form of devotion which is given to the saints,
      images, and relics. But in practice that distinction breaks down. The
      people, particularly those who are illiterate, of whom the Roman Catholic
      countries have so many, know nothing of the technical distinctions made by
      the theologians. They worship the images of Mary and the saints in the
      same way and often with more fervency than they worship those of Christ,
      or the “Blessed Sacrament” which they believe is the actual body, soul,
      and divinity of Christ. The only name for their practice is idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Testament strictly forbade image worship, and in time such
      practice came to be an abomination to the Jews. With that background it
      seems incredible that idols should ever have been admitted into the more
      spiritual worship of the Christian church. But in the fourth century, with
      the granting of official status to the Christian church and the great
      influx of pagans, the heathen element in the church became so strong that
      it overcame the natural opposition to the use of images. Most of the
      people could not read. Hence it was argued that visible representations of
      Scripture persons and events were helpful in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the seventh century. Pope Gregory the Great (590-604),
      one of the strongest of the popes, officially approved the use of images
      in the churches, but insisted that they must not be worshipped. But during
      the eighth century prayers were addressed to them and they were surrounded
      by an atmosphere of ignorant superstition, so that even the Mohammedans
      taunted the Christians with being idol worshippers. In 726 the Eastern
      emperor, Leo III, first attempted to remedy the abuse in his dominion by
      ordering that the images and pictures be placed so high that the
      worshippers could not kiss them. But when that failed to achieve the
      desired ends, he issued an order forbidding the use of images in the
      churches as heathenish and heretical. To support his action a council was
      called in Constantinople, in 754, which gave ecclesiastical sanction to
      his actions. This great controversy became known as the “iconoclastic”
      dispute, a word which means the breaking of images. The Eastern church
      banned all use of images or icons, and to this day that remains one of the
      great contrasts between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholic
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in 787 a council met at Nicaea (Bithynia), repudiated the work of the
      earlier council, and fully sanctioned the worship of images and pictures
      in the churches. This action was defended on the principle on which image
      worship, whether among the heathen or Christians, has generally been
      defended, namely, that the worship does not terminate on the image but on
      the object that it represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Aquinas, who is generally acknowledged as the outstanding medieval
      theologian of the Roman Church, fully defended the use of images, holding
      that they were to be used for the instruction of the uses who could not
      read and that pious feelings were excited more easily by what people see
      than by what they hear. The popes of the Roman Church have strongly
      supported the use of images.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument in favor of the use of images, that in the Old Testament God
      commanded the making of the cherubim and the brazen serpent, ignores the
      fact that the cherubim were not to be used in worship, whereas the images
      are. The cherubim were placed in the holy of holies where they were not
      seen by the people but only by the high priest, and then only as he
      entered once each year, whereas the images are displayed in public. A
      further and most important difference is that God commanded the making of
      the cherubim, but He strictly forbade the making of images. Likewise the
      brazen serpent was not made to be worshipped. When it later became a
      sacred relic and was worshipped by people who offered incense to it, good
      king Hezekiah destroyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral and religious effects of image worship are invariably bad. It
      degrades the worship of God. It turns the minds of the people from God,
      who is the true object of worship, and leads them to put their trust in
      gods who seem near at hand but who cannot save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely akin to the use of images is that of pictures of Christ. And
      these, we are sorry to say, are often found in Protestant as well as Roman
      Catholic churches. But nowhere in the Bible, in either the Old or New
      Testament, is there a description of Christ’s physical features. No
      picture of Him was painted during His earthly ministry. The church had no
      pictures of Him during the first four centuries. The so-called pictures of
      Christ, like those of Mary and the saints, are merely the product of the
      artist’s imagination. That is why there are so many different ones. It is
      simply an untruth to say that any one of them is a picture of Christ. All
      that we know about His physical features is that He was of Jewish
      nationality. Yet He more often is represented as having light features,
      even as an Aryan with golden hair. How would you like it if someone who
      had never seen you and who knew nothing at all about your physical
      features, resorted to his imagination and, drawing on the features of his
      own nationality, painted a picture and told everyone that it was a picture
      of you? Such a picture would be fraudulent. Certainly you would resent it.
      And certainly Christ must resent all these counterfeit pictures of Him. He
      was the truth; and we can be sure that He would not approve of any form of
      false teaching. No picture can do justice to His personality, for He was
      not only human but divine. And no picture can portray His deity. All such
      pictures are therefore fatally defective. Like the grave of Moses, the
      physical features of Christ were intended to be kept beyond the reach of
      idolatry. For most people the so-called pictures of Christ are not an aid
      to worship, but rather a hindrance, and for many they present a temptation
      to that very idolatry against which the Scriptures warn so clearly.

<div id="Rosary" dropdownName="Rosary, Crucifix" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Rosary, Crucifix, Scapulars</h2>
    <p>
      The rosary may be defined as (1) a series of prayers, in its long form
      consisting of 15 Paternosters (the Lord’s prayer, addressed to God the
      Father), 15 Glorias, and 150 Hail Mary’s addressed to the Virgin Mary; or
      (2) the mechanical device used in counting the prayers, the short and more
      common form being a string or chain of beads divided into five sections,
      each consisting of one large bead and ten small ones. The large rosary
      consists of fifteen sections. But usually one who wishes to say the
      complete rosary goes over the short form three times. In some religious
      orders the large rosary is used, and is worn as a part of religious habit.
      Holding the large bead of each section in turn, one says the Our Father,
      and holding the small ones the Hail Mary for each separate bead. Between
      each section the Gloria is said: “Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
      and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
      be, world without end. Amen.” The Apostles’ Creed may also be recited with
      the rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the origin of the term “rosary,” a book, Things Catholics Are Asked
      About, by Martin J. Scott, S. J., says: “Rosary means a garland of roses.
      A legend has it that Our Lady was seen to take rosebuds from the lips of a
      young monk when he was reciting Hail Mary’s, and to weave them into a
      garland which he placed on her head” (p. 237). Another explanation is that
      the beads originally were made of rosewood. But they may also be of glass,
      stone, or other hard material.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosary has ten times as many prayers addressed to Mary as to God the
      Father, with none addressed to Christ or the Holy Spirit. It is designed
      primarily as a devotional to Mary, thus exalting a human being more than
      God. It is more commonly used by girls and women, and is by far the most
      popular and universal devotion in the Roman Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter the Hermit invented the rosary, in the year 1090, more than a
      thousand years after the time of Christ. It is acknowledged by Roman
      Catholics not to have come into general use until after the beginning of
      the 13 th century, and was not given official sanction until after the
      Protestant Reformation in the 16 th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rosary represents a form of prayer that was expressly condemned by
      Christ, for He said: “And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the
      Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much
      speaking. Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
      things ye have need of before ye ask him” (Matthew 6:7-8). Yet the priests
      encourage their people to use the rosary frequently, and in giving
      penances after confession they often assign a certain number of Hail
      Mary’s to be said. The more such prayers are said the more merit is stored
      up in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that the true believer should pray to God reverently,
      humbly, and with a believing and thankful heart, thinking of what he doing
      and of the great King to whom he is praying. It is a distinguishing mark
      of Romanism, and also a matter of primary importance between Romanism and
      Protestantism, that a Roman Catholic “says” or “recites” his prayers,
      while for the most part the Protestant speaks extemporaneously, with his
      own words, thinking out his praise, petitions, requests, and thanks as he
      prays. For a spiritually minded person the mechanical use of beads
      destroys the true spirit of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mechanical device similar to the rosary and used for counting prayers
      had been in use among the Buddhists and Mohammedans for centuries before
      the rosary was introduced, so its origin is not hard to trace. It is
      simply another device borrowed from paganism. And, strange as it may seem,
      Roman Catholics who condemn as pagan and foolish the use of prayer wheels
      by the Buddhists in Tibet (wheels with attached prayers, placed in a
      stream of water or in the wind so that each time the wheel turns over the
      prayer is repeated), nevertheless display great devotion in counting their
      repetitious rosary prayers as one bead after another is pushed across the
      string. But surely the principle is exactly the same. A similar practice
      is the use of eight-day candles in little red cups, usually placed at the
      front and to one side in the churches, which are sold to those who are so
      busy they do not have time to pray. Indeed, why should Roman priests
      condemn the chanted incantations of African and West Indies Voodoo priests
      while themselves continuing the practice of sprinkling holy water with
      solemn exorcisms of demons or evil spirits?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crosses and crucifixes. The most widely used religious symbol both for
      Roman Catholics and Protestants is the cross, much more so in Roman
      Catholic than in Protestant churches. The crucifix is a cross with the
      figure of Christ crucified upon it. In the Roman Church the sign of the
      cross has to be in every altar, on the roofs of all Roman Catholic
      churches, in the school and hospital rooms, and in the homes of its
      people. For interior use the crucifix is often displayed rather than the
      cross. Small crosses four or five inches long and suspended on a chain are
      often worn as part of the religious garb of priests and nuns, and a small
      gold cross on a chain suspended around the neck is often worn by the
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as regards the cross as a symbol of Christianity, we must point out
      that the Scriptures do not give one single instance in which a mechanical
      cross was so used, or in which it was venerated in any way. There are, of
      course, numerous instances in Scripture in which the cross is spoken of
      figuratively. Nor is there any evidence that the cross was used as a
      Christian symbol during the first three centuries of the Christian era. A
      Roman Catholic authority asserts:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It may be safely assumed that only after the edict of Milan, A.D. 312,
      was the cross used as a permanent sign of our redemption. De Rossi (a
      Roman Catholic archaeologist) states positively that no monogram of
      Christ, discovered in the Catacombs or other places, can be traced to a
      period anterior to the year A.D. 312” ( The American Ecclesiastical Review
      , p. 275; September, 1920).
    </p>
    <p>
      The cross as a symbol of Christianity, then, it is generally agreed, goes
      back only to the days of emperor Constantine, who is supposed to have
      turned from paganism to Christianity. In the year 312 he was engaged in a
      military campaign in western Europe. According to tradition he called upon
      the pagan gods, but there was no response. Shortly afterward he saw in the
      sky a pillar of light in the form of a cross, on which were written the
      words, “In hoc signo vinces ,” “In this sign conquer.” Shortly afterward
      he crossed into Italy and won a decisive victory near Rome. Taking this as
      a token of divine favor, he issued various edicts in favor of the
      Christians. Whether he ever became a Christian or not is disputed, some
      holding that he remained a pagan all his life and promoted paganism and
      Christianity alternately as best served his purposes, although he
      professed Christianity and was baptized shortly before his death in 337.
      At any rate, the alleged sign in the sky, like so many other signs of that
      and later times, undoubtedly will have to be explained on other grounds.
      The idea that Christ would command a pagan emperor to make a military
      banner embodying the cross and to go forth conquering in that sign is
      wholly inconsistent with the general teaching if the Bible and with the
      spirit of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any event, the cross, in pre-Christian as well as in Christian times,
      has always been looked upon as an instrument of torture and shame.
      Christians do not act wisely when they make such an instrument an object
      of reverence and devotion. Paul spoke of what he termed “the offense of
      the cross” (Galatians 5:11, KJV). And in Hebrews 12:2 we read that Jesus
      “endured the cross, despising the shame.” In view of these things we
      should not regard the device on which Christ was crucified as holy or as
      an object of devotion. Rather we should recognize it for what it is, a
      detestable thing, a pagan symbol of sin and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jesus said: “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself,
      and take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24), He did not mean
      that one should have a gold representation of it hanging from a chain
      about his neck or dangling from long cords at his side. He meant rather
      that one who is a faithful follower should be willing to do His will, to
      serve and to endure suffering as He did, since all those who sincerely
      follow Him will meet with some degree of hardship and suffering and
      perhaps even with persecution. Ever since the time that the emperor
      Constantine allegedly saw the sign of the cross in the sky, and took that
      as his banner, that banner has been raised over a half-Christian, half¬
      pagan church. Protestant churches, too, have often offended in matter,
      and, like Lot, who pitched his tent too close to Sodom, these bodies have
      camped too close to the gates of Rome. The true Christian conquers, not
      through the sign of a fiery cross or the charm of a jeweled crucifix, but
      through the Gospel of Christ, which is “the power of God unto salvation to
      every one that believeth” (Romans 1:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Scapulars. Another object of special devotion in the Roman Catholic Church
      is the scapular. This can best be described as a “charm” which is designed
      to give the wearer protection against all kinds of perils, such as
      accidents, disease, lightning, fire, and storms, and to ward off
      witchcraft and enchantments, and put evil spirits to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scapular was invented by Simon Stock, an English monk, in the year
      1287. According to tradition this holy man withdrew into a wood where he
      lived in great austerity for twenty years, at the end of which time the
      Virgin Mary appeared to him in celestial splendor, with thousands of
      angels, and, holding the scapular in her hand, commissioned him to take
      this as the sign of the Carmelite Order to which he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scapular consists of two pieces of brown cloth about four inches
      square, on which are pictures of the Virgin Mary, to be worn next to the
      skin, suspended over the shoulders by cords fore and back. Normally it
      must be of wool or other cloth, but not of silk, since it is worn in honor
      of the Virgin Mary and it is said that she never wore silk. It is to be
      worn day and night, never to be taken off until death, and it is good even
      to be buried with it. During the Second World War a metal scapular was
      supplied to Roman Catholic service men and was called the “Scapular
      Militia.” On one square were printed the words, “S. Simon Stock, pray for
      us,” and on the other, “Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, pray for us.”
    </p>
    <p>Paul Blanshard cites the following use (or misuse) of the scapular:</p>
    <p>
      “I have before me as I write a four page circular called The Scapular
      Militia , issued by the Carmelite National Shrine of Our Lady of Scapular,
      of 338 East 29 th St., New York. It bears the official Imprimatur of
      Archbishop [now Cardinal] Spellman, and it was issued at the height of the
      war in 1943. The slogan emblazoned on its cover is ‘A Scapular for Every
      Catholic Service Man,’ and it carries, underneath a picture of Mary,
      Joseph, and St. Simon Stock, the specific guaranty in heavy capitals:
      Whosoever dies clothed in this SCAPULAR SHALL NOT SUFFER eternal fire”
      (American Freedom and Catholic Power , p. 248).
    </p>
    <p>
      That, we assert, is pure fetishism, the same kind of thing practiced by
      primitive tribes in many pagan countries. By such means do priests (and
      cardinals) substitute charms and superstitions in place of the New
      Testament which contains no such deceptions.

    <h2>Relics, Pilgrimages</h2>
    <p>
      A relic is a piece of bone or other part of a saint’s body or some article
      which a saint touched during his life. Each of these supposedly has some
      degree of the supernatural attached to it and is regarded with more or
      less reverence, depending to a considerable extent on the education or
      lack of education of the worshipper. Such relics have an important place
      in the worship of the Roman Church. Paul Blanshard writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Many non-Catholics imagine that relics are used by Catholicism merely as
      symbols of faith and devotion. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
      The Church, even the American Church of the present day, still operates a
      full-blown system of fetishism and sorcery in which physical objects are
      supposed to accomplish physical miracles. Sometimes it is claimed that
      these physical objects also accomplish spiritual miracles and change the
      physical or spiritual destiny of any fortunate Catholic who relies on
      them” (Ibid. , p. 248).
    </p>
    <p>
      Relics range from pieces of the true cross, the nails, thorns from the
      crown of thorns, the seamless robe of Christ, the linen of Mary, her
      wedding ring, locks of her hair, vials of her milk, and her house
      miraculously transplanted from Palestine to Italy, to the more common and
      more abundant bones, arms, legs, hair, garments, and other possessions of
      the saints and martyrs. Many of the alleged relics have been proved false
      and have been dropped, but others continue to the present day. Some of the
      bones have been exposed as those of animals. In one instance the alleged
      bones of a famous Neapolitan saint, which it was claimed had worked
      countless miracles, were found to be those of a goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the actual cross on which Christ was crucified, the Catholic
      Encyclopedia says: “The so-called true cross of Christ was found in the
      mount Calvary by the mother of Constantine (in the fourth century), and
      taken to Jerusalem by Constantine himself’ (Vol. VIII, p. 238). But since
      that time hundreds of pieces of the true cross have been scattered over
      the earth for the veneration of superstitious Roman Catholics and for the
      enrichment of the clergy. Calvin wrote concerning the fragments of the
      cross alleged to exist in Roman churches in his day: “If all the pieces...
      were collected into a single heap, they would form a good shipload,
      although the Gospel testifies that a single individual was able to carry
      it! What effrontery, then, to fill the whole earth with fragments which it
      would take more than 300 men to carry.” St. Paulinus, one of the Roman
      Catholic apologists for the veneration and defense of relics, says that “a
      portion of the true cross kept at Jerusalem gave off fragments of itself
      without diminishing.” That would seem to be the only way in which the
      facts in question can be accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an abundance of nails from the true cross, and almost every city
      in Italy and France has one or two thorns from the true crown of thorns.
      Nearly every town in Sicily has one or mere teeth of Saint Agatha, the
      patron saint of the island. The multiplication of nearly every relic of
      primary interest should, of course, be sufficient to convince even the
      most credulous that these are nothing but pious frauds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A report in The Kansas City Star, September 21, 1959, said that the Holy
      Robe of Christ, in a glass-enclosed case, was displayed for the first time
      in 26 years in the cathedral at Trier, Germany, the oldest cathedral in
      Germany, that during the two months of its public viewing it drew
      1,800,000 pilgrims, and that the final display was attended by more than
      35,600 people including Cardinal Ottaviani, pro-secretary of the Holy
      Office at the Vatican. About ten years ago there was returned to this
      country an arm of Saint Francis Xavier, famous Spanish Jesuit missionary
      to the Orient in the 16 th century, which attracted large crowds at public
      showings in Los Angeles and other cities. In Spain there have been
      exhibited in different cathedrals two heads of John the Baptist, and in
      one of the cathedrals there is a magnificent ostrich feather preserved in
      a gorgeous case, which it is said fell from a wing of the angel Gabriel
      when he came to make the announcement to Mary. Perhaps the best known
      present day event in connection with any relic is that of the liquefaction
      of the blood of St. Januarius, patron saint of Naples, Italy, which we are
      told liquefies three times annually, proving that their saint still
      watches over the city. In Rome the Scala Sancta, the sacred stairway,
      exhibited as the one Jesus mounted going up to Pilate’s judgment hall, is
      crowded continually with devout pilgrims who climb the steps on their
      knees, saying a prayer on each step to gain indulgences. It will be
      recalled that this was the stairway that Martin Luther was climbing when
      there dawned upon him the truth of the words, “The just shall live by
      faith.” Luther arose from his knees, walked down the steps, and from that
      time did no more works of penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most intriguing of all relics is “the House of Mary,” or “the Holy House
      of Loretto,” in Italy. This house is said to have been the house of the
      Virgin Mary at Nazareth, in Palestine. It is a stone structure about
      twenty-eight feet long and twelve feet wide. A booklet purporting to give
      the authentic history of the house as sanctioned by the Roman Church is
      sold to visitors. The booklet says that in this simple apartment the
      Virgin Mary lived with Jesus until He grew to manhood and departed on His
      mission. After the crucifixion Mary continued to live in it until her
      death, visited frequently by the apostles and other disciples of Jesus.
      When Nazareth was plundered by the Roman soldiers the house was
      miraculously preserved in that the soldiers could not enter it or touch
      it. In 1291, when Palestine was overrun by the Saracens, so the booklet
      relates, the house was detached from its foundation by the angels, and was
      carried by them across the sea to Dalmatia, in Macedonia, where it was
      deposited on a hill. The Dalmatians gave it a friendly welcome, devoutly
      worshipped it, and for three years and seven months it was visited by many
      pilgrims. Then suddenly it removed and flew over the sea to eastern Italy,
      first coming to rest near the town of Loretto, about two miles from the
      coast. A few months later it removed again a short distance to its present
      home, on a hill in the town of Loretto, where it has been enshrined in a
      beautiful church. The Dalmatians lamented its departure, and for a long
      time in their prayers were wont to say: “Return to us, O beautiful lady;
      return to us, O beautiful lady; come back to us, O Mary, with your house.”
      But it would not come. In its present location it is visited by many
      pilgrims, some of whom climb the hill leading to it on their knees,
      kissing the stones of the walk as they move themselves forward. This same
      account regarding the house of Mary is recorded by Liguori in his book,
      The Glories of Mary, 1902 edition, pp. 72-73.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Standard International Encyclopedia says concerning the town of
      Loretto:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is noted as the seat of the Holy House, which according to tradition,
      was occupied as a dwelling by the Virgin Mary at Nazareth and, in 1295,
      was removed to Loretto. The building was originally of simple
      construction, but it has been adorned by marble sculptures. The town is
      visited annually by many tourists, who go there to view the structure and
      to witness an image of the Virgin which is reputed to be a carving by St.
      Luke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That the legend concerning the house now existing in Loretto is a mere
      fabrication should be clear on two points: (1) Some bricks in the
      structure were made in an oven, while in the time of Christ bricks were
      sun baked; (2) the house has a chimney, while the houses of Palestine did
      not have chimneys, the smoke escaping through holes in the sides or roofs
      of the buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a varied collection of relics the Roman Church maintains to assist
      the faithful of its members! The whole Roman Catholic world is full of
      frauds of this kind, exhibited as openly and as often as seems advisable.
      Every Roman Catholic church is supposed to have at least one relic. The
      only justification that the more intelligent Romanists can give for this
      situation is that it is justifiable to deceive the people for their own
      good. But as Dr. Woods has said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Church of Rome asserts that relics are intended ‘to excite good
      thoughts and increase devotion.’ But instead of doing this, for the most
      part they excite irreverent curiosity in careless sightseers, and disrupt
      true religion by exhibiting as genuine what men know to be counterfeit.
      The right way to ‘excite good thoughts and increase devotion’ is by the
      reverent study of God’s Word and prayer. The right way to honor a good man
      who has passed away, is not to venerate one of his bones, but to emulate
      his virtues in the service of God and our fellow men” ( Our Priceless
      Heritage, p. 169).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraud is practiced in the Roman Church not only in exhibiting relics of
      the saints, but also in attributing supernatural powers to them. Each time
      a new saint is canonized, the church comes into possession of a new
      collection of relics which are alleged to have performed miracles. All of
      this is on a par with the customs in the pagan religions. Interestingly
      enough, an AP dispatch from Kandy, Ceylon, published in The Kansas City
      Star, August 20, 1959, reported that a temple elephant had run amuck
      through Buddhist crowds during a ceremony at the Temple of the Holy Tooth,
      killing 20 people and injuring 250 others. The temple houses a tooth relic
      of the Buddha who founded that religion 25 centuries ago, and is
      considered one of the most sacred spots in Buddhism. The Roman devotion to
      sacred relics cannot be looked upon as one whit better than the same
      misguided devotion paid to relics in pagan temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many priests have little or no faith at all in relics, even though it is
      part of their work to recommend them and to supervise their use by the
      pious faithful. Priests who have been to Rome for any length of time lose
      any reverence they may have had for such things when they see the
      shameless traffic that is carried on in that city in bits of bones and
      pious objects of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazing thing about this whole business is that presumably intelligent
      and educated Roman Catholics, clerical and lay alike, even in an
      enlightened country such as the United States, either tacitly accept such
      relics as genuine or fail to denounce them for the gross superstition that
      they know them to be. Veneration of such articles is of the same order as
      that of the heathen who, in their blindness, “bow down to wood and stone.”
      The great lesson taught by the history of image worship and the
      reverencing of relics is the importance of adhering strictly to the Bible
      as the only rule of faith and practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closely akin to the subject of relics is that of “Holy Water,” so-called,
      which is nothing more than ordinary water with a pinch of salt added and
      blessed by a priest. A holy water font is found just inside the entrance
      in every Roman Catholic church. That is another empty superstition from
      the Dark Ages, borrowed from paganism, and introduced into the church in
      the ninth century. Pagan temples in Rome had holy water stoups or basins
      long before they were introduced into the Christian churches, and all of
      those entering were expected to sprinkle themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader has ever visited a Roman Catholic goods store he doubtless
      has seen the hundreds of statues of Mary and the saints on sale there, row
      on row, some highly ornamented and expensive, others quite plain, in
      various sizes and colors and prices. All of those are, or become, small
      Roman gods; for when blessed by the priest they are thought to have deep
      religious significance and are worshipped and given places of honor in the
      churches and homes. Then there are literally thousands of rosaries,
      crucifixes, crosses, sacred pictures, candlesticks, holy oils, incense,
      medals, and little charms and gadgets which the Roman Church blesses and
      encourages the people to use. For a Protestant it is a disturbing
      experience for he cannot help but feel that he is indeed in the house of
      the idols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilgrimages. Another characteristic of Romanism is the idea that special
      merit attaches to pilgrimages made to holy places. This too is an idea
      that was entirely foreign to first century Christianity. Most important of
      the pilgrimages in our day is that to Rome. And of course no one must go
      empty-handed. Pope Boniface VIII (died 1303) proclaimed a jubilee with
      plenary indulgences granted to all who visited Rome, and the project
      brought such crowds and such a great amount of money that it has been
      repeated periodically ever since, the most recent having been the Marian
      year proclaimed by Pope Pius XII, in 1954, this after having promulgated
      the doctrine of the assumption of Mary in 1950. During the Middle Ages
      much virtue was thought to attach to a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Plenary
      indulgences were offered to those who joined the Crusades in an attempt to
      wrest the Holy Lands from the Mohammedans. Pilgrimages have been much in
      vogue in pagan religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Mohammedanism
      (that to Mecca being the most famous), as a means of pleasing the god or
      gods who are worshipped and of accumulating merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Famous, too, as pilgrimage cities, are Lourdes, in extreme southwestern
      France, and Fatima, in Portugal. At Lourdes the Virgin Mary allegedly
      appeared to a 14-year-old peasant girl, Bernadette Soubirous, in 1858.
      When Bernadette dug in a certain place as commanded by Mary, a spring of
      water with curative powers was uncovered. The Basilica of the Rosary was
      later erected on the site and every year tens of thousands of pilgrims
      visit the place in search of cures. Thousands of cures have been claimed,
      but the Roman Church officially claims but very few. Hardly more than one
      person in a thousand is actually helped, and those frequently are
      psychological cures, on the order of those sometimes achieved by the
      Christian Scientists and other faith healers. Yet the Roman church
      promotes pilgrimages to Lourdes. The place is now highly commercialized,
      and directly and indirectly is a source of revenue for the church. We
      notice, however, that when a pope gets sick he does not go to Lourdes, but
      instead secures the best medical help available—as was the case with the
      late Pius XII.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years the shrine of Fatima, Portugal, has become even more
      popular than that at Lourdes, with as many as 700,000 people said to have
      visited it in a single month. There, in 1917, shortly before the Bolshevik
      revolution in Russia, the Virgin Mary appeared to three children, ages
      from ten to thirteen, who had never gone to school and, curiously enough,
      in messages subsequently released by the church, gave warnings against the
      evils of Communism, messages having more to do with present day relations
      between the Vatican and Russia than with anything that might be thought to
      concern children of those tender ages. Rome’s promotion of the Fatima
      shrine has been coupled with her crusade against Communism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our western world the two most important shrines are Our Lady of
      Guadalupe, on the outskirts of Mexico City, and Ste. Anne de Beaupre, in
      Quebec. After Cortez’ conquest of Mexico the Romanists practically forced
      their religion upon the Mexican people. Cortez and his soldiers took
      Mexico City. With them were a number of priests. Some of the Indians
      eventually were converted, despite the greed and cruelty of the Spanish
      soldiers. But not many could be persuaded to worship the Virgin Mary
      because she was not an Indian—hence the invention of “The Virgin of
      Guadalupe,” in reality a Mexican goddess who was absorbed into the Roman
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to tradition “The Virgin” appeared to Juan Diego, an uneducated
      Indian, who was one of the converts, and told him that the Indian people
      should build a temple in her honor and that she would be their protector.
      At first no one would believe his story. But an allegedly miraculous
      picture of the Virgin imprinted on his cloak proved convincing. A giant
      church eventually was erected in honor of the Virgin at the place where he
      had seen the vision. The cloak with its picture is still preserved in the
      church. All indications are, however, that priestly influence was behind
      the entire project, and that Juan Diego was merely its tool. At any rate,
      today thousands of Mexicans, some of whom “walk” on their knees for miles
      before reaching the church, visit the shrine to bow to the image of the
      Virgin and to those of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrine of Ste. Anne de Beaupre is located on the north bank of the St.
      Lawrence River, about 20 miles northeast of the city of Quebec. It was
      dedicated to Saint Anne, who according to early legend was the mother of
      Mary. It is visited annually by thousands from the United States and
      Canada. Large numbers of crutches and canes are exhibited, allegedly left
      by cripples who received miraculous cures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religious parades or processions are common to all Roman Catholic
      countries. In Spain they have the procession in which the image of the
      ‘Senor Jesus del Gran Poder” is paraded; and in Portugal that of the Senor
      de los Pasos.” In Peru they have the procession of “The Lord of Miracles,”
      in which a large image of Jesus is carried through the streets, to which
      the people give special veneration and of which they ask all kinds of
      favors— healings, success in business, happiness in love, luck in the
      lottery, etc. Thousands of people participate in these parades, carrying
      burning tapers, counting their rosaries, forming a guard of honor for the
      painted and clothed images. But such images and parades are totally
      ineffective in teaching anything about Christ and the way of salvation,
      for the people know practically nothing about who He is or what He taught.

<div id="Prayers" dropdownName="Prayers for Dead" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>Prayers for the Dead</h2>
    <p>
      A common practice in the Roman Church is that of praying for the dead.
      This is closely connected with and is a logical consequence of their
      doctrine of purgatory. The high Anglican Church, which holds a position
      about half way between Roman Catholicism and representative Protestantism,
      also follows that custom. But practically all Protestant churches reject
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prayers for the dead imply that their state has not yet been fixed, and
      that it can be improved at our request. We hold, however, that there is no
      change of character or of destiny after death, and that what the person is
      at death he remains throughout all eternity. We find an abundance of
      Scripture teaching to the effect that this world only is the place of
      opportunity for salvation, and that when this probation or testing period
      is past, only the assignment of rewards and punishments remains.
      Consequently we hold that all prayers, baptisms, masses, or other rituals
      of whatever kind for the dead are superfluous, vain, and unscriptural.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the righteous dead, they are in the immediate presence of Christ,
      in a perfect environment of holiness and beauty and glory where their
      every need is satisfied. They have no need of any petitions from us. They
      lack nothing that our prayers can supply. Their state is as perfect as it
      can be until the day when they and we receive our resurrected bodies. To
      petition God to change the status or condition of His loved ones in glory,
      or to suggest that He is not doing enough for them, is, to say the least,
      highly presumptuous, even though it may be well intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      At for the wicked dead, their state too is fixed and irrevocable. They
      have had their opportunity. They have sinned away their day of grace, and
      the uplifting and restraining influence of the Holy Spirit as directed
      toward them has been withdrawn. It is understandable that remaining
      relatives and friends should be concerned about them. But the
      determination of their status after death is the prerogative of God alone.
      The holiness and justice of God are all-sufficient guarantees that while
      some by His grace will be rewarded far above their deserts, none will be
      punished beyond their deserts. Consequently, the dead in Christ have no
      need of our prayers; and for the dead out of Christ, prayers can avail
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very significant that in Scripture we have not one single instance
      of prayer for the dead, nor any admonition to that end. In view of the
      many admonitions for prayer for those in this world, even admonitions to
      pray for our enemies, the silence of Scripture regarding prayer for the
      dead would seem to be unexplainable if it availed anything.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      Such is the background of ritualism and superstition against which the
      Roman Catholic people have to struggle. Forms and ceremonies and rich
      clerical vestments impress the eye, but they deaden the soul to spiritual
      truth. They are like opiates in that they take the attention of the
      worshipper and cause him to forget the truths they were originally
      intended to convey. By absorbing his attention they tend to hide God
      rather than to reveal Him. And the people, like wide-eyed children at a
      circus, see the showy ritualism but nothing of the shoddy meanness that
      lies behind it.

      Most Roman Catholics have a fear of entering a Protestant church. They
      have been forbidden by their priests to do so, under penalty of mortal
      sin. It is a revealing experience, therefore, when for the first time they
      are persuaded to do so. They find no images, no musing angels, no
      confessional, no incense, no mention of purgatory or of salvation by good
      works, no penance, indulgences, etc. Instead they hear the simple Gospel
      message and a plain invitation to accept Christ as Savior. The sermon is
      delivered in English, not in Latin which they cannot understand, as in the
      mass. And with a minimum of ritualism, they find that the sermon is the
      principal part of the service. How rich they find the hymnology of the
      Protestant church, and how free and spontaneous the singing! The Roman
      Church has nothing to sing about. The best it can promise is the flames of
      purgatory, of greater or lesser intensity and of longer or shorter
      duration, depending on how good or bad their works have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multitudes of Roman Catholics, ensnared in a religion that teaches
      salvation by works and merit, are searching for the truth that makes men
      free. Protestantism has that truth, due largely to its emphasis on the
      reading and study of the Bible. That truth is set forth as a life to be
      lived, not as a formula or a ritual. Its emphasis is upon a change of
      heart and a life of fruitful service. It behooves us as Protestants,
      therefore, to see to it that when Roman Catholics do come to our churches,
      where they miss the ritual and pageantry and the outward things that so
      appeal to the senses, they find compensating values—first of all an
      evangelical sermon, and then a group fellowship that is spiritually
      uplifting and rewarding beyond anything that they have experienced in the
      more formal church.
