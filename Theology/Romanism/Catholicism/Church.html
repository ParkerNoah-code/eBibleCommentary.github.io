      The Bible teaches that Christ founded His church, the Christian church,
      and that He is both the foundation on which it rests, and the head of the
      church which is His body: “For other foundation can no man lay than that
      which is laid, which is Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 3:11); “...being
      built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
      himself being the chief comer stone” (Ephesians 2:20); “And he put all
      things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all
      things to the church, which is his body” (Ephesians 1:22-23); “...Christ
      also is the head of the church” (Ephesians 5:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      The church is composed of all who are true Christians, those who have been
      “bom again,” or “bom anew” (John 3:3), from all nations and denominations.
      Local “churches of Christ” (Romans 16:16) are congregations of Christians
      who gather together for worship and for missionary activity. And, while
      they are many, they are all members of the one church of Christ: “For even
      as we have many members in one body... so we, being many, are one body in
      Christ” (Romans 12:4-5). This is the true church.
    </p>
    <p>
      A truly broad and charitable definition of the church is given for
      example, in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which says: “The visible
      church, which is also catholic or universal under the gospel (not confined
      to one nation, as before under the law), consists of all those throughout
      the world, that profess the true religion, together with their children;
      and is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God,
      out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation” (XXV:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Larger Catechism, in answer to the question, “What is the visible
      church?” (Q. 62), says: “The visible church is a society made up of all
      such as in all ages and places of the world do profess the true religion,
      and of their children.”
    </p>
    <p>The marks of a true church are:</p>
    <p>The true preaching of the Word of God.</p>
    <p>The right administration of the sacraments. And,</p>
    <p>The faithful exercise of discipline.</p>
    <p>
      John Calvin insisted repeatedly on “the ministry of the Word and
      sacraments” as the distinguishing marks of a true church. To these are
      generally added the exercise of proper discipline, although minor errors
      and irregularities of conduct do not in themselves give sufficient cause
      to withhold acknowledgment of a true church. Dr. Louis Berkhof says
      concerning the faithful exercise of discipline: “This is quite essential
      for maintaining the purity of doctrine and for guarding the holiness of
      the sacraments. Churches that are lax in discipline are bound to discover
      sooner or later within their circle an eclipse of the light of the truth
      and an abuse of that which is holy” (Systematic Theology, p. 578).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bible the word “church” never means a denomination. The Bible has
      nothing to say about denominations. Whether a local church chooses to
      remain strictly independent, or to enter into a working agreement with one
      or more other local churches, and if so on what terms, is not discussed in
      Scripture, but is left entirely to the choice of the church itself. And we
      find that in actual practice churches range all the way from those that
      remain entirely unrelated to any other, to the other extreme of those that
      subject themselves to some hierarchy of denominational overlords who own
      the property and send the minister. Surely the local church should own the
      building and grounds that it has developed and paid for. Such ownership
      serves as a shield against undue denominational pressure being brought to
      bear upon it. And, as it has the right to decide whether or not it will
      join a denomination, so it should have the right to withdraw from the
      denomination if it so chooses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually the word “church,” as used in the New Testament, means a local
      congregation of Christians, such as “the church of God at Corinth,” “the
      church in Jerusalem,” “the churches of Galatia,” “the church in thy
      house.” At other times it may refer to the church at large, as when we are
      told that “Christ loved the church, and gave himself up for it” (Ephesians
      5:25). Or again it may refer to the whole body of Christ in all ages, as
      when we read of “the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are
      enrolled in heaven” (Hebrews 12:23). When our Lord prayed for unity, “that
      they may all be one” (John 17:21), it was primarily a spiritual unity, a
      oneness of heart and faith, of love and obedience, of true believers, and
      only secondarily a unity of ecclesiastical organization, that He had in
      mind, as is made clear by the fact that He illustrated that unity by the
      relationship which exists between Himself and the Father—“even as thou.
      Father, art in me, and I in thee.” Unity of faith must be achieved before
      there can be unity of organization. The ideal, of course, would be for the
      church to be one in both faith and organization. But it clearly is not yet
      ready for that. Much work remains to be done in teaching God’s Word before
      that can be accomplished. As Christians become more closely united in
      doctrine they work together more harmoniously and want to be united more
      closely in organization. But unity of doctrine must always remain primary,
      for that relates to the very purpose for which the church was founded. The
      alleged tragedy of disunity of organization is more than offset by the
      real tragedy of disunity of doctrine that results when conservative and
      modernistic churches are combined in one organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just here that the Romanists, who claim to be the only true church,
      err in attempting to bring all churches, even to force all churches, into
      one external and mechanical organization. The oneness for which Christ
      prayed was not external and visible, but spiritual and invisible. There
      can be and actually is real spiritual unity among Christians apart from
      organizational unity. The church is not a mechanism, but a living
      organism, whose head is Christ; and any unity that is mechanical and
      forced is bound to hinder the very thing that it is designed to promote.
      When we hear the pope and occasionally other church leaders talk about
      uniting all churches into one super organization, the words they employ
      and their method of approach make it clear that what they have in mind is
      not a spiritual unity of believers but an ecclesiastical and mechanical
      unity of believers and unbelievers, designed primarily for what they think
      would be greater efficiency of operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, perhaps the diversity of churches, with a healthy spirit
      of rivalry within proper limits, is one of God’s ways of keeping the
      stream of Christianity from becoming stagnant. History is quite clear in
      showing that where there has been enforced uniformity the church has
      stagnated, whether in Italy, Spain, France, or Latin America. The
      confinement of religious life to a dead level of uniformity does not solve
      our problems.

    <h2>“Catholic”</h2>
    <p>
      Something should be said concerning the meaning of the term “catholic,”
      which the Roman Church tries to appropriate exclusively to itself. Dr. J.
      G. Vos, editor of Blue Banner Faith and Life , gives this definition: “The
      Catholic Church: The universal church of God, as distinguished from a
      particular branch, congregation or denomination of that church.” “The
      Church of Rome,” he continues, “has wrongly appropriated to itself the
      term ‘Catholic’; it is self-contradictory to call a body ‘Roman’ (which is
      particular) and at the same time ‘Catholic’ (which means universal).”
    </p>
    <p>
      A Catholic Dictionary gives this definition: “ Catholic . The word is
      derived from the Greek, and simply means universal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. John H. Gerstner, Professor of Church History in Pittsburgh
      Theological Seminary, in a booklet, The Gospel According to Rome , says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strictly speaking ‘Roman Catholic’ is a contradiction of terms. Catholic
      means universal; Roman means particular. It is the Protestant and not the
      Romanist who believes in the catholic church. Protestants believe the
      church is universal or catholic; Rome cannot discover it beyond her own
      communion. Our formula is: ‘Ubi Spiritus ibi ecclesia’ —‘Where the Spirit
      is there is the church.’ Her motto is: ‘Ubi ecclesia ibi Spiritus’ —‘Where
      the (Roman) church is there is the Spirit.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is because of the proper historic use of the word ‘catholic’ that
      Protestants do not hesitate to recite it in the Apostles’ Creed. We cling
      to the word because we cherish the concept. Rome has no monopoly on it;
      indeed, as we have suggested, it is a question whether she has any right
      to it” (p. 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      All those who believe in Christ as Savior, regardless of what denomination
      they belong to, are in fact members of the Christian catholic church.
      Evangelical Protestants are the truest “catholics,” for they base their
      faith on the New Testament as did the early Christians. The Roman Church
      has added many doctrines and practices that are not found in the New
      Testament, and anyone who accepts those becomes, to that extent, a Roman
      catholic, and by the same token ceases to be a Christian catholic. Since
      the word “catholic” means “universal,” the true Christian catholic church
      must include all true believers, all who belong to the mystical or
      spiritual body of Christ (“the church, which is his body”—Ephesians
      1:22-23). But there have been, and are, millions of Christians who have
      never had any connection with the Roman church. The Roman Church, is,
      after all, a local church, with headquarters in Rome, Italy and is limited
      to those who acknowledge the authority of the pope. Even in her most
      extravagant claims the Roman Church claims only about one in eight of the
      population of the world, and in the professedly Christian world she has
      cut herself off from and broken communion with perhaps more than half of
      Christendom, so that there are probably more professed Christians who
      reject her authority than acknowledge it. And geographically she fails
      utterly to prove her claim to universality. Even in the nominally Roman
      Catholic countries such as Italy, France, Spain, and Latin America, Rome
      today probably does not have effective control of more than fifteen
      percent of the people. In any event the Roman Church clearly is not
      universal, but is only one among numerous others and is outnumbered by the
      effective membership of the various Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
      churches.
    </p>
    <p>Bishop J. C. Ryle, of Liverpool (England), has well said:</p>
    <p>
      “There are many ‘churches,’ but in the New Testament only one true church
      is recognized. This true church is composed of all believers in the Lord
      Jesus. It is made up of God’s elect—of all converted men and women—of all
      true Christians. It is a church of which all the members are born again of
      the Holy Spirit. They all possess repentance toward God, faith toward our
      Lord Jesus Christ, and holiness of life and conversation. They all draw
      their religion from one single book—the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the church whose existence does not depend on forms, ceremonies,
      cathedrals, churches, vestments, organs, or any act or favor whatever from
      the hand of man. It has often lived on and continued when all these things
      have been taken from it. This is the universal church of the Apostles’
      Creed, and of the Nicene Creed. This is the only church which is truly
      universal. Its members are found in every part of the world where the
      Gospel is received and believed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rev. Stephen L. Testa, a former Roman Catholic, and founder of The
      Scripture Truth Society, has said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Lord Jesus Christ founded His church (Matthew 16:18), which was
      evangelical Christian. He was to be the Head, the Holy Spirit the Guide,
      and the Bible the only rule of faith and practice. It was made up of His
      followers who were born again and pledged to continue His work of
      redemption in the world. It was catholic in that it was designed for all
      the people of the earth. The church remained pure and faithful Gospel for
      to the about 300 years, which was the golden age of martyrs and saints,
      who were persecuted by pagan Rome. After the so-called conversion of
      emperor Constantine (a.d. 310) Christianity was declared the state
      religion, and multitudes of pagans were admitted to the church by baptism
      alone, without conversion. They brought with them their pagan rites,
      ceremonies and practices which they gradually introduced into the church
      with Christian names, all of which corrupted the primitive faith, and the
      church became Romanized and paganized. What makes a church truly catholic
      is its adherence to the Gospel of Christ and the Apostles’ Creed. The
      Roman Church has added popery and so many other pagan doctrines and
      practices that many people think it no longer either Christian or
      catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Reformation of the 16 th century was a protest against those pagan
      doctrines, a wholesale withdrawal from the official church and a return to
      the primitive catholic Christianity of the New Testament. The Roman Church
      today can become again a truly catholic church by renouncing popery and
      those dogmas and practices which are contrary to the Word of God and
      holding fast to its primitive foundation, on which basis the reunion of
      all Christian churches could be realized. The name ‘catholic,’ when
      applied to the Roman Church exclusively, is a misnomer, for it befits
      better those Protestant churches which hold fast to the Bible and the
      Apostles’ Creed without any additions whatever. ‘For I testify unto every
      man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall
      add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in
      this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
      this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out
      of the holy city, which are written in this book’ (Revelation 22:18-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      “The true church of Christ is invisible, made up of truly converted people
      who are to be found in all the visible churches and whose names are
      written in heaven, and the visible churches exist to train saints for the
      kingdom of Christ” (booklet, Is Romanism in the Bible? p. 3).

<div id="Sect" dropdownName="Sect" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>What is a “Sect”?</h2>
    <p>
      Another trait of the Roman Church is her attempt to brand all other church
      groups as “sects,” and as schismatic. First, let us fix clearly in mind
      precisely what a “sect” is. Dictionary definitions tend to emphasize the
      divisive, schismatic, heretical elements in defining a sect. Hence we
      would define a sect as a group that shuts itself in as God’s exclusive
      people, and shuts all others out. By its exclusiveness a sect cuts itself
      off and isolates itself from the main stream of Christian life. On that
      basis the Roman Church, with its bigoted and offensive claim to be “the
      only true church,” its readiness to brand all others as heretics, its
      anathemas or curses so readily pronounced against all who dare to differ
      with its pronouncements, and its literally dozens of heresies and
      practices which are not found in the New Testament, automatically brands
      itself as the biggest and most prominent of all the sects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sectarianism is shown, for instance, in statements such as the
      Syllabus of Errors, issued by Pope Pius IX, in 1864, and still in full
      force where the Roman Church can enforce its will. The hierarchy in the
      United States plays down this Syllabus, and for many years has conducted a
      subtle campaign designed to hide many of its distinctive doctrines and so
      to gain favor with the American public. But here are its claims in plain
      language. Some of the most distinctive articles in their affirmative form
      are:
    </p>
    <p>
      15. “No man is free to embrace and profess that religion which he believes
      to be true, guided by the light of reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      17. “The eternal salvation of any out of the true church of Christ is not
      even to be hoped for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      18. “Protestantism is not another and diversified form of the one true
      Christian religion in which it is possible to please God equally as in the
      Catholic Church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      21. “The Church has power to define dogmatically the religion of the
      Catholic Church to be the only true religion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      24. “The Church has the power of employing force and (of exercising)
      direct and indirect temporal power.”
    </p>
    <p>
      37. “No national Church can be instituted in a state of division and
      separation from the authority of the Roman Pontiff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      42. “In legal conflict between Powers (Civil and Ecclesiastical) the
      Ecclesiastical Law prevails.”
    </p>
    <p>
      45. “The direction of Public Schools in which the youth of Christian
      states are brought up... neither can nor ought to be assumed by the Civil
      Authority alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      48. “Catholics cannot approve of a system of education for youth apart
      from the Catholic faith, and disjoined from the authority of the Church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      54. “Kings and Princes [including, of course, Presidents, Prime Ministers,
      etc.] are not only not exempt from the jurisdiction of the Church, but are
      subordinate to the Church in litigated questions of jurisdiction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      55. “The Church ought to be in union with the State, and the State with
      the Church.”
    </p>
    <p>
      57. “Philosophical principles, moral science, and civil laws may and must
      be made to bend to Divine and Ecclesiastical authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      63. “Subjects may not refuse obedience to legitimate princes, much less
      rise in insurrection against them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      67. “The marriage tie is indissoluble by the law of nature; divorce,
      properly so called, cannot in any case be pronounced by the civil
      authority.”
    </p>
    <p>
      73. “Marriage among Christians cannot be constituted by any civil
      contract; the marriage-contract among Christians must always be a
      sacrament; and the contract is null if the sacrament does not exist.”
    </p>
    <p>
      77. “It is necessary even in the present day that the Catholic religion
      shall be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all
      other forms of worship.”
    </p>
    <p>
      78. “Whence it has been unwisely provided by law, in some countries called
      Catholic, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the free
      exercise of their religion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      80. “The Roman Pontiff cannot and ought not to reconcile himself to, or
      agree with. Progress, Liberalism, and Modern Civilization.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These statements are from the pope who just six years later established
      the doctrine of papal infallibility! The Roman Church here condemns
      freedom of religion, freedom of speech and of the press, the separation of
      church and state; asserts the authority of the church over the state and
      of the pope over civil rulers, the right of the church to direct all
      education, the right of the church to suppress other faiths; condemns the
      public school system, and many other things which are integral parts of
      our American way of life. Let no one say that this Syllabus of Errors
      belongs to a former age and that it is not to be taken seriously. Even
      today it forms a part of the ordination vows of every Roman Catholic
      priest in the world. Every priest takes an oath on the Bible that he
      believes and will defend the eighty articles of this Syllabus. No part of
      it has ever been repudiated. Hence it contains official Roman Catholic
      doctrine. With the church committed to this Syllabus, how can anyone at
      one and the same time be a member of the Roman Catholic Church and a loyal
      American citizen ?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Syllabus the Roman Church displays a bitter, sectarian spirit in
      its relations with other churches. In every local community Roman Catholic
      priests refuse to join ministerial associations or to cooperate with
      ministers from other churches in any form of religious observances, and
      they not infrequently refuse to cooperate even in non-religious community
      projects.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand most Protestant churches are remarkably free from
      sectarianism. Most of them take a broad, tolerant attitude in
      acknowledging as true Christians any of their fellow men who base their
      hope for salvation on faith in Christ and live a good Christian life—in
      which case, as we have just seen, they are “catholic,” ecumenical in the
      best sense of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be charitably assumed that there are good Christians in all
      denominations, including the Roman Catholic. For any one branch of the
      church to claim that those within its fold alone constitute the body of
      true Christians is both crude and impudent, and is inconsistent with the
      principles of love and charity so clearly commanded in the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intolerance and sectarianism of Romanism is also shown in her attempt
      to use the word “church” for herself alone, as a synonym for the Roman
      Catholic Church, thereby unchurching all others, and by referring to
      Protestants as “non-Catholics.” Protestants are too lax in allowing the
      Roman Church to deprecate them with terminology which implies that they
      have no place in the church universal. The correct meaning of the term
      “church” and “catholic” should be pointed out, and doctrinal and
      historical evidence cited to show that the Roman Church herself is the
      church of schism and innovation, that by adding a host of unscriptural
      doctrines she has departed from the simplicity of the Gospel and from
      apostolic practice. It can be shown that more than half of Rome’s present
      creed was unknown to the early church. Consequently, she has neither the
      moral nor the logical right to appropriate to herself the terms “church”
      and “catholic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We suspect that it is just because the Roman Church knows that so much of
      her doctrine and so many of her practices are unscriptural or
      anti-Scriptural that as a matter of selfdefense she attempts to
      appropriate these terms to herself. A more appropriate name for this
      church, one that we have used frequently, is, the Roman Church, or the
      Church of Rome. These terms are accurate, and moreover they are terms
      which appear frequently in her own literature, written by representative
      Roman Catholics. Hence Protestants do that church no injustice in speaking
      of it under these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in its official title—the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic
      Church—the Roman Church seeks to appropriate the word “apostolic.” But
      again she has no right to call herself apostolic, since she bears so
      little resemblance to that church, more than half of her present doctrines
      and practices being unknown to the apostolic church. She applies to
      herself the term “holy,” but the fact is that through the ages and in her
      official capacity the Roman Church has been guilty of the most atrocious
      crimes, practiced in the name of religion, including murder, robbery,
      persecution of all kinds, bribery, fraud, deception, and practically every
      other crime known to man. Such crimes have been practiced not merely by
      church members, but by popes, cardinals, bishops, and priests who, as a
      study of church history will show, undeniably were evil men. Those crimes
      still are practiced where the Roman Church is attempting to suppress
      Protestantism—in Colombia, for instance, since 1948, when the liberal
      government was overthrown and a new government came into power with the
      support of the Roman Catholic Church and a concordat with the Vatican, 116
      Protestant Christians have been killed because of their faith, 66
      Protestant churches or chapels have been destroyed by fire or bombing,
      over 200 Protestant schools have been closed, and Protestant work of any
      kind forbidden in approximately two thirds of the country which has been
      designated “mission territory” (see Report of the Evangelical
      Confederation of Colombia, Bulletin No. 50, June 26, 1959).

      The assumption of Roman Catholic writers that theirs is the true church,
      and that it is the same orthodox, martyr, missionary church of apostolic
      times is manifestly false. The claim that the popes are in the direct line
      of succession from St. Peter—even if such a claim could be proved, which
      it cannot—would mean but little without imitation of the lives of the
      apostles and conformity to their doctrines. Jeremiah rebuked the foolish
      confidence of the Jews in his day who cried, “The temple of Jehovah, the
      temple of Jehovah... are these” (7:4), and called on them rather to prove
      their devotion to God with righteous and holy living. Caiaphas was in the
      line of Aaron and was the successor of many pious priests, but that did
      not make him and the Jews who crucified Jesus the true church. John Calvin
      called the Church of Rome in his day a foul harlot rather than the spouse
      of Christ, because of the low moral standard practiced and tolerated by
      her priests. Her pretensions to be the true church of Christ were shown by
      her actions to be false. How could she be the kingdom of Christ when her
      way of life was at such variance with His Word?
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup> Since the Second Vatican Council the priests have been given
      more freedom to cooperate with other ministers and to take part in some
      community projects.

    <h2>Church Government</h2>
    <p>
      As Protestants we believe in and practice democracy in Church government
      as well as in state government. We have local organizations in which
      ministers and laymen with equal voting rights handle local church
      problems, and for the denominations at large, general assemblies or
      conventions or conferences, composed of ministers and elders, usually in
      equal numbers, who are the elected representatives of the churches. Both
      the New Testament and the history of the church during the first four or
      five centuries make it abundantly clear that Christianity is essentially
      democratic in tendency. That tendency becomes manifest wherever the
      spiritual life of the church is free to assert itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament church was an organized band of baptized believers
      practicing New Testament ordinances and actively engaged in carrying out
      the Great Commission. Of that organization Christ alone was the Head.
      Believers were related to Him and to each other as members of the body.
      Each local church appears to have been a self-governing body. As the
      church in Jerusalem grew and needed more organization, that was provided,
      not by hierarchical appointment, but in a democratic way without
      consulting any other church. We read: “The twelve called the multitude of
      the disciples unto them, and said, “...Look ye out therefore, brethren,
      from among you seven men of good report” (Acts 6:2-3). There was no
      dictation by Peter, nor by any other apostle, nor by the apostles as a
      group. Rather it was “the multitude of the disciples,” that is, the
      membership of the church, who made the decision. Likewise, the church at
      Antioch sent out missionaries from its own membership (in this instance,
      Paul and Barnabas), without seeking permission or advice from any other
      body (Acts 13:1-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the New Testament churches were autonomous, there were certain
      ties which bound them together, such as that of maintaining doctrinal
      purity, for which purpose the Jerusalem conference was assembled (Acts
      15:1-29), that of ministering to the material needs of the saints in
      sister churches in time of crisis (Acts 11:27-30, 2 Corinthians 9:1-5),
      and a fellowship of worship (Acts 2:46-47, 20:6-7; Hebrews 10:25). A study
      of the church as it is set forth in the New Testament shows that it was
      absolutely dependent upon the Word of God for its existence. It was,
      therefore, completely subordinate to that authority in matters of
      doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact of the matter is that we are told but very little about the
      organization of the early church or about the relations that existed
      between the various bodies, no doubt because the new congregations started
      in an elementary way and the problems that developed within the
      congregations or between congregations depended upon local circumstances.
      Elders were appointed in all the churches, and these had the general
      oversight of their respective churches as regarded teaching, preaching,
      and the administration of congregational affairs, including their
      relations with other congregations. We are inclined to believe that the
      early church was neither Episcopal, nor Presbyterian, nor Congregational,
      but a combination of all three, and that local churches then as now may
      have differed considerably in their manner of government. In any event it
      is quite clear that the Roman Catholic Church, with its hierarchical form
      of government, was not the New Testament church, for the institution of
      the papacy, with a sacrificing priesthood, did not develop until some five
      centuries later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spurious logic of the hierarchy through which it lays claim to supreme
      authority over all Christians finds no support in Scripture. In fact the
      idea of a totalitarian church in which the layman has no vote and no voice
      in the formulation of doctrines, laws, and policies, a church in which he
      is told what to believe and what to do but in which he is never invited to
      discuss or help work out those beliefs and practices, seems to be the
      extreme opposite of that set forth in the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a basic tenet of Protestantism that the Word of God as given in the
      Scriptures is to be put into the language of the people and that it is
      sufficiently clear so that the individual Christian has a responsibility
      to read and to think for himself. He has the right of private judgment in
      spiritual affairs. He cannot surrender his conscience to the church or to
      a priest, but must think, speak, worship, and act in such a manner that he
      can give an account to God for what he is and does. This does not mean
      that he is to ignore the teaching of the church or the rich heritage of
      theological knowledge that has been accumulated over the centuries. Rather
      within proper limits he will seek the fellowship of the church with its
      accumulated wisdom and will further his spiritual life in that atmosphere
      of mutual love and helpfulness which comes through association with other
      Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the typical Roman Catholic countries the essence of the church is
      composed of the bishops and priests, to the exclusion of the laity which,
      while expected to provide the financial support, is kept in the dark and
      in abject subservience to a power-hungry hierarchy. The lay people are
      purely passive in the life of their church; they have no say in the choice
      of their priests and almost no say in the administration of the material
      possessions of the church. Very little emphasis, if indeed any at all, is
      placed on Bible study. Instead, moral standards are inflexibly set by the
      church. The individual must submit his conscience and his intelligence to
      this external authority, which tells him what is right and what is wrong.
      From childhood he is trained to accept the domination of the priest over
      the whole realm of his moral, social, and political life. He is told what
      to do and how to do it, even as regards personal and family affairs.
      Needless to say, not all Roman Catholics obey these dictates, particularly
      if they have some contact with Protestant ideals of freedom of religion
      and conduct. But the attitude of subservience is the ideal which the
      hierarchy seeks to maintain in its people. Few Roman Catholics, even in a
      Protestant country such as the United States, realize what a great debt
      they owe to Protestantism. Instead they support their church in fighting
      Protestantism.

<div id="Politics" dropdownName="Politics" style="display: none">
  <section>
    <h2>The Church in Politics</h2>
    <p>
      The Protestant ideal is that church leaders and church assemblies are
      altogether distinct from the civil magistracy, and that they have no
      jurisdiction whatever in civil and political affairs. It is, however, the
      duty of the church to teach her people, through her ministry and laity,
      their duties in the state as Christians. Her ministry as regards the state
      focuses at that point, and stops right there. She does not seek to become
      a political power rivaling the state, nor to become a state within a
      state. She must not allow herself to be used as a pressure group for the
      securing of certain rights and temporal benefits for men, nor to pressure
      the state for reform measures, even though such reforms may be needed and
      desirable from the Christian viewpoint. Christians as individuals are
      indeed to work for whatever reforms may be needed. But the church is not
      to do so in her corporate capacity. Such action on the part of the church
      almost invariably will detract from her primary mission of the
      proclamation of the Gospel and ministering to the spiritual needs of men,
      and will tend to give people a wrong conception as to what her true
      mission really is. And finally, she must not pressure the state for public
      funds to support her local churches, schools, and other institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Confession of Faith sets forth the role of the church in
      these words: “Synods and councils are to handle or conclude nothing, but
      that which is ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil
      affairs which concern the commonwealth unless by way of humble petition in
      cases extraordinary; or by way of advice for satisfaction of conscience,
      if they be thereunto required by the civil magistrate” (XXXI:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Protestantism asks nothing of the state except such liberty and
      independence as it already enjoys in most Protestant countries, and which,
      chiefly through Protestant influence, the Roman Catholic Church also
      enjoys in those same countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost total contrast with this, the Roman Catholic Church seeks to
      exert a controlling influence in both the church and the state. This has
      been well expressed by Avro Manhattan, a critic of Romanism, in The
      Vatican in World Politics:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The better to exert its double activity (religious and political), the
      Catholic Church has two facets: first, the religious institution, the
      Catholic Church itself; secondly, the political power, the Vatican.
      Although they deal separately, whenever convenient, with problems
      affecting religion and politics, the two are in reality one. At the head
      of both stands the pope, who is the supreme religious leader of the
      Catholic Church as a purely spiritual power, as well as the supreme head
      of the Vatican in its quality of a world-wide diplomatic-political center
      and an independent sovereign state” (p. 19; Gaer Associates, New York;
      1949).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church is both a church and a political system. As such
      it attempts to exert its influence in every sphere of human activity,
      expediency alone determining whether it moves as a religious institution
      or as a political institution. These activities may be exercised
      separately or in unison, depending on the purpose to be accomplished and
      the type of people with whom it has to deal. On the lower level, through
      its local congregations, it presents itself as a religious organization,
      and its appeals for money and support and public trust are made on that
      basis. But in its higher branches, as its influence is exerted through the
      hierarchy, it becomes increasingly a political organization, until in the
      Vatican it is concerned almost exclusively with political affairs and
      seeks to exert a controlling influence over the affairs of nations. It has
      a Papal Secretary of State who visits other governments and functions in
      much the same way that our American Secretary of State functions in
      Washington. It sends ambassadors and ministers to other nations, and
      receives ambassadors and ministers from other nations. All of this
      political activity is, of course, utterly without Scriptural support, and
      is in fact contrary to what the New Testament teaches concerning the
      nature and purpose of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Stanley Lowell, associate director of Protestants and Other Americans
      United for Separation of Church and State, has recently said: “The fact is
      that the Vatican is a state-church hybrid which alternately poses as a
      church and as a state depending on which will prove the more profitable at
      the moment. The Vatican claims all prerogatives as a state, but denies all
      responsibility as a state because it is a church” (Christianity Today,
      February 1, 1960).
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe this activity there has been coined a word, “clericalism,”
      meaning the organized political power of the higher clergy exerted in the
      affairs of a nation. This preoccupation of the hierarchy with temporal
      affairs has led some to declare, with good reason, that the Roman Church
      is not a church at all, but primarily a government, a political-commercial
      system which cloaks itself with religion to give it an air of
      respectability. The fact is that the Roman Catholic Church professes to be
      a state, without accepting the responsibilities of a state government; and
      at the same time it professes to be a church, without accepting the
      limitations which the New Testament sets for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      This double function has led to the conception of the Roman Church as an
      institution needing rulers after the manner of the state. Hence the
      concentration of power in the hands of the priests, bishops, and
      particularly in the hands of the pope as the coordinator of this vast
      world system, and the blind obedience expected from the laity in all
      countries to a foreign potentate of a clerical-fascist state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A specific example of what papal control can mean is seen in the issuance
      of a directive, in April, 1958, by the pope to all Roman Catholics in
      Italy, just prior to the election in that country, forbidding them to vote
      for any party or candidates not favored by the Roman Catholic church and
      declaring that anyone who did so vote would be subject to excommunication.
      The important thing about that directive is the principle involved. If the
      pope can issue a political order telling the Roman Catholics in Italy how
      to vote, he can do the same thing to those in the United States or in any
      other country. They all owe him the same kind and degree of obedience. The
      pope himself, of course, is the judge as to what parties or candidates are
      “Communistic” or otherwise not acceptable to the Roman Church. In Latin
      America Roman Catholic propaganda has long sought to identify Protestants
      and Communists as one and the same. That again serves as a clear warning
      as to what can happen here if Romanism comes into a position of dominance.

    <h2>A Church Under Foreign Control</h2>
    <p>
      It has been 186 years since the United States gained her independence.
      While all other American churches that were in existence at that time have
      long since been granted their independence or have declared their
      independence from the parent churches in the country of their origin, the
      Roman Catholic Church remains as firmly as ever under the control of the
      pope in Rome. Furthermore, there are no democratic processes of any kind
      in the Roman Church by which the people can indicate their preferences or
      desires to the Vatican, nor even so much as express to the bishop of their
      diocese a choice regarding their own local priests. Everything is
      autocratically controlled by the hierarchy. However, it is true that while
      the local congregation has no official part in the matter of choosing a
      priest, as a matter of practical church management the wishes and advice
      of members of the congregation often are sought and taken into
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of this organization, with almost unlimited power, is the
      pope. The next ranking officials, the cardinals, often called the “princes
      of the church,” are appointed by the pope. There is no veto power, either
      in the district or country over which the cardinal is to preside, or
      anywhere else in the church, by which his appointment can be rejected or
      even questioned. If the cardinal was a bishop or archbishop before his
      appointment, he continues to hold that office and to exercise that
      authority after his appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of cardinals has varied somewhat, the full number having
      remained at 70 for 2 the past several centuries, until Pope John XXIII, in
      1960, increased the number to 85.<sup>2</sup> The pope alone decides how
      many cardinals there shall be. Throughout most of history, a majority,
      often a large majority, have been Italians. At the present time the
      Italians number 33 (several of those are from the city of Rome), still far
      more than any other country, the next highest being 8 from France, then 6
      from the United States, 5 from Spain, 4 from Germany, 3 from Brazil, 2
      each from Britain, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina, and 1 each from 18
      other countries—surely not a very representative arrangement either
      numerically or geographically. While only 6 of these are Americans, an
      increase in 1959 from 4, the American branch of the Roman Church is by all
      odds the strongest and most influential and, from all indications,
      furnishes considerably more than half of the world revenues of the
      Vatican.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>2</sup> The number was increased to 134 by Pope Paul VI, in 1969, ten
      of whom are Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the death of a pope, the cardinals meet in Rome in the so-called
      College of Cardinals, and elect a new pope. This is their most important
      function. Usually one is chosen from their own number. After the election
      of a new pope, the cardinals individually pledge their complete allegiance
      to him, even to the extent of prostrating themselves on the floor before
      him and kissing his foot as a symbol of submission. What a servile act
      that is! They then disband and return to their respective countries. They
      have no authority to re-assemble, or to remove a pope from office no
      matter what he may do. In the meantime they remain subject to him, and can
      be removed from office by him at any time, without any explanation
      whatever if he so desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishops are usually nominated by the archbishops but receive their
      appointments directly from the pope and remain immediately subject to him.
      Each bishop is required to appear before the pope in Rome for ordination
      and to make his vows of allegiance personally to him. They too pledge
      complete allegiance in an impressive and colorful ceremony, also
      prostrating themselves before him and kissing his foot. They are the
      pope’s chief liaison officers through which he maintains contact with the
      church throughout the world. Each reports regularly to the pope concerning
      the affairs of the church in his diocese, that is, the district over which
      he has charge, and each must present himself in person to the pope at
      least once every five to ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next step down the ladder are the priests. They are immediately subject to
      the bishop of the diocese. The bishop supervises their course of training,
      inquires into the fitness of candidates, chooses those who shall be
      ordained, ordains them, assigns them to churches, transfers them, and
      removes them from office as he sees fit, without explanation if he wishes.
      Each priest pledges complete allegiance to his bishop, and submits reports
      to him. No priest who has had difficulties with his bishop will be
      accepted for work in any other diocese until he has made satisfaction to
      his own bishop. He must at all costs remain on good terms with his bishop,
      otherwise he is helpless.<sup>3</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>3</sup> Since Vatican Two, some priests’ organizations have been
      formed in the United States and in a few other countries, but for the most
      part their actions are merely advisory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in turn are expected to obey the priest, and to support him and
      the church through their services and money. They are trained and
      disciplined to that end from childhood. No one is to question the
      authority of the priest, even in domestic or family affairs. Democratic
      processes are discouraged. Lay organizations have only very limited scope,
      usually are not encouraged, and are excluded from authority in the church
      at large. Such lay organizations as do exist have clerical sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in Protestant churches the people usually have the final say in
      regard to the choice of ministers and the powers granted to them, in the
      Roman Church the laity has no part at all in the ordination and calling of
      the clergy. The Council of Trent, in a decree directed in part against
      Protestantism, placed that power safely in the hands of the clergy, with
      the pronouncement: “In the ordination of bishops, priests, and of the
      other orders neither the consent nor vocation nor authority of the
      people... is required” (Sess. XXIII, Ch. 4), and even pronounced a curse
      upon anyone claiming such rights for the laity (Canon 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church is, therefore, a totalitarian, autocratic
      organization from top to bottom. And the pope, claiming jurisdiction over
      from 300 million to 450 million Roman Catholics, the owner of fabulous
      wealth, and holding life tenure in his office, is by all odds the most
      absolute ruler in the world. And through the years, the people, even in
      freedom-loving America, have shown amazing docility in accepting the rule
      of the hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every Roman Catholic diocese, unless there are special corporation laws
      in the state favorable to the hierarchy, the title to all church
      property—grounds, churches, schools, monasteries, convents, cemeteries,
      and commercial businesses and properties owned by the church—is held by
      the bishop as an individual, often as a “corporation sole,” which is a
      legal device by which he is permitted to hold church property. He can
      mortgage, lease, or sell such properties at will without consulting the
      people or the local church or diocese, nor does he render any financial
      report to the people concerning such sales or transactions. He reports
      only to the pope in Rome. Local church finances are in the hands of the
      priest, or of the bishop to whom he reports. Control of church finances
      and property by lay trustees such as is the custom in practically all
      Protestant churches is forbidden, having been abolished by papal decree in
      the last century. The bishop in turn, under Canon Law, that is, Roman
      Catholic Church law, holds the property in trust for and subject to the
      control of the pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Roman Church in having all such property recorded in
      the name of the bishop rather than treating it as a corporation is to
      avoid the necessity of making public financial reports. Canon law does not
      permit the incorporating of such properties unless the laws of the state
      are so drawn that they grant special favors to the hierarchy— which in
      this Protestant country they usually do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the money comes from, and where it goes, is all a deep, dark
      secret—enabling the hierarchy to accept money from various sources and for
      various causes which if known might subject it to public criticism, also
      enabling it to channel money into various projects at home and abroad to
      suit the purpose of the hierarchy without the criticism that would be sure
      to arise if it were generally known how the money was used. The implicit
      trust demanded by the Roman Church extends not only to theological and
      ecclesiastical matters, but to financial matters as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast with the secrecy practiced in the Roman Church, most
      Protestant churches voluntarily make public reports at least once each
      year of all funds received and expended, both locally and in the
      denomination at large. These reports are included in the annual minutes,
      and sometimes are published in newspapers and magazines. If anyone doubts
      that the finances of the Roman Church are a closely guarded secret, let
      him try to find out how much money is received, where it comes from, how
      it is expended in the local church, how much is given to the bishop, and
      how much is sent to Rome. He will find that the priest reports only to the
      bishop and that the bishop reports only to the pope. Ironical as it may
      seem, this nation, mostly Protestant, is the main support of the Roman
      Catholic Church in her world work. But it does at least point up the fact
      that Roman Catholicism does better spiritually and economically where it
      has to stand on its own feet, where it is not supported by the state but
      is in competition with other churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the ownership of church property, a present day case that has
      attracted considerable attention is that of the De La Salle Institute, of
      Napa, California. There a group of Roman Catholic monks producing wine and
      brandy operate the largest brandy distillery in the United States, under
      the trade name Christian Brothers. Until recently they had not paid income
      taxes for thirty years. They have an outlet through the Seagrams company,
      one of the largest whiskey distributors in the industry. The Bureau of
      Internal Revenue has ruled that this company is subject to income tax, the
      amount involved being more than $1,840,000. The Christian Brothers have
      claimed exemption from corporate taxes on the profits of this commercial
      liquor business on the ground that the distillery is church property, “an
      integral part of the Roman Catholic Church,” held in trust for the benefit
      of the pope in Rome. When this case was given some publicity Christian
      Brothers paid part of the tax, $490,000, for the years 1952, 1953, and
      1956, then filed a claim to recover the money. But after a prolonged court
      trial the claim was rejected. Net corporate profits in the three years
      involved were $3,250,000. See Church and State, July-August, 1961.

    <p>
      Various other church businesses over the country come under this same
      classification, two prominent ones being a radio and television
      broadcasting station in New Orleans, which accepts commercial advertising,
      operated by Jesuit priests at Loyola University, and another in St. Louis,
      also operated by Jesuit priests. Exemption from taxation, of course, gives
      such companies a substantial advantage over other companies that pay
      taxes. Such exemption is discriminatory and unfair and is an offense
      against all people and corporations that do pay taxes.

    <h2>The Unity and Diversity in Protestantism</h2>
    <p>
      It has long been Roman Catholic policy to represent Protestantism as
      composed of many denominations which are hopelessly divided and constantly
      quarreling among themselves. In view of the Romanist emphasis on unity and
      solidarity, the Roman Catholic laity has indeed found it hard to
      understand how there can be various Protestant denominations, and this has
      presented a real stumbling-block to many who are inclined to leave the
      Church of Rome. They have been taught to believe that each Protestant
      denomination claims to be exclusively the true church (as does their own)
      and that one cannot be saved unless he belongs to that church. The puzzle
      looks insolvable. They simply would not know where to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, of course, that the right of private judgment or private
      interpretation, which is claimed by all Protestant churches, has resulted
      in the rise of a great many denominations. But the remarkable thing is
      that in Protestantism there is a strong undercurrent of spiritual unity.
      Mechanical and organizational unity is a secondary thing with them. The
      great proportion of Protestant denominations do not claim to be the only
      true church, but readily and gladly acknowledge that salvation is to be
      found in any church where the Gospel is faithfully preached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various Protestant denominations agree quite fully on practically all
      of the essentials of the faith. They believe that the Bible and the Bible
      alone is the Word of God, and they accept it as the authoritative guide in
      church affairs. They believe in the deity of Christ, in His sacrificial
      death on the cross as a substitute for those who place their faith in Him,
      and that He alone is the Head of the Church. They are in general agreement
      concerning the meaning of the sacraments, baptism, and the Lord’s Supper.
      They believe in the personal and visible return of Christ, the
      resurrection of the body, a future judgment, heaven and hell. Their ideas
      concerning moral character, spiritual life, and the relationship that
      should exist between church and state are quite similar. Whether called
      Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, or what not, they all
      belong to one body, the church of Christ, just as the 50 states of the
      United States have various names and local governments but all belong to
      one nation. Their basic attitude toward one another is not that of
      opposition and competition but rather of cooperation and friendship.
      Ministers of one denomination are often invited to speak or to conduct the
      entire service in churches of other denominations, and the laity is free
      to attend churches of which they are not members. Union services,
      particularly in evangelistic meetings, are common, often with all of the
      Protestant churches in a city cooperating, as witness the famous Billy
      Sunday evangelistic campaigns of a few years ago and the Billy Graham
      meetings in more recent years. On various radio programs the listeners are
      scarcely aware of the denomination to which the speaker belongs.
      Protestants thus acknowledge fellow Protestants in other denominations as
      true Christians. And they are united in rejecting what they believe to be
      the errors of the Roman Church, such as the priesthood, mass, confession,
      purgatory, worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the teachings that divide Protestants, while sometimes
      important in themselves, are minor compared with their differences with
      Romanism. They may differ in regard to the form of baptism or the Lord’s
      Supper; some are Calvinists while others are Arminians; their form of
      church government may be Episcopal, Presbyterian, or Congregational. But
      when the Bible is taken as the authoritative guide, the liberty that each
      has to think through his own religion and arrive at conclusions for
      himself does not make for such sharp divisions as some might expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one has expressed more beautifully the unity of the Protestant churches
      than that venerable Presbyterian theologian, Dr. Charles Hodge. Said he:
      “These separate churches remain one: (1) because they continue to be
      subject to the same Lord, to be animated by the same Spirit, and to
      possess the same faith; (2) because they recognize each other as churches,
      just as every Christian recognizes every other Christian as a fellow
      believer, and consequently recognize each other’s members, ordinances, and
      acts of discipline; (3) they continue one body because they are subject to
      one common tribunal. The tribunal at first was the apostles, now the Bible
      and the mind of the church as a whole, expressed sometimes in one way and
      sometimes in another” (article, reprinted in Eternity magazine, June,
      1958).
    </p>
    <p>
      The unity of spirit among Protestants minimizes very substantially the
      denominational differences. Consequently, when Roman Catholics leave their
      church and become Protestants, they usually are surprised at the unity of
      faith and worship which they discover. The fact is that there is often
      more unity in Protestantism than in Romanism. The rivalry that for
      centuries has existed between the Dominicans arid the Franciscans, between
      both of those orders and the Jesuits, and between various orders of monks
      and nuns, especially in countries in which there were no Protestant
      churches, has often been sharp and bitter. Such rivalries, however,
      usually are suppressed by the pope so that they do not come to public
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to the testimony of a former priest, now superintendent of Memorial
      Hospital, Phoenix, Arizona, concerning the unity that he finds in
      Protestantism and the contrast between Romanism and Protestantism as
      regards the participation of the laity in church services. Emmett
      McLoughlin, in his best seller book, People’s Padre , which was published
      in 1954 and which now has passed the 250,000 mark, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me the differences among Protestants, though doctrinal, are
      superficial and non-essential. Their unity is greater than their
      divergency. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “To me, the outstanding characteristic of all Protestant forms of worship
      is their enthusiasm. Whether in a revival tent, in an ivy-covered church,
      or in an impressive cathedral, the members of the congregation show a
      spontaneity in praying, singing, and listening that does not exist is
      Roman Catholic churches. The reason is obvious: Most Protestants go to
      church because they want to; Catholics generally are there because they
      are afraid not to be. Missing mass deliberately on only one Sunday is for
      Catholics a mortal sin and damns their souls to hell. The mass is a
      stereotyped Latin ritual that somehow is supposed to placate God.
      Protestant services of any denomination, even the silent Quaker service,
      call for an active and voluntary participation of all those present. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Protestant clergy—and I know many of them intimately—seem far more
      sincere and personally dedicated than the average Roman Catholic priest.
      This is probably because they are in the ministry through adult choice,
      not drawn into it when too young to know better. Protestants remain in the
      ministry because they wish to, not because they are bound irrevocably by
      laws of their churches or because of threats of divine and human reprisals
      if they leave the ministry” (pp. 272-273).
    </p>
    <p>
      And Walter M. Montano, a former editor of Christian Heritage , and also a
      former Roman Catholic, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “One of the outstanding marks of Protestantism is its unity in diversity.
      This is a characteristic inherent in its very nature, but unfortunately,
      is poorly understood by many of its beneficiaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This diversity creates and stimulates freedom of action within the limits
      of what is right before God and man. The dissenting groups or
      congregations, when released from their Roman shackles, leam for the first
      time the blessings of freedom of expression. Diversity blocks the road to
      any religious monopoly, and prevents any man from standing in the place of
      God to rule the community with that totalitarian despotism that in the
      lexicon of the Roman Church is called ‘papal infallibility.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “In this concept of Protestantism there is no room for anyone with the
      investiture of a pope, and for this very reason, organic unity is a
      foreign element to Protestantism. The lack of organic unity is the
      strength, not the weakness, of Protestantism, and assures to us our
      freedom before God. ... Unity and liberty are in opposition; as the one
      diminishes, the other increases. The Reformation broke down unity; it gave
      liberty. ... America, in which of all countries the Reformation at the
      present moment has farthest advanced, should offer to thoughtful men much
      encouragement. Its cities are filled with churches built by voluntary
      gifts; its clergy are voluntarily sustained, and are, in all directions,
      engaged in enterprises of piety, education, mercy. What a difference
      between their private lives and that of ecclesiastics before the
      Reformation!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately, Protestants themselves at times succumb to a superficial
      criticism of our lack of organic unity without realizing that it is the
      safeguard of our liberty in Christ. We deplore the fact that in some
      isolated quarters there exist ideas and ambitions to establish a
      ‘superchurch’ with a Protestant hierarchy and its well constituted
      ecclesiastical army. This will never happen as long as Christian
      Protestants remain loyal to the principles upon which Protestantism was
      founded. There is an essential and vast difference between organic unity,
      the boast of the Roman Church, and the spiritual unity, which identifies
      Protestant Christianity. Organic unity produces a machine which is an end
      in itself. Spiritual unity, on the other hand, the unity of the one true
      church of Jesus Christ, binds the hearts of all under one Head, the Lord
      Jesus Christ, while at the same time preserving the identity of each
      member” (Christian Heritage, October, 1958).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately among Protestants there are some who are so absorbed with
      the idea of church union that they even hope for an eventual union with
      the Roman Catholic Church. Concerning these Dr. Montano says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are foolish men who choose to walk in darkness. They cannot see the
      right path because they have chosen to be blind to the evils of the Roman
      Church, both past and present. Both of these concepts, the desire for a
      Protestant ‘super-church’ and the desire for union with the Vatican, are
      the very antithesis of Protestantism and will destroy the very thing that
      gave life to the Reformation. ... Only a militant Protestantism can save
      America and the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that there are many branches of the Christian church.
      The process of division started even in apostolic times, for we are told
      that Paul and Barnabas, though loyal friends and faithful coworkers in the
      church, disagreed because Barnabas insisted on taking Mark with them. In
      Acts 15:39 we read: “And there arose a sharp contention, so that they
      parted asunder one from the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first Epistle to the Corinthians Paul complained about divisions in
      the church because some said, “I am of Paul... I am of Apollos... I am of
      Peter... Is Christ divided?” (1:12-13). That process has been going on
      through the centuries. The church has never been one solid organization.
      From the first centuries there have been schisms, and what are called
      heresies. Furthermore, those often arose not outside of but within the
      Christian church and were defended by members within the church. The
      church still has a long way to go before spiritual unity becomes a
      reality. In the present state of the church it is inevitable that there
      should be divisions. In answer to the Roman Catholic claim to be the one
      true church, we reply. Nonsense! The Roman Church is only one branch of a
      much larger body. The Eastern Orthodox Church is older and has a more
      direct connection with apostolic Christianity than does the Roman. Each
      Protestant denomination is as much a unit within itself as is the Roman
      Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Church. And most Protestant churches have a
      record of much truer devotion and loyalty to the Scriptures, and of having
      produced a higher morality and spirituality among their people than does
      either the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but one way to prevent divisions in the present day church, and
      that is by making unity a higher virtue than truth. The Roman Church
      achieves unity by eliminating religious liberty. A member of that church
      who will not subordinate his judgment to that of the pope is
      excommunicated. But that kind of unity has no attraction for men of strong
      religious convictions. When that alternative was presented to Martin
      Luther he promptly showed his contempt for a church that would make such a
      demand by burning the papal bull and denouncing the pope who had issued it
      as Antichrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be acknowledged that many of the divisions that have occurred in
      the Christian church have been unnecessary and that some have been
      detrimental. Some have arisen because of evil motives on the part of
      certain groups, or because of the personal ambitions of strong-willed
      leaders. But many others have arisen because of natural circumstances,
      such as those of race, language, nationality, geography, or honest
      difference of opinion. If we have true spiritual unity, the lack of
      outward unity will not seriously hamper Christian life and practice. The
      spiritual unity that characterizes evangelical Protestants is more
      important than the organizational diversity that places them in different
      denominations. Religious liberty by its very nature is sure to bring some
      degree of disunity, precisely as political liberty does, for we do not all
      think alike or act alike. But to suppress that liberty is to destroy the
      very basis for evangelical theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also true that this freedom on the part of Protestants has often
      placed them at a disadvantage as they are confronted by an aggressive
      Roman Catholic Church under unified leadership. But that is precisely the
      same problem that we face in the political realm. It often happens that in
      local, state, or federal government a well organized minority pressure
      group pushes through its program and imposes its will on an unorganized
      majority. We have seen that particularly in the big city political
      machines where time and again and sometimes for long periods of time
      corrupt and unscrupulous minority groups have been in control. But nowhere
      is such action more reprehensible than in the church as minority pressure
      groups intimidate elected assemblies, the press, radio, television, the
      movies, and other media that can be used to their advantage. The remedy
      for such abuse, however, is not to abolish liberty, but, in the state, to
      inform and arouse the electorate so that it will choose clean, honest
      officials; and in the church, to so evangelize the membership and develop
      a wholesome Christian conscience that such abuses will be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary point of cleavage between the Roman Catholic and the other
      churches seems to be the fact that the Roman Church is hierarchical and
      authoritarian in its form of government, while the others are essentially
      democratic and place the control of church affairs in the hands of the
      people. It was the Vatican Council of 1870, with its pronouncement of
      papal infallibility, that sounded the death-knoll of any democratic
      processes in the Roman Church and placed it irrevocably on the road to
      totalitarianism.
