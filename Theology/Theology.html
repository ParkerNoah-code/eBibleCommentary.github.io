    <h1>Theology</h1>
    <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
    <p>
      The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
      displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation, and
      other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
      vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of topics
      like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
    </p>
    <p>
      Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the
      creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it reveals the
      underlying ground which all other sciences require for their complete
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
      aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the truth,
      and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the head, the
      heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what we do). It's
      goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the spiritual needs of
      his people and the world, and to promote godliness.
    </p>
    <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each person who
      belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
      (2 Tim 3:16-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
      press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from
      dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on
      of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. This will
      we do, if God permits." (Heb 6:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
      revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the
      words of this law." (Deut 29:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
      concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a good
      conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be
      disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ." (1 Pet 3:15-16).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that
      they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who
      hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who
      doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. But shun
      empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, and those words will
      consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: men who have
      erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past,
      and overthrowing the faith of some. However, God’s firm foundation stands,
      having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and, 'Let every one
      who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.'" (2 Tim
      2:14-19).

      1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology is
      based on the work of John Frame in
      <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to discourage
      the notion that theology is 'properly' something theoretical, something
      academic, as opposed to the practical teaching that goes on in preaching,
      counselling, and Christian friendship,”
      <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
      1987), pp. 81-85.

  <h2>Muhammad's Pedophilia</h2>
  <p>
    There are numerous sources recording Muhammad's relationship with Aisha
    including accounts from Aisha herself and from many of Islam's most trusted
    sources. The evidence that Muhammad married Aisha at six or seven years old
    and consummated the marriage while she was nine years old while he was in
    his 50's is undeniable:
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 3896—Narrated Hisham’s father: Khadija died three years
      before the Prophet departed to Al-Madina. He stayed there for two years or
      so and then he wrote the marriage (wedding) contract with Aishah when she
      was a girl of six years of age, and he consummated that marriage when she
      was nine years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 5158—Narrated Urwa: The Prophet wrote the (marriage
      contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his
      marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him
      for nine years (i.e. till his death).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahih Muslim 3310—Aisha reported: Allah’s Apostle married me when I was
      six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahih Muslim 3311—Aisha reported that Allah’s Apostle married her when she
      was seven years old, and she was taken to his house as a bride when she
      was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died
      she was eighteen years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunan Abu Dawud 2116—Aishah said: The Apostle of Allah married me when I
      was seven years old. (The narrator Sulaiman said: Or six years.) He had
      intercourse with me when I was nine years old.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    Muhammad claimed that he received dreams from Allah to marry Aisha while she
    was still 6 years old:
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 3895—Narrated Aishah that the Prophet said to her, “You
      have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of
      silk and someone said (to me), ‘This is your wife.’ When I uncovered the
      picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, ‘If this is from Allah it will
      be accomplished.’”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    After having these dreams, Muhammad asked Abu Bakr, the father of Aisha, to
    marry off his daughter to him:
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 5081—Narrated Urwa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for
      Aishah’s hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said, “But I am your brother.” The
      Prophet said, “You are my brother in Allah’s religion and His Book, but
      she (Aishah) is lawful for me to marry.”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    However, Aisha became sick at that time, so the marriage wasn't consummated
    until three years later when Aisha was 9 years old:
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 3894—Narrated Aishah: My marriage (wedding) contract with
      the Prophet was written when I was a girl of six (years). We came to
      Al-Madina and we dismounted at the place of Bani Al-Harith bin Khazraj.
      Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on, my hair grew (again) and
      my mother, Umm Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some
      of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she
      wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the
      door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became
      normal, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she
      took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who
      said, “Best wishes and Allah’s Blessing and good luck.” Then she entrusted
      me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah’s
      Messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him,
      and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    Aisha was Muhammad's favorite of many wives causing much tension between the
    women:
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 2581—Narrated Urwa that Aishah said: “The wives of
      Allah’s Messenger were in two groups.” Urwa added: One group consisted of
      Aishah, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Umm
      Salama and the other wives of Allah’s Messenger. The Muslims knew that
      Allah’s Messenger loved Aishah, so if any of them had a gift and wished to
      give to Allah’s Messenger, he would delay it till Allah’s Messenger had
      come to Aishah’s home and then he would send his gift to Allah’s Messenger
      in her home. The group of Umm Salama discussed the matter together and
      decided that Umm Salama should request Allah’s Messenger to tell the
      people to send their gifts to him in whatever wife’s house he was. Umm
      Salama told Allah’s Messenger of what they had said, but he did not reply.
      Then they (those wives) asked Umm Salama about it. She said, “He did not
      say anything to me.” They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to
      him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they
      asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, “Talk
      to him till he gives you a reply.” When it was her turn, she talked to him
      again. He then said to her, “Do not hurt me regarding Aishah, as the
      Divine Revelations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of
      Aishah.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahih al-Bukhari 6130—Narrated Aishah: I used to play with the dolls in
      the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with
      me. When Allah’s Messenger used to enter (my dwelling place), they used to
      hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.
      (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was
      allowed for Aishah at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached
      the age of puberty.)
