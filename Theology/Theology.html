    <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
    <p>
      The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
      displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation, and
      other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
      vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of topics
      like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
    </p>
    <p>
      Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the
      creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it reveals the
      underlying ground which all other sciences require for their complete
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
      aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the truth,
      and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the head, the
      heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what we do). It's
      goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the spiritual needs of
      his people and the world, and to promote godliness.
    </p>
    <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each person who
      belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
      (2 Tim 3:16-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
      press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from
      dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on
      of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. This will
      we do, if God permits." (Heb 6:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
      revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the
      words of this law." (Deut 29:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
      concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a good
      conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be
      disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ." (1 Pet 3:15-16).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that
      they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who
      hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who
      doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. But shun
      empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, and those words will
      consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: men who have
      erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past,
      and overthrowing the faith of some. However, God’s firm foundation stands,
      having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and, 'Let every one
      who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.'" (2 Tim
      2:14-19).

      1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology is
      based on the work of John Frame in
      <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to discourage
      the notion that theology is 'properly' something theoretical, something
      academic, as opposed to the practical teaching that goes on in preaching,
      counselling, and Christian friendship,”
      <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
      1987), pp. 81-85.
