    <h1>Theology</h1>
    <h2>What is Theology?</h2>
    <p>
      The word "theology" is commonly used to describe a more theoretical
      displine looking at the existence and sovereignty of God, creation, and
      other similar topics. Christian theology considers matters from the
      vantage point of Scripture and is concerned with a broader range of topics
      like ethics, Bible translation, and redemption:
    </p>
    <p>
      Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and the
      creation. Theology is the science of the sciences because it reveals the
      underlying ground which all other sciences require for their complete
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian theology is the application of Scripture by believers to all
      aspects of life.<sup>1</sup> Theology has to do with the good, the truth,
      and the beautiful. It involves the whole of the believer: the head, the
      heart, and the hands (what we think, how we feel, and what we do). It's
      goal is to allow us to know and serve God, to meet the spiritual needs of
      his people and the world, and to promote godliness.
    </p>
    <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
      for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that each person who
      belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
      (2 Tim 3:16-17).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s
      press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from
      dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on
      of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. This will
      we do, if God permits." (Heb 6:1-3).
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are
      revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the
      words of this law." (Deut 29:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason
      concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, having a good
      conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be
      disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ." (1 Pet 3:15-16).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that
      they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who
      hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who
      doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. But shun
      empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, and those words will
      consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: men who have
      erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past,
      and overthrowing the faith of some. However, God’s firm foundation stands,
      having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his,' and, 'Let every one
      who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.'" (2 Tim
      2:14-19).

      1. This definition of theology and the perspectival notion of theology is
      based on the work of John Frame in
      <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</em>
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R, 2013), Ch. 1. John Frame is “seeking to discourage
      the notion that theology is 'properly' something theoretical, something
      academic, as opposed to the practical teaching that goes on in preaching,
      counselling, and Christian friendship,”
      <em>The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God</em> (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R,
      1987), pp. 81-85.

    <h1>Roman Catholicism</h1>
    <h2>Sola Ecclesia</h2>
    <p>
      The Roman church claims far-reaching authority for itself as the only
      proper identifier and interpreter of Scripture and Tradition, which is
      considered to be the written and unwritten Word of God respectively. It
      teaches that those who presume to be able to interpret Scripture or the
      Fathers for themselves are mistaken; it belongs to the church alone to
      judge the true sense and interpretation of such writings. In terms of
      ultimate authority, this represents Sola Ecclesia, the belief that the
      Roman church alone is the supreme authority for all Christian faith and
      practice in contrast to the Protestant belief in Sola Scriptura, that the
      Scriptures alone are the sole sufficient and infallible grounds for all
      Christian faith and practice.

        Furthermore, to check unbridled spirits, it decrees that no one relying
        on his own judgment shall, in matters of faith and morals pertaining to
        the edification of Christian doctrine, distorting the Holy Scriptures in
        accordance with his own conceptions, presume to interpret them contrary
        to that sense which holy mother Church, to whom it belongs to judge of
        their true sense and interpretation, has held and holds, or even
        contrary to the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, even though such
        interpretations should never at any time be published. Those who act
        contrary to this shall be made known by the ordinaries and punished in
        accordance with the penalties prescribed by the law.

        But the task of authentically interpreting the word of God, whether
        written or handed on, has been entrusted exclusively to the living
        teaching office of the Church, whose authority is exercised in the name
        of Jesus Christ. This teaching office is not above the word of God, but
        serves it, teaching only what has been handed on, listening to it
        devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and explaining it faithfully in
        accord with a divine commission and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it
        draws from this one deposit of faith everything which it presents for
        belief as divinely revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear, therefore, that sacred tradition, Sacred Scripture and the
        teaching authority of the Church, in accord with God's most wise design,
        are so linked and joined together that one cannot stand without the
        others, and that all together and each in its own way under the action
        of the one Holy Spirit contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.
      </p>

    <p>
      The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) points to Scripture and Tradition to
      defend its complete and comprehensive authority over the Church. However,
      when one looks in Scripture, no teaching about an infallible teaching
      office can be found. Therefore, the RCC forbids its people from
      interpreting the Bible in any way contrary to its official declarations.
      The faithful Catholic looks at the text of Scripture and only finds
      support for the RCC's authority claims because they can only follow what
      the RCC says it says. A similar analysis holds for Tradition. The RCC
      defines what counts and does not count as Tradition and arrogates only to
      itself the ability to interpret said Tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, defenses of Roman Catholic beliefs and practices always boil down
      to, "Because the church says so." Rather than being a three-legged stool
      based on church heirarchy, Tradition, and Scripture, the RCC is a leaning
      tower of Piza held up solely by weak authority claims. The fundamental
      difference between Protestants and Catholics is not based on what the text
      of Scripture actually says, but on one's ultimate authority or allegiance:
      one must either follow Scripture above all else or follow the teachings of
      the Roman church above all else.
