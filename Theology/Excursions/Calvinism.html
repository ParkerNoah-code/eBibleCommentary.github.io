  <h1>Calvinism</h1>
  <h2>The Gospel</h2>
  <p>
    The Gospel as the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ, who
    reconciled sinful men to a holy God.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are fundamentally two types of religion: the religion of faith and the
    religion of works. Calvinism is portrayed as the purest form of the religion
    of faith, while Arminianism is seen as compromised by the religion of works,
    making it unstable.
  </p>

  <h2>Sovereignty</h2>
  <p>
    God's will is supreme and unconditional, independent of creation and
    stemming solely from His eternal counsel. God determines the course of
    nature and history down to the smallest details. His decrees are eternal,
    unchanging, holy, wise, and sovereign.
  </p>

  <h2>Man's Helpless Condition</h2>
  <p>
    In his fallen state, man fears and hates God, and cannot seek Him on his
    own. Only a supernatural act of God can rescue him from this condition. God
    must take the initiative to pay the penalty, cleanse from guilt, and restore
    righteousness. This is what God does for the elect - those chosen by God for
    salvation. Christ, as God incarnate, lived a sinless life and suffered the
    penalty for sin on behalf of His people. His perfect obedience earned
    righteousness for them, and His suffering was equivalent to what they would
    have endured in hell.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the benefits of Christ's redemptive work are applied to those chosen by
    the Father, they are regenerated by the Holy Spirit - made spiritually alive
    or "born again."
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus taught that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God. The
    unregenerate cannot understand spiritual things on their own. Just as a
    physically dead person cannot give themselves life, a spiritually dead
    person cannot give themselves spiritual life. This requires a supernatural
    act of God. The Holy Spirit sovereignly takes the sinner out of Satan's
    kingdom and places them in God's kingdom through spiritual rebirth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a person is spiritually reborn into God's kingdom, they cannot become
    "unborn." Just as it took supernatural action to bring them to spiritual
    life, it would require another supernatural act to remove them from that
    state. This leads to the doctrine of eternal security or perseverance of the
    saints. This gift of eternal life is not given to all people, but only to
    those God chooses. However, this doesn't mean that anyone who wants to be
    saved is excluded. The invitation in Revelation 22:17 is open to "whoever
    will."
  </p>
  <p>
    As Jesus states in John 6:44, no one can come to Him unless drawn by the
    Father. Only those made spiritually alive by the Holy Spirit have this
    desire; these are the elect.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, there are the non-elect. God doesn't actively prevent their
    salvation but simply leaves their sinful nature unchanged. The idea of a
    cruel God refusing to save willing people is a mischaracterization. God
    saves all who want to be saved, but only those whose nature has been changed
    by God actually want salvation.
  </p>

  <h2>Atonement</h2>
  <p>
    The atonement is either highly efficient and perfectly accomplished for
    some, or widely extended but imperfectly accomplished. The concept of
    unlimited atonement would mean God punishes sins twice for the lost: in
    Christ and in themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    God's sovereignty in salvation and punishment and the ultimate purpose of
    creation is for the displaying God's glory and attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sin's existence allows for the revelation of God's most glorious attributes
    - grace, mercy, love, and holiness - as displayed in His redemption of
    sinners.
  </p>

  <h2>Foreknowledge</h2>
  <p>
    The evangelical Arminian acknowledges God's foreknowledge and ability to
    predict future events. However, this creates a logical problem: if God
    foreknows an event, it becomes as fixed and certain as if it were
    foreordained.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arminians typically explain election as based on God's foreknowledge - God
    elects those He foresees will respond to His offer of salvation. However,
    this explanation is problematic. If God foresees who will be saved, He also
    foresees who will be lost. Why does God create those He knows will be lost?
    He's not obligated to create them, and if He truly wants all to be saved, He
    could refrain from creating those He knows will be lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    The question remains: Why would God create those He knows will go to hell?
    The Arminian is left with two problematic options: Deny God's foreknowledge,
    which results in a limited, ignorant, finite God, or Accept an election
    based on foreknowledge, which becomes meaningless - God electing and
    choosing those who elect and choose God first.
  </p>

  <h2>The Big Three</h2>
  <p>
    The Arminian view often cites universalistic passages in Scripture to
    support their position. The three most commonly quoted verses are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      "...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
      repentance" (2 Peter 3:9)
    </li>
    <li>
      "Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
      truth" (1 Timothy 2:4)
    </li>
    <li>
      "...Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all..." (1 Timothy 2:5-6)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These verses teach God's benevolence, not that He delights in His creatures'
    suffering. The word "will" in Scripture can mean "desire" or "purpose,"
    similar to how a judge may not desire to punish but still sentences the
    guilty.
  </p>
  <p>
    2 Peter 3:9 is addressed to Christians ("them that have obtained like
    precious faith with us" - 2 Peter 1:1), not mankind at large. It's primarily
    about Christ's second coming, not salvation. The "us-ward" refers to the
    elect, and could be read as "not willing that any of us should perish, but
    that all of us should come to repentance."
  </p>
  <p>
    1 Timothy 2:4-6 uses "all" to mean all types of people, not every
    individual. This interpretation is based on historical context:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jews had long been the primary recipients of God's grace.</li>
    <li>
      Early Christians initially limited the Messiah's mission to themselves.
    </li>
    <li>Gentile salvation was a "mystery" (Ephesians 4:6; Colossians 1:27).</li>
    <li>
      Jewish exclusivism regarded Gentiles as "unclean" or "sinners" (John 4:9,
      Acts 10:28, 11:3).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    "All" in Scripture often means "many" or "representative," not literally
    everyone:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mark 1:5: "All" of Judaea and Jerusalem were baptized by John.</li>
    <li>Acts 4:21: "All men" glorified God after a healing.</li>
    <li>Luke 21:17: Disciples would be hated by "all men."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    John 12:32: Jesus drawing "all men" means people from all nations and races,
    not every individual.
  </p>
  <p>
    1 Corinthians 15:22: "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be
    made alive" refers to resurrection life for those in Christ, not universal
    salvation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Revelation 3:20 and 22:17: These invitations are extended to all, but fallen
    man is spiritually unable to respond without the Holy Spirit's regeneration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Revelation 5:9: The redeemed are "out of every kindred, and tongue, and
    people, and nation," indicating Christ died for all types of people, not
    necessarily every individual.
  </p>
  <p>
    John 6:37: "All" can mean all the elect or all those given to Christ by the
    Father.
  </p>

  <h2>System Thinking</h2>
  <p>
    Weak faith and superficial Christianity often result from not seeing the
    logical consistency of this system. Christians should understand not just
    that they're forgiven, but how and why their redemption was accomplished and
    made effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, the five points of Calvinism have been held by Presbyterian
    and Reformed churches and many Baptists, while Arminianism has been
    prevalent in Methodist and Lutheran churches, as well as among many
    Baptists.
  </p>

  <h2>The 5 Points of Arminianism</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Free will</b>: The concept suggests that despite the negative impact of
    humanity's fall from grace, people still retain some spiritual agency. The
    divine offers everyone the opportunity for redemption and faith, but doesn't
    force these choices upon individuals. Each person has autonomy in their
    decisions, and their ultimate fate is determined by how they exercise this
    freedom. This freedom includes the capacity to choose righteousness over
    wrongdoing in matters of the spirit. A person's will isn't completely bound
    by their inherent sinful nature. Individuals have the ability to either work
    alongside divine guidance and experience spiritual renewal, or to reject
    divine assistance and face spiritual demise. While those who are spiritually
    lost benefit from divine support, they don't necessarily need to be
    spiritually reborn before they can have faith. The act of believing is seen
    as a human action that comes before spiritual rebirth. In this view, faith
    is portrayed as humanity's offering to the divine, representing the
    individual's personal contribution to their own salvation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Conditional election</b>: This concept proposes that divine selection of
    individuals for salvation was based on foreknowledge of their future
    responses to spiritual calling. The idea suggests that only those who would
    independently choose to believe were selected. In this view, the act of
    divine election was contingent upon human actions rather than being an
    unconditional choice. The faith that formed the basis of this selection is
    seen not as a divine gift or the result of spiritual regeneration, but as a
    product of human free will alone. This perspective places the ultimate
    decision for belief, and consequently for election to salvation, entirely in
    human hands. It suggests that the divine chose individuals based on the
    foresight of who would voluntarily choose to follow spiritual teachings.
    Therefore, according to this concept, it's the individual's choice to
    believe - not divine selection - that is considered the primary cause of
    salvation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>General atonement</b>: This concept proposes that the sacrificial work of
    Christ created the potential for universal salvation, but didn't guarantee
    salvation for any specific individual. The idea suggests that while Christ's
    death was for all of humanity, salvation is only realized by those who
    actively choose to believe. In this view, Christ's sacrifice allows for the
    possibility of divine forgiveness, but this forgiveness is conditional upon
    individual belief. The atonement itself is not seen as directly removing
    anyone's transgressions. Instead, it creates the opportunity for
    forgiveness, which must then be actively embraced by each person. The
    redemption only becomes active and applicable when an individual decides to
    accept it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Uneffectual call</b>: This concept suggests that the Holy Spirit's
    influence can be effectively resisted by individuals. According to this
    view, the Spirit internally calls all those who receive the external
    invitation of the gospel. The Spirit is seen as doing everything possible to
    guide each person towards salvation. Faith, viewed here as a human
    contribution, is seen as a prerequisite for spiritual regeneration. The
    Spirit is portrayed as only being able to draw to Christ those who willingly
    allow themselves to be influenced. As a result, divine grace is not seen as
    irresistible or invincible. Instead, it's portrayed as something that can
    be—and often is—resisted and counteracted by human choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Losing salvation</b>: This concept, known as "falling from grace,"
    suggests that individuals who have genuinely believed and been saved can
    potentially lose their salvation if they fail to maintain their faith.
    However, it's important to note that not all who adhere to Arminian theology
    agree on this point. Some maintain that believers are eternally secure in
    Christ, meaning that once a person is spiritually regenerated, they can
    never lose their salvation. According to the Arminian view, salvation is
    achieved through a collaborative effort between God, who initiates the
    process, and humans, who must respond. The human response is seen as the
    determining factor in this process. At the critical juncture, human will is
    viewed as playing a decisive role. As a result, this suggests that it is
    ultimately the individual, rather than God, who determines who will receive
    the gift of salvation.
  </p>

  <h2>The 5 Points of Calvinism</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Total depravity</b>: Due to humanity's fallen nature, individuals are
    inherently incapable of choosing salvation on their own. This doctrine
    posits that humans are spiritually dead, unable to perceive or respond to
    divine truth, and possess a corrupted will bound to evil. Consequently,
    salvation requires more than mere assistance from the Holy Spirit; it
    necessitates complete spiritual regeneration. In this view, faith is not a
    human contribution to salvation but rather a divine gift, integral to God's
    salvific work in the believer's life.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Unconditional Election</b>: This posits that God's selection of
    individuals for salvation is based solely on His sovereign will, rather than
    any foreseen merit or action of the chosen. This doctrine asserts that God's
    election occurs before the world's creation and is not influenced by
    anticipated faith, repentance, or any other human response. Instead, God
    bestows faith and repentance upon those He has chosen. Thus, these spiritual
    acts are consequences of God's election, not its cause. This view emphasizes
    that salvation ultimately stems from God's choice of the individual, rather
    than the individual's choice of God, highlighting divine sovereignty in the
    salvation process.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Particular redemption</b>: Christ's sacrificial death was specifically
    intended for and effective only for the elect. This view holds that Jesus'
    atonement fully secured salvation for those chosen by God, including the
    gift of faith necessary for their redemption. It argues that Christ's death
    was a substitutionary punishment, bearing the penalty of sin for specific
    individuals rather than for all of humanity. The doctrine maintains that the
    Holy Spirit unfailingly applies the gift of faith to all those for whom
    Christ died, thereby ensuring their salvation. This concept emphasizes the
    efficacy and particularity of Christ's redemptive work for the elect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Irresistible grace</b>: God's saving grace is irresistibly applied to the
    elect. This concept distinguishes between an external call to salvation
    available to all who hear the Gospel, which can be rejected, and an internal
    call exclusive to the elect that invariably leads to salvation. The doctrine
    holds that the Holy Spirit draws the elect to Christ in a manner that cannot
    be resisted or thwarted by human will. It emphasizes that God's grace
    operates independently of human cooperation, effectively causing the elect
    to willingly embrace faith, repentance, and Christ. This view underscores
    the invincible nature of divine grace in securing the salvation of those to
    whom it is extended.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Perseverance of the saints</b>: Those chosen by God, redeemed by Christ,
    and given faith by the Holy Spirit are eternally saved and will persevere in
    faith until the end. This doctrine emphasizes that salvation is entirely the
    work of the triune God: the Father's election, the Son's redemption, and the
    Spirit's effectual calling. It maintains that God's power preserves
    believers in faith, ensuring their ultimate salvation. This view underscores
    that the entire salvation process is by God's grace alone, with God
    determining the recipients of salvation. The passage concludes with an
    evangelical appeal, urging those who haven't accepted Christ to seek God's
    mercy and put their trust in Jesus for salvation, citing biblical promises
    of God's forgiveness and assurance to those who believe.
