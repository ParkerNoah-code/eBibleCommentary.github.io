        <h2>Ephesians 1:3–10 – The Plan to Redeem His People</h2>
    
        <h3>The Design and Efficacy of God's Plan</h3>
        <p>God's plan is perfect and successful because He governs all of history. He can prophesy, act decisively, and effectively accomplish His will. This gives us assurance.</p>
    
        <h4>Key Question: The Centrality of Christ's Sacrifice</h4>
        <p>Given the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in God's redemptive plan, it is appropriate to ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For whom did Christ die?</li>
            <li>What was the intention of the cross?</li>
            <li>What ends did it accomplish?</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Possible Objections:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>"It's obvious; this is not a serious question."</li>
            <li>"You're just nitpicking. It doesn't really matter."</li>
            <li>"You're being divisive. Can't we all just get along?"</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <p>The answer is not as obvious as it might seem because there are two prevailing schools of thought: universal redemption and particular redemption (often referred to as "limited atonement").</p>
    
        <p>The question involves understanding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The character and intent of God in redemption.</li>
            <li>The work of Christ and its specific purpose.</li>
            <li>The plan of God to save His people and provide assurance of salvation.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>This is not a trivial matter. Christ's suffering and resurrection were the culmination of Old Testament prophecy and are central to New Testament teaching. The theme of redemption runs throughout the Scriptures.</p>
    
        <h3>The Message of Salvation</h3>
        <p>The message of salvation must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Central to Christian teaching.</li>
            <li>The foundation for preaching and proclamation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even the angels long to understand the mystery of redemption (1 Peter 1:12). Scripture reveals how the Christ would suffer, be glorified, make atonement, and vindicate the Father's justice (Isaiah 53; Luke 24:26).</p>
    
        <h4>Preface: For Whom Did Christ Suffer and Atone?</h4>
        <p>The Lord of Glory purchased the church with His own blood (Acts 20:28).</p>
    
        <h4>Intention</h4>
        <p>Christ's sacrifice was sufficient to atone for everyone's sins. However, He would not need to suffer more to atone for the elect’s sins than for the sins of others, for His righteousness is infinite and perfect. The real question is not sufficiency but rather the design and purpose of the sacrifice.</p>
    
        <h4>Universal Consequences and Benefits</h4>
        <p>It is also important to acknowledge the universal relevance of Christ's atonement. Because Jesus died upon the cross and redeemed a people for Himself, temporal goods and benefits still flow down to humanity at large. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Judgment is delayed for the sake of the elect.</li>
            <li>Moral, cultural, and physical benefits extend to the unbelieving world as a result of Christ’s work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While these benefits are not salvific in nature, they are nevertheless real and significant.</p>
    
        <h4>For Whom Did Christ Sacrifice Himself?</h4>
        <p>Every individual / all mankind?<br> The elect / all believers?</p>
    
        <h4>Two Possibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Possible salvation for all (universal provision).</li>
            <li>Certain salvation for God's elect (particular redemption).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Dividing Question:</h4>
        <p>Did Christ die for the unbeliever whose destiny is damnation?</p>
    
        <h4>Motivations for Answering "Yes" to Universal Redemption:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To legitimize evangelism—validating human activity in sharing the gospel.</li>
            <li>To sincerely offer the gospel as God’s provision to all.</li>
            <li>Fairness and impartiality of God—doesn't a specific atonement seem unfair?</li>
            <li>Universal relevance—Christ’s death affects everyone in some way.</li>
            <li>To attribute eternal punishment to the will and free choice of man, rather than to God's decree.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Statement of My Position:</h4>
        <p>Christ died for His own:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>His chosen people.</li>
            <li>His church.</li>
            <li>His sheep.</li>
            <li>His friends.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>God's Plan: His Love</h3>
        <p>Salvation was God's plan from eternity past. One does not plan if they do not care or if they act foolishly. But God had a plan—a plan surpassing all human vision and understanding—because He deeply cares for His creation.</p>
    
        <h3>God's Sovereign Control Over History</h3>
    <p>Every single event that happens in history unfolds exactly according to God’s eternal and immutable plan. This plan is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grand enough to encompass all the major parts of redemptive history.</li>
        <li>Precise enough to include the smallest details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing comes to pass outside of God’s ordaining will. Every moment fits into His overarching plan, perfectly, certainly, and for ultimate good.</p>

    <h4>Biblical Support for God's Sovereign Plan</h4>
    <p><strong>Daniel 4:34–37</strong>: God’s dominion is everlasting, and He does all things according to His will in heaven and on earth. No one can thwart His purposes or question His justice, goodness, or sovereignty.</p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah 46:8–11</strong>: "God's counsel shall stand, and He will accomplish all His purposes." He declares the end from the beginning, even things that have not yet happened. His plan will come to pass.</p>

    <h4>Efficacious Nature of His Plan</h4>
    <p>God's plans are not merely intentions—they are efficacious. They will happen.</p>
    <p><strong>Isaiah 14:26–27</strong>: "The LORD has purposed, and His hand is stretched out. Who can challenge it?" God works among the nations, and no one can thwart or undo His design.</p>

    <p>God's plan is eternal and has existed from ancient times, even before the foundation of the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Psalm 33:11</strong>: "The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations."</p>
    <p>God's plan is firm, as opposed to the fleeting and unstable plans of people (<strong>Psalm 33:10</strong>).</p>

    <h4>The Immutability of God's Plan</h4>
    <p>God is immutable—His plan will not change.</p>
    <p>In Him, there is no variation or shadow due to change (<strong>James 1:17</strong>).</p>

    <p><strong>Ephesians 1:11</strong>: God works all things according to the counsel of His will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: Believers receive an eternal inheritance because of God's unchanging purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Predestination</strong>: God predestines His people according to His plan.</li>
        <li><strong>God's Sovereignty</strong>: He works all things according to His will.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>God's Sovereign Control Over All Things</h4>
    <p>All things work for His purpose, and nothing escapes His plan. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural events in history.</li>
        <li>The details of human life, including the hairs on a person's head, the sparrow, and the will of man.</li>
        <li>Even seemingly "random" events fall under God's providence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Proverbs 16:33</strong>: "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD."</p>

    <h4>Evil Events and God's Sovereign Purpose</h4>
    <p>Even the most perverse, evil, and wicked events in history are not outside of God's plan and purpose. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Joseph sold into slavery</strong>: What his brothers intended for evil, God intended for good (<strong>Genesis 50:20</strong>).</li>
        <li><strong>The Assyrian invasion</strong>: Though Assyria plundered the Northern Kingdom out of greed, God used them to bring righteous judgment (<strong>Isaiah 10:5–7</strong>).</li>
        <li><strong>The crucifixion of Christ</strong>: Wicked men carried out the death of Christ, yet God ordained it for the salvation of His people (<strong>Acts 2:23</strong>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>God's Plan</h4>
    <p>On some level, every Christian believes in God's sovereign control over history. This is why we pray for God to intervene or work in specific ways.</p>
    <p>We take comfort in the fact that all things work together for good (<strong>Romans 8:28</strong>). If things were random or outside of God's control, we could not be certain of this promise. However, we know that even sufferings are ultimately for our good.</p>

    <h3>How Does This Apply to Salvation?</h3>
    <p>For those of us who believe, we can confidently say, "God gave us eternal life."</p>
    <p><strong>John 5:11–13</strong>: "God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We can know that we have eternal life through faith.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How does this happen?</h4>
    <p>Through faith. Faith is the means by which we believe and receive the promise of eternal life.</p>

    <h4>Where Does Faith Come From?</h4>
    <p><strong>Philippians 1:29</strong>: Faith is not self-generated; "It has been granted to you for the sake of Christ."</p>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 2:8–9</strong>: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."</p>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>God gives eternal life. → Ends</li>
        <li>How? Through faith.</li>
        <li>Where does faith come from? → Means</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Faith comes from God.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>God supplies both the ends and the means of salvation.</p>

    <h4>What Lies Behind God's Plan?</h4>
    <p>Why are some men made to differ from others? Why are some saved while others are not?</p>

    <h4>Biblical Explanation of God’s Plan</h4>
    <p><strong>Ephesians 1:3–4</strong>: "God blessed us with every spiritual blessing, including faith, by union with Christ, according to His eternal plan."</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 1:9–10</strong>: "He saved us and called us, not because of our works or will, but because of His purpose and grace, which He gave us in Christ before the ages began."</p>
