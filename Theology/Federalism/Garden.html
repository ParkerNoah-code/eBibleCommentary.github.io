        <h1>The Garden of Eden</h1>
        <h2>The Garden</h2>
        <p>
          Genesis 2: "7 The LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and
          breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
          soul. 8 The LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he
          put the man whom he had formed. 9 Out of the ground the LORD God made
          every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food,
          including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of
          the knowledge of good and evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was
          parted, and became the source of four rivers. 11 The name of the first
          is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is
          gold; 12 and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone
          are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the
          same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 14 The name of
          the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of
          Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
        </p>
        <p>
          15 The LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to
          cultivate and keep it. 16 The LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You
          may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but you shall not eat
          of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you
          eat of it, you will surely die.” "
        </p>
        <h2>Garden as Temple</h2>
        <p>
          Ezekiel 28: "11 Moreover the LORD’s word came to me, saying, 12 “Son
          of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and tell him,
          ‘The Lord GOD says:
        </p>
        <p>
          “You were the seal of full measure, full of wisdom, and perfect in
          beauty. 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone
          adorned you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire,
          turquoise, and beryl. Gold work of tambourines and of pipes was in
          you. They were prepared in the day that you were created. 14 You were
          the anointed cherub who covers. Then I set you up on the holy mountain
          of God. You have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of
          fire. 15 You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were
          created, until unrighteousness was found in you.’” "
        </p>
