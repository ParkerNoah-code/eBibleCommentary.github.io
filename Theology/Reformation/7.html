        <p>
          &quot;One is your Master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot;
          Matthew 23:8
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most inveterate sins of fallen humanity, is pride. Man
          thirsts for power. He loves to be elevated above his fellows, and to
          occupy a position of acknowledged superiority. He delights to be
          clothed with a little brief authority, which will enable him to look
          on all around him as his inferiors. It is the working of this spirit
          of arrogance which has created so many grades among men, both in the
          world and in the church. Christ&#x27;s apostles were infected with
          this spirit. They had imbibed it from the Jewish Scribes and
          Pharisees. They thirsted for the possession of such a degree of power
          and authority, as would entitle them to dictate to and rule over their
          brethren. Hence, we find them frequently disputing as to who should be
          the greatest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ invariably rebuked this spirit on every occasion of its
          manifestation. He taught them humility. He showed them that the
          principles of his gospel were opposed to all such sentiments of pride,
          and that instead of favoring the arrogant wishes of depraved
          humanity--it was designed to convert believers into a universal
          brotherhood, all possessing equal rights, acknowledging but one Head,
          one Superior, one Master, even Christ himself. He taught that his
          church was to be an association of brethren, all its members subject
          to one law, and all amenable to one tribunal, the voice of Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          But how sadly has the teaching of Christ on this subject been
          perverted; and the professedly Christian church, instead of presenting
          to us the beautiful picture of a circle of brethren, meeting together
          on the broad platform of equality, exhibits an array of gradations in
          authority, which vies with the most despotic governments of the world.
          Priestly arrogance and ministerial assumption of authority are
          exhibited on almost every hand, in both the Protestant and Papal
          churches; and from the class-leader to the mitered bishop--from the
          ruling elder to the triple-crowned Pope--there is a violation of
          Christ&#x27;s declaration: &quot;One is your master, even Christ, and
          all you are brethren.&quot; Reform here is needed; and I announce,
          therefore, as the Fourth Feature of the reform at which Baptists aim,
        </p>
        <p>The establishment of the equality of Christ&#x27;s disciples.</p>
        <p>
          I. It will devolve on me to show, in the first place, that such
          equality does not generally exist. In Romish and Protestant churches
          there is no recognition of equality among professed disciples of
          Christ. I suppose I need not stop to prove this assertion in reference
          to Romanism. All acknowledge that there are grades of power, both
          temporal and ecclesiastical, in that church. Even her most devoted
          adherents will not deny it. On the contrary, they admit and defend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us, then, turn to the Protestant churches. And first we will
          notice the EPISCOPAL Church. Does this church recognize equality among
          her members? We reply, No! She has distinct and separate grades; and
          not only is the ministry above the laity, but there are three grades
          in the ministry: deacons, priests and bishops.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the ANGLICAN church in England, the bishops of this church, by
          virtue of their office, are clothed with temporal power. They are
          peers of the realm—that is, nobles of the land. The archbishop of
          Canterbury has the appointment of all the bishops, and is the highest
          nobleman of England. The archbishops hold authority over all the
          bishops. The bishops hold authority over all the churches, and
          inferior clergy, in their respective dioceses. They appoint ministers
          to their charges; they suspend, degrade, and excommunicate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In America there are no archbishops. But the bishops, though
          possessing no civil power, have the same ecclesiastical power as those
          in England. The church has no voice in her government. In the
          Triennial Convention, the bishops form a separate house distinct and
          superior to the clergy and laity. The appropriate language of the
          bishops in England would be: &quot;One is our Master, the archbishop,
          and all we are lords;&quot; while both in England and America there is
          no recognition of the equality taught by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us look again at the PRESBYTERIAN church. Does equality reign
          here? Do all her members stand on the broad even platform of the
          Gospel? Can they say, &quot;One is our Master, even Christ?&quot; Let
          them answer for themselves. Both in their Confession of Faith and Form
          of Government, we find that the government rests not in the hands of
          the church, but in the session, presbytery, synod and General
          Assembly. These bodies attend to all the business of the church. An
          individual church has no power to act in the reception of members, the
          exclusion of members, the calling or dismissing of a pastor, or any
          other act of government which Christ has committed to his church.
          Other masters are recognized besides him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole tendency of Presbyterian church government is to exalt the
          ministry in their authority above the church. Indeed, the ministry
          belong to a different order. They do not belong to the church as the
          other members do; they belong to the Presbytery. The church can not
          discipline a minister; neither can the session try him; but the
          presbytery must do it. Lest these assertions should startle any who
          have never examined the subject, permit me to give a few quotations
          from printed documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Confession says: &quot;The Lord Jesus, as king and
          head of his church, has therein appointed a government in the hand of
          church-officers. To these officers, the keys of the kingdom of Heaven
          are committed, by virtue whereof they have power, respectively, to
          retain and remit sins, to shut that kingdom against the impenitent,
          both by the word and censures, and to open it onto penitent sinners as
          occasion shall require.&quot; These officers we are told, by the Form
          of Government, are &quot;Bishops or pastors, ruling elders and
          deacons.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same Form of Government gives us the character of all the
          different bodies composed by these officers, for the government of the
          church. &quot;The church session consists of the pastor or pastors,
          and ruling elders of a particular congregation;&quot; and &quot;it is
          expedient, at every meeting of the session, that there be a presiding
          minister. When, therefore, a church is without a pastor, the moderator
          of the session shall be either the minister appointed by the
          presbytery for that purpose, or one invited by the session.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we are told that among other things &quot;it is the duty of the
          session to receive members into the church, or exclude from the church
          those who deserve it, and to appoint delegates to the higher
          judicatories of the church.&quot; The church cannot act in receiving
          her own members. The session attends to this for her. A majority of
          the members of the church might be opposed to the reception of an
          individual, but if the session receives him, he is admitted. On the
          other hand, a person may fall under the censure of the session, and,
          though all the church beside may esteem him a Christian—the session
          has power to exclude and excommunicate him. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is more fully exhibited in the Directory for Worship. We are told
          that when baptized children &quot;come to years of discretion, if they
          are free from scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient
          knowledge to discern the Lord&#x27;s body, they ought to be informed
          it is their duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The
          years of discretion in young Christians cannot be precisely fixed.
          This must be left to the prudence of the eldership. The officers of
          the church are the judges of the qualifications of those to be
          admitted to sealing ordinances; and of the time when it is proper to
          admit young Christians to them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here implied that the church, that is, the inferior members of
          it, as distinct from the session, is not possessed of sufficient
          prudence to judge of the qualifications of those who are to be
          admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, the Presbytery has power over the session and the church.
          By this body the rights of the church to call and dismiss a pastor are
          taken away from the people. When a Presbyterian church calls a pastor,
          the call is not made to him, but to the Presbytery. &quot;The call
          shall be presented to the Presbytery under whose care the person
          called shall be; that, if the Presbytery think it expedient to present
          the call to him, it may be accordingly presented; and no minister or
          candidate shall receive a call, but through the hands of a
          Presbytery.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, also, the minister himself is subject, not to the church, but to
          the Presbytery. He can not move without the permission of this body.
          &quot;No pastor shall be translated from one church to another, nor
          shall he receive any call for that purpose, but by the permission of
          the Presbytery.&quot; &quot;The Presbytery, on the whole view of the
          case, shall either continue him in his former charge, or translate
          him, as they shall deem most for the peace and edification of the
          church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here implied that the Presbytery is more competent to judge of
          the affairs of a church, and to decide what is for its good, than the
          church itself! The church may think it best for their pastor to remove
          from them; but the Presbytery may think it best for him to stay; the
          only alternative the church has, is to starve him out, and this they
          cannot do, so long as they have real estate enough to pay his salary.
          This system is degrading to freemen, and insulting to Christianity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to the Presbytery is the Synod, and then the General Assembly.
          The Session must submit its doings to the Presbytery, the Presbytery
          to the Synod, and the Synod to the General Assembly. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          The DUTCH REFORMED church is governed in a manner similar to the
          Presbyterian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us turn our attention for a moment to the METHODIST EPISCOPAL
          church. Shall we find equality here? No; for its very name shows that
          its government is prelatical. I need not enlarge on this point; for no
          one, surely, will pretend that there is equality in this church. Its
          founder expressly disavows any idea of it. He says, in a letter to
          John Mason, dated Jan. 13, 1790, &quot;As long as I live the people
          shall have no share in choosing either stewards or leaders among the
          Methodists. We are no republicans, and never intend to be. It would be
          better for those who are so minded to go quietly away.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more grades in the Methodist Episcopal church than in any
          other Protestant community; and any one who will read the
          &quot;Discipline,&quot; will be convinced of it. A private member in
          the church has no voice whatever in the government. Private members
          are amenable to the class-leader; the class-leader to the preacher;
          the preacher to the presiding elder; the presiding elder to the
          bishop. Is this equality? The people have no voice in electing or
          dismissing their preacher, but must take whoever is sent, and let him
          go at the expiration of three years. The preacher has no choice of his
          field of labor. He must go just where the bishop may please to send
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church does not receive or expel either her ministers or members.
          The circuit preacher has power to expel private members; the quarterly
          conference to expel local preachers, deacons and elders; the yearly
          conference to expel traveling preachers; the general conference to
          expel bishops. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the following question and answer in the Methodist Discipline, in
          reference to the ordination of an elder, and then read the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Will you reverently obey your chief ministers, unto whom is
          committed the charge and government over you; following with a glad
          mind and will their godly admonitions, and submitting yourself to
          their godly judgments?
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I will do so, the Lord being my helper.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          Chief ministers! chief ministers! who are they? &quot;One is your
          master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; Surely, the
          language of Christ, and the language of the Discipline are very
          dissimilar. These churches, whose forms of government I have reviewed,
          compose the great majority of the professedly Christian world. It is
          evident, then, that such equality as the text teaches does not
          generally exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I proceed to show, in the second place, that Baptists seek to
          establish such equality. The principles of church government in the
          Baptist denomination are expressed in the text: &quot;One is your
          master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; There is no
          opportunity for the assumption of authority by a few, if it were
          desired. All meet on the broad, even platform of equality. The rich
          and the poor, the minister, deacons, and people, are all brethren. The
          pastor is no more, the poorest member is no less, than one of the
          brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each church, in its collective capacity, transacts its own business,
          exercises its own discipline, and receives and excludes its own
          members, subject only to the authority of Christ, and governed only by
          his Word. On all questions, every member of the church has an equal
          right to speak and to vote. There is no authority superior to the
          church, to reverse its decisions, or to call it to account. The
          pastor, while he has no superior authority, has equal rights with the
          rest of his brethren. If called to another field of labor, he is at
          liberty to go without asking permsission from a bishop, presbytery, or
          council. He is perfectly free to act in accordance with his own views
          of duty and his own convictions of right.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a Baptist church there is perfect equality. It could not be
          otherwise. They recognize the church as a voluntary organization, into
          which persons enter by their own choice, and whose privileges and
          benefits all have an equal right to share. Christ has nowhere
          delegated his authority to a body of arrogant ministers, or prelatical
          bishops, or blasphemous popes; and Christians have no right to
          recognize and uphold the assumption of authority by them. It is not a
          matter of indifference. To support the assumptions of men, who have
          arrogated to themselves authority which belongs only to Christ, is to
          engage with them in rebellion against the one only Master; and where
          this is done knowingly, such cannot be held guiltless.
        </p>
        <p>
          In laboring, then, to advance Baptist sentiments, we aim to exalt
          Christ as the supreme and only Lawgiver and Ruler in Zion, in the
          place of presbyters, and bishops, and councils, and popes, who have
          usurped his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, some suppose that every church has a right to make its own laws,
          and to alter these laws to suit times, and circumstances, and places.
          Now, if the church was a merely human organization, this might be
          correct reasoning. But all churches claim to be of divine origin, and
          to have divine authority for their constitution and government. It is
          evident, therefore. that all cannot be right, for God cannot sanction
          contradictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, if every church has a right to establish its own form of
          government, then the Romish church has an equal right with any
          Protestant church to invent and establish one, and no Protestant who
          takes this ground can consistently say a word against the Papal
          hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if all are right, then right and wrong are no longer opposites.
          But all are not right. Christ has taught, in his Word, that the
          highest authority on earth is the church. Hence, in giving his
          apostles directions how to proceed in cases of offence, he designates
          the church as the supreme and final umpire. &quot;Tell it to the
          church; and if he neglects to hear the church, let him be to you as a
          heathen man and a publican.&quot; Tell it to the church—not to the
          session, or presbytery, or synod, or general assembly, or council, or
          conference, or bishop, or cardinal, or pope—but to the church. And if
          he neglects to hear the church—what then? appeal? No; there is no
          higher authority to appeal to; for &quot;One is your master, even
          Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; The creation of other
          tribunals is the result of the arrogance of men who love to &quot;lord
          it over God&#x27;s heritage;&quot; and the support of them is owing
          mainly to the influence of just such men, and their willing dupes.
          Baptists are willing to be &quot;all brethren;&quot; the ministry has
          no desire to be exalted to a position of rivalry to the Master in his
          church.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order more forcibly to exhibit the contrast between Baptists and
          the other most prominent seats, let us suppose Christ to come again
          upon earth, and visit the places of worship in New York city and
          preach from this text. See him enter St. Patrick&#x27;s cathedral. The
          Cardinal receives him very graciously, elated with the idea that the
          claim of Rome to be THE church is thus sanctioned by the Savior, and
          he invites him to preach. He announces this text, and preaches as he
          did upon the plains of Judea: &quot;You know that those who are
          accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them, and
          their great ones exercise authority over them; but so shall it not be
          among you. But whoever will be great among you shall be your servant;
          and whoever of you will be the chief, shall be the servant of all. Be
          not called rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ, and all you are
          brethren.&quot;

          The Cardinal grows uneasy; he reminds the Preacher of the Pope, the
          Cardinals, the Archbishops, the Bishops, the Father Confessors, the
          Priests; but the Divine Teacher asserts that these are distinctions
          which men have made, and reiterates the doctrine of the text—universal
          equality among his disciples. The Cardinal denounces the Savior as a
          heretic, and he is thrust out.

          He then wends his way through our great thoroughfare to Trinity
          Church. Here he is cordially received, for the Episcopal also claims
          to be THE Church, and here he repeats the sermon. But he is reminded
          of the Archbishops, the Bishops, the Triennial Convention, the
          Priests, the Deacons. He pronounces these classes all contrary to his
          teaching. The Bishop intimates that he is probably a fanatical
          dissenter, and he is politely handed to the door.

          He visits in succession a Presbyterian and a Methodist congregation
          with the same sermon. In the former he is reminded of the Session,
          Presbytery, Synod, General Assembly. In the latter, he is cautioned
          about the &quot;chief ministers;&quot; and the Class-leader, Steward,
          Preacher, Presiding Elder, Bishop, with their respective powers, are
          set before him. And for simply reiterating his own teachings, he is
          treated as a disturber of the peace, and put out of both places.

          See him now seek a Baptist pulpit. His sermon is just in accordance
          with their practice. There is nothing among them with which it comes
          in contact; no classes—none to exercise lordship or authority over
          them: &quot;for one is their Master, even Christ, and all they are
          brethren.&quot; A sincere &quot;Amen,&quot; is the response from every
          heart, and the world&#x27;s Redeemer, banished from the Romish and
          Protestant assemblies, finds a refuge and a home in every Baptist
          church!
