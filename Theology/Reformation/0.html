        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <p>
          The following Lectures were not originally intended for the press;
          but, in compliance with the wish of some of those who listened to
          them, the author has been induced to publish them. It is only with the
          hope that they may tend to advance a pure Christianity, that they are
          now given to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author regards it as one of the auspicious signs of the times,
          that greater attention is beginning to be given, by Baptist writers,
          to the great principles involved in the action of our denomination,
          rather than to a revival of the philological question, which the
          scholarship of the world has long ago decided in our favor. The more
          these principles are exhibited and developed, the more they will gain
          the approbation of all who sincerely love &quot;the truth as it is in
          Jesus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This course appears the more necessary and desirable, from the fact
          that Baptist principles have been extensively misrepresented, and much
          misunderstood. It seems important, too, from the fact that many
          persons have united with the denomination, from a conviction that our
          practice, in reference to the mode and subjects of baptism, is
          strictly Scriptural, while they have not clearly comprehended all that
          is involved in our position and peculiarities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Lectures were presented to, and are published for, Protestants.
          They tend to show that Protestantism itself needs to be reformed—that
          it is sadly defective as an instrument of attack upon the errors of
          Rome, and the evils of the Papacy. How conclusively this is done, the
          reader must decide. The presentation of these defects has not been a
          work in which the author has delighted or rejoiced, except as he has
          been led to hope that their exposure might lead to their abandonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toward those who bear a resemblance to Christ in their moral features,
          he cherishes sincere affection; and the firm belief that the great
          majority of the professed disciples of Christ in the Protestant
          churches in this country, bear such resemblance, encourages him to
          look for success in seeking to advance scriptural views of Gospel
          ordinances.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the sincere prayer that their publication may aid in bringing
          &quot;all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,&quot; to the
          only platform of Christian union—Bible truth—these Lectures are
          commended to the candid consideration of the reader, and to the
          blessing of God.
        </p>
        <h2>Preface 1876</h2>
        <p>
          The following Lectures have a peculiar history. They were originally
          delivered to the Baptist Church in Caldwell, N. J., in the ordinary
          course of pastoral labors in that place, and were not then intended
          for the press. At the urgent request of those who heard them, the
          author was induced to give them to the public. They were delivered
          from meager notes, and from these, as his &quot;copy,&quot; the
          author, himself a practical printer, set up the types of the first
          edition, which was published in 1858. As much of the matter was thus
          extemporized, at the &quot;case,&quot; the entire book was never
          written. The late excellent Spencer H. Cone then pastor of the First
          Baptist Church of New York city, read the proofs, and so well pleased
          was he with the work, that he ordered the first fifty copies for his
          own church, recommending it from his pulpit as well as by the notice
          which appears among the &quot;Recommendations.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Several editions were printed during the few following years, and the
          work was widely circulated through the country, and seems to have
          given a new phase to the baptismal controversy, by directing attention
          to the great principles which underlie the action of the Baptist
          denomination. It shows that these principles, though based on
          God&#x27;s Word, are constantly violated by Protestant Paedobaptists,
          though they profess to be governed by that Word. Not a few of these
          have been led, by the perusal of previous editions, to see the utter
          inconsistency of Paedobaptism with the principles of the New
          Testament, and have renounced it, and united with the Baptist
          denomination. Among these, several highly honored and useful brethren,
          now in the ministry of the denomination, might be named.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occurrence of our National Centennial seemed to the author an
          appropriate time to issue a revised and enlarged edition, especially
          as some years have elapsed since the plates of the first editions were
          destroyed, and during all that time applications have been made for
          the work, which could not be supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the advocacy and propagation of the principles here presented, our
          country owes all it possesses of true greatness. American principles
          are, essentially, Baptist principles, and this is owing to the fact
          that Baptist principles have impressed themselves upon the nation, as
          the only principles consistent with a government divorced from
          ecclesiastical control, and recognizing the universal right to civil
          and religious liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to the recognition and prevalence of these principles, the
          evangelical Paedobaptist churches of our land owe their spirituality
          and moral power, in spite of the inconsistency of infant baptism, the
          legitimate and baneful fruits of which are nipped in the bud by the
          influence of Baptist churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the earnest prayer that the present edition may be as useful, at
          least, as previous ones, in leading Christians of every name to the
          knowledge and practice of Bible truth, the work is commended to the
          blessing of God, and the candid consideration of the reader.
