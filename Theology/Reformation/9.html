          &quot;Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized. . . And
          the Lord added to the church, daily, such as should be saved.&quot;
          Acts 2:41,47
        </p>
        <p>
          All professed Christians, who admit that the Scriptures contain a
          model for church organization, strenuously maintain that the
          denomination with which they are connected, is formed after the
          Scriptural pattern. This is true alike of Episcopalians,
          Presbyterians, Methodists, and all others. But it is abundantly
          evident, that while these denominations are so very dissimilar, they
          cannot all resemble one Scriptural model. It is further evident, that
          some who make pretensions to be &quot;THE CHURCH,&quot; are not
          satisfied to rest their claim to that title, simply on a comparison of
          their organization with the New Testament pattern of a Gospel church,
          but very gladly seek to bring in evidence from other quarters, by
          which they hope to support their cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fathers, Tradition, Expediency, are all pressed into their
          service, to supply the lack of evidence afforded in Scripture; or, as
          is sometimes the case, to nullify and render powerless its direct
          testimony against them. All this I say, is done by those who profess
          to find, in the New Testament alone, a warrant for their
          ecclesiastical systems and organizations. They do not seem to
          perceive, that the very course which they adopt to support their
          claims, affords most conclusive evidence that they are false and vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while some appeal to Tradition, and others to Expediency, it is
          the glory of the Baptists that they act on the principle of the
          sufficiency of the Bible in testing this, as well as all other
          questions relating to religion. Though Jewish antiquity, and the
          Fathers, yield as much or more support to their distinctive features,
          as to those who are most clamorous in demanding submission to them,
          still they prefer to appeal to &quot;the law and to the
          testimony.&quot; I announce, as the Sixth Feature of the reform at
          which Baptists aim, The restoration of the order of the primitive
          churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is certain that primitive church order has been generally
          abandoned, from the fact that so many different organizations exist,
          each claiming to be the gospel church. Now, it is evident that not
          more than one of these dissimilar organizations can be constructed
          after the Scripture model. All that is necessary in testing their
          claims is, to compare them with the New Testament description of a
          gospel church. And any body of Christians that is unwilling to be
          brought to this test must of course give up this claim. Let us
          inquire,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. what was the strict order of the primitive churches? We can only
          obtain satisfactory information on this point from the Word of God.
          The text and its connection present to us the circumstances under
          which the first gospel church was formed. From this it will be
          perceived, that first, the gospel was preached, then repentance and
          baptism were urged upon the hearers; &quot;then they that gladly
          received the Word were baptized; and the same day there were added
          unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfastly
          in the apostles&#x27; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of
          bread, and in prayers. And the Lord added daily to the church such as
          should be saved.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Primitive Churches were composed only of professed believers.
          Those who &quot;gladly received the word.&quot; In all the epistles to
          the churches it will be seen that the members composing them are
          addressed as &quot;believers,&quot; &quot;saints,&quot; &quot;chosen
          ones,&quot; &quot;partakers of like precious faith&quot; with the
          apostles; and even where their sins are spoken of, they are alluded to
          as &quot;brethren,&quot; who had departed from the faith. Dr. Dwight
          says, &quot;There is but one character given in the New Testament to
          those who were church members, and that is the character of
          Christians. There is no mixture of any other character.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Primitive churches were composed only of baptized believers. By
          baptized, I mean immersed believers. &quot;They that gladly received
          his word were immersed.&quot; This is the translation—in the common
          version we have only a transliteration. Let me, on this point, give
          you a few authorities for this translation, as there are some who deny
          its correctness—none, however, of any eminence as scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The learned Bossuet says: &quot;Baptism was performed by plunging. In
          fine, we read not in Scripture that baptism was otherwise
          administered; and we are able to make it appear, that for thirteen
          hundred years baptism was thus administered throughout the whole
          church, as far as possible.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Doddridge says: &quot;&#x27;Buried with him by baptism.&#x27; It
          seems the part of candor to confess that here is an allusion to the
          manner of baptizing by immersion, which was the primitive mode.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          John Wesley says: &quot;&#x27;Buried with him,&#x27; alluding to the
          ancient manner of baptizing by immersion.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitby, author of a Commentary on the New Testament and more than
          forty other learned works, says: &quot;It being so expressly declared
          here, that we are buried with Christ in baptism, by being buried under
          water, and the argument to oblige us to a conformity to his death, by
          dying to sin, being taken from hence; and this immersion being
          observed by all Christians for thirteen centuries; and the change of
          it into sprinkling without any allowance from the Author of this
          institution, being that which the Romanist still urges to justify his
          refusal of the cup to the laity; it were to be wished that this custom
          might be again of general use.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chalmers says: &quot;The original meaning of the word baptism is
          immersion; and we doubt not that the general style of administration
          in the apostles&#x27; days was by an actual submerging of the whole
          body under water.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Archbishop Tillotson says: &quot;Anciently those who were baptized
          were immersed and buried in water, to represent their death to sin;
          and then did rise up out of the water to signify their entrance upon a
          new life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I might go on and fill a volume with similar quotations, from every
          scholar of any note who has ever written upon the subject. In addition
          to this, every lexicon of note gives it a meaning, which signifies
          either an immersion into an element, or a complete overwhelming with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident, also, from the narration of circumstances connected
          with baptism in the New Testament, that immersion was the primitive
          mode.
        </p>
        <p>Christ, when he was baptized, came up out of the water.</p>
        <p>
          When Philip baptized the eunuch, he went down into the water with him,
          in order to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul, in alluding to baptism, twice calls it a burial, and
          once a burial and resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who became members of the primitive churches were admitted by
          immersion; and as none were admitted but believers, none but believers
          were immersed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the Primitive Churches none were admitted to the Lord&#x27;s
          table but those who were immersed. Though they were, at the time of
          their conversion, members of the Jewish nation, or, as a Paedobaptist
          would say, of the Jewish church, and had been circumcised in their
          infancy, still they must be immersed before becoming members, or
          enjoying the privileges of a Christian church. Yes, even though they
          had been proselytes to the Jewish religion, and were circumcised after
          they arrived at maturity, they must still be immersed, when they
          professed faith in Christ, before they could sit down at the
          Lord&#x27;s table. It is admitted by all, to have been the practice of
          the primitive churches, to receive none but the baptized to the
          Lord&#x27;s table.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The primitive churches were independent in their government. All
          the members were on an equality in each church, and each church was on
          the same equality with every other church. There were no bishops, in
          the sense in which that term is used by Roman Catholics,
          Episcopalians, and Methodists. There were no church sessions,
          presbyteries, assemblies, synods, or conferences. Advisory councils,
          having no power to legislate, were sometimes called to give counsel in
          difficult matters. But individual churches possessed supreme authority
          to administer discipline, and transact their own business. The church
          was the highest court of appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Paedobaptists have universally departed from the strict order of
          the Primitive Churches. The first Paedobaptist church was the Church
          of Rome. I presume I need not stop here to show that the Romish church
          does not conform to the Scripture model. All Protestants will affirm
          that she does not; and any one who will read the Bible will be
          convinced of it. Let me remind them, however, that in nothing is her
          dissimilarity to gospel churches more palpably manifest than in her
          infant baptism; and in this thing all Paedobaptists are treading in
          her path, while not one of them is conformed to the New Testament
          pattern. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are not composed of the same materials. They number among
          their members, others than professed believers. Every Paedobaptist
          church holds that the children of believers, when they are baptized,
          are members of the church, and form a part of it. I substantiated this
          assertion by numerous quotations from printed documents, in my lecture
          on the &quot;Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom.&quot; I need not,
          therefore, repeat them here. But I remark, in addition to this, that
          conversion is not necessarily a qualification for membership in most
          Paedobaptist churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Episcopalians, admission to full church privileges is granted to
          those who have been confirmed. The requirements for this service are
          thus stated in their Book of Common Prayer: &quot;The Church has
          thought good to order, that none shall be confirmed but such as can
          say the Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and
          can also answer to such other questions as in the Short Catechism are
          contained.&quot; The conditions of admission being thus made,
          irrespective of personal character, it cannot be expected that the
          Episcopal church will bear a comparison with that of primitive times.
          Indeed, it will be perceived that all that is needed is a good memory,
          in order to be confirmed as a member of that church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Presbyterians acknowledge in their standard, that &quot;the
          visible church consists of all those throughout the world that profess
          the true religion, together with their children.&quot; They further
          say, &quot;Children born within the pale of the visible church, and
          dedicated to God in baptism, are under the inspection and government
          of the church, and are to be taught to read and repeat the Catechism
          the Apostles&#x27; Creed, and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. They are to be
          taught to pray, to abhor sin, to fear God, and to obey the Lord Jesus
          Christ. And when they come to years of discretion, if they be free
          from scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient
          knowledge to discern the Lord&#x27;s body, they ought to be informed
          it is their duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s
          supper.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in all this there is nothing said about regeneration, repentance,
          or faith. The late Dr. Chalmers, a distinguished Presbyterian
          minister, maintained that it was &quot;wrong to say that none but the
          pious should be admitted to partake of the sacraments,&quot; while,
          for the decent regulation of the church, &quot;it is well that the
          visibly profane or profligate are kept away.&quot; As to the duty of a
          minister to the &quot;great majority of our species,&quot; who are
          &quot;neither of the profligate or the pious,&quot; his business is,
          &quot;not to exclude them, but to warn them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A church formed on such principles as these certainly cannot claim to
          be identical with the primitive churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Methodist body, it is held that a religious society is &quot;a
          company of men, having the form and seeking the power of godliness,
          united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation,
          and to watch over one another in the Lord, that they may help each
          other to work out their salvation.&quot; &quot;There is one condition
          previously required of those who desire admission into these
          societies—a desire to flee the wrath to come, and to be saved from
          their sins.&quot; It is well known that persons who give no evidence
          of conversion are often allowed, and even urged, to become &quot;class
          members;&quot; and these &quot;seekers,&quot; as they are termed, are
          admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table. It is not necessary according to
          the Discipline, that a man should give evidence of conversion. It is
          certainly not impossible for unconverted men to fulfill a term of
          probation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus, in almost every Paedobaptist church it may be seen, that
          conversion is not absolutely insisted on as a condition of membership
          on the part of adult applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall we say of their infant membership? We frequently hear
          of the &quot;children of the covenant,&quot; and the &quot;children of
          the church,&quot; from Paedobaptist pulpits, but do we hear anything
          of this kind in the New Testament? Do we find unconverted men
          addressed as members of the church in primitive times, or young
          persons urged to fulfill baptismal vows, made for them by their
          parents, when they were unconscious infants? No, no! We see parents
          urged to bring their children up in &quot;the nurture and admonition
          of the lord,&quot; but we nowhere find this duty enforced by any
          allusion to vows made at the dedication of their children in baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, those who united with the primitive churches came into them
          voluntarily. It was not necessary to look about, and see who were
          &quot;free from scandal,&quot; and tell them that it was &quot;their
          duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s table;&quot; but,
          constrained by the love of Jesus Christ, they voluntarily sought to
          profess his sacred name. &quot;Here is water, what hinders me to be
          baptized?&quot; &quot;If you believe with all your heart, you
          may.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Paedobaptists do not receive their members by the same initiatory
          rite that the primitive churches did. The primitive churches received
          their members by immersion. This was the act by which they publicly
          &quot;put on Christ&quot; before the world. A great many Paedobaptist
          authors acknowledge that the primitive saints were immersed, and that
          immersion is the proper signification of the terms which are used to
          designate the ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to those already quoted, I remark that Calvin says:
          &quot;Here we perceive how baptism was administered among the
          ancients; for they immersed the whole body in water.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Taylor says: &quot;The custom of the ancient churches was not
          sprinkling, but immersion; in pursuance of the sense of the word in
          the commandment, and the example of our blessed Savior.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we know that Paedobaptist churches receive the majority of their
          members, not by immersion, but by sprinkling. Some may be immersed,
          but it is only after every argument to dissuade them from it has
          failed. The practice of these churches is sprinkling, the exceptions
          are immersion. In the primitive churches there was &quot;one Lord, one
          faith, one baptism;&quot; and that was immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is a striking dissimilarity between all Paedobaptist
          churches and the primitive churches. The latter were composed of
          immersed believers. The former are composed of a mixed multitude of
          believers and unbelievers, sprinkled, poured, and immersed. The
          language addressed to the primitive churches cannot be addressed to
          them. &quot;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
          put on Christ.&quot; Have infants put on Christ? &quot;Therefore we
          are buried with him by baptism into death.&quot; Can any Paedobaptist
          minister address his church thus? &quot;Buried with him in baptism,
          wherein also you are risen with him through faith of the operation of
          God.&quot; Can this language be appropriately addressed to a
          Paedobaptist church? No! so far from it, many Paedobaptists do not
          like to read it in their Bibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still further; a Paedobaptist preacher cannot stand up, in a
          Paedobaptist community, and address unconverted men as the primitive
          disciples did: &quot;Repent, and be baptized, every one of you.&quot;
          They have been baptized, as they call it, already. From all this it is
          evident that Paedobaptist churches are very dissimilar to the churches
          in the times of the apostles, and to the teachings of the New
          Testament.
        </p>

          3. There is a wide dissimilarity between Paedobaptist churches and the
          primitive churches, in reference to the Lord&#x27;s Supper. In the
          primitive churches, all who were baptized, and members of the church,
          were admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table. None, who were considered
          proper subjects of baptism, and who had received that rite, were
          excluded from the communion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Paedobaptists contend that infants are proper subjects of baptism,
          and that sprinkling is the proper mode. Every infant who is sprinkled,
          then, according to their view, is properly baptized, and is a member
          in the visible church and ought, according to their own reasoning, to
          be admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paedobaptists are most inveterate closed communionists. They are very
          eloquent against the bigotry and closeness of the Baptists, for not
          admitting members of Paedobaptist churches to the Lord&#x27;s table;
          but surely they should not expect us to receive persons whom we
          consider unbaptized, when they will not receive their own baptized
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          All whom we consider baptized, and who are members of our churches, we
          receive; so did the primitive churches. But Paedobaptists have large
          numbers, whom they consider baptized members of their churches, whom
          they do not admit to the Lord&#x27;s table. This is a kind of
          &quot;closed communion&quot; that we have never practiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is a dissimilarity in the government of Paedobaptist churches
          and the primitive churches. One was independent; the other is
          arbitrary, despotic, and tyrannical. I exhibited this fully in my
          lecture on the &quot;Equality of Christ&#x27;s Disciples,&quot; and
          therefore need not repeat the arguments here.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Baptists aim to Restore the Order of the Primitive Churches. They
          make no appeal to Tradition, the Fathers, or Expediency. They simply
          ask, &quot;What do the Scriptures teach?&quot; They follow the New
          Testament model of a church, and invite all to test them by it. It is
          not strange, therefore, that they confidently appeal to God&#x27;s
          Word for proof of the correctness of all they do. They take it all
          from the Bible, and therefore they know it can all be found there.
          Take any Scripture account of the course pursued by the apostles, or
          of the practice of gospel churches, and you will find the counterpart
          in a Baptist church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, they are composed of immersed believers.
          Show us an instance of the baptism of an infant in the primitive
          churches, and we will then baptize infants. But until you do, we will
          oppose infant baptism as an innovation of man, having no divine
          authority, and therefore sinful, when performed in the name of
          Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, Baptists admit none to the Lord&#x27;s
          table but those who are immersed on profession of their faith. Show us
          an instance of a gospel church doing otherwise, and we will conform to
          the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, Baptists are independent in their
          government. Show us a pope, or bishop, or conference, or synod, or
          presbytery, or council, authorized to govern the church, and we will
          submit to just such authority as you can show us in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our position in these matters is illustrated by a narrative contained
          in a tract, published by the American Tract Society, entitled
          &quot;Mick Healy, the Bible Reader.&quot; Mick had been a strict Roman
          Catholic for fifty years. One day he accidentally found a Bible, and
          commenced reading it. The more he read, the more he neglected the
          Romish service. The priest at length heard of it, and visited Mick,
          and sought to get the Bible from him. Failing in this, he began to
          expostulate with him. He told him he must not read it any more; and
          reminding him that he had not been to confession for a long time, he
          told him he must come and confess, for it was his duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mick held out the Bible to the priest, and said, &quot;Will your
          reverence please show it to me in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is just what we say to all the arguments of Paedobaptists.
          They tell us that all Christian parents should have their infant
          children sprinkled. We say, &quot;Will you please show it to us in the
          Book.&quot; They tell us that sprinkling will do as well as to go
          &quot;down into the water,&quot; and be &quot;buried in baptism,&quot;
          and &quot;come up out of the water.&quot; We say, &quot;Will you
          please show it to us in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time, Mick united with a Protestant church, and regularly
          attended the Sunday-school. The children used frequently to gather
          round him, and put questions to him, to hear his answers:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Well, Mick, why don&#x27;t you now pray to the Virgin
          Mary?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Because it is not in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why don&#x27;t you now confess your sins to Peter and Paul,
          Mick?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Because it is not in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why do you believe the Bible to be sufficient to make you wise
          unto salvation, without tradition?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, sure, it is all in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Must everything in religion be proved by the Bible, Mick?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Yes; whatever is not so, is only moonshine.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          Now our Paedobaptist friends ask us why we do not sprinkle infants; we
          reply, &quot;It is not in the Book!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They wish to know why we &quot;go down into the water,&quot; and
          immerse those who believe, and &quot;come up out of the water.&quot;
          We reply, with Mick, &quot;Oh, sure, it is all in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They ask us why we do not admit to the Lord&#x27;s table those who are
          unbaptized. We reply, &quot;It is not in the Book; and whatever is not
          in the Book is only moonshine.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to be Bible Christians, and to make our churches Bible
          churches. In upholding Baptist sentiments, we simply aim to perpetuate
          primitive Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We resemble the primitive Christians in another respect—we are
          &quot;everywhere spoken against.&quot; This we expect, so long as men
          follow Tradition rather than the Word of God, and are influenced by
          the teachings of men, rather than by the example of Christ. But, when
          the Bible, and especially the Bible faithfully translated, is made the
          standard, then we shall triumph. We make no arrogant assumptions; we
          utter no idle boast; but we simply use the language of humble
          confidence and firm faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The progress of the Baptist denomination can be arrested only by
          taking the Bible away from the people; for, while they possess that,
          in spite of priests and princes, scaffolds and faggots, tortures and
          death—some will be found, as in all ages some have been found, who
          will contend for primitive simplicity, primitive purity, primitive
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Paedobaptism can only succeed by withholding the
          Bible from the people, or veiling the command to be immersed in an
          unknown tongue, or calling human tradition to support it, and
          enlisting carnal weapons to defend it. But its days are numbered; it
          is in its decline. Its end approaches; and soon will be heard the
          vocal shout, &quot;Babylon the great is fallen, fallen,&quot; and
          Rome, and all that is Romish, infant baptism and all, shall be
          destroyed! And so let it be!
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not imagine, from these remarks, that I cherish any feelings of
          animosity toward those who practice infant baptism. No; far from it, I
          sincerely pity them. Especially do I pity the priests and ministers
          who are engaged in defending it. So much labor in vain—so much pains
          for nothing. Has not Christ said, &quot;Every plant which my heavenly
          Father has not planted shall be rooted up!&quot; Oh, how much better
          to come out on Gospel ground, take the Bible and follow Christ, and
          enjoy the sweet and abiding confidence that you have done what is
          right!
