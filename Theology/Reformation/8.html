            Establishment of the Correct Principle of Biblical Translation</em

        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;And the Lord answered me and said: Write the vision and make it
          plain upon tables, that he may run who reads it.&quot; Habakkuk 2:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          God&#x27;s solicitude for man&#x27;s well-being and eternal salvation
          is truly wonderful. Having made a revelation of his will, he is
          anxious that no ambiguity or indefiniteness should obscure his
          commands from his erring creatures. He wishes to afford to ruined man,
          all the advantages possible, in order that he may be saved from the
          fearful consequences of his sin and guilt. Hence, he has not involved
          his duty in mist and uncertainty, but, on the contrary, he has
          revealed plainly all his moral requirements and positive institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, he has expressly commanded those to whom is
          committed the great work of transcribing his will for others, to do it
          so plainly, that every duty may be recognized with such ease,
          &quot;that he may run that reads it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But alas! alas! the express command of Jehovah has been violated, and
          his benevolent designs toward our race in a measure frustrated, by the
          efforts of those with whom the advancement of sect, and the
          propagation of human dogmas, is of more importance than the glory of
          God and the salvation of souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Translators have not scrupled to bow to the mandate of kings, the
          dictation of councils, the restrictions of Bible Society boards, and
          the promptings of sectarian prejudices, until the bare enunciation of
          the principle contained in the text, has come to be denounced as
          sectarianism; and faithful obedience to the plain requirements of
          Jehovah in this respect, is assailed as a close and narrow bigotry.
          This state of things calls loudly for reform. I present, then, as the
          Fifth Feature of the reform at which Baptists aim, The establishment
          of the correct principle of biblical translation.
        </p>
        <p>In presenting this theme, let us inquire,</p>
        <p>
          I. What is the Correct Principle on which Translations of the Holy
          Scriptures should be made? To this I reply, that they should be
          conformed, as nearly as possible, to the inspired originals. Let it be
          remembered, that the Bible which we possess is a translation. The
          words of our English version are invested with Divine authority, only
          so far as they express just what the original expresses. I present
          this thought because there is, in the minds of many, a superstitious
          reverence for the words and phrases of our English version. This being
          a translation, partakes more or less of the imperfections of the
          translators; and, in every instance where the original is not clearly
          and fully translated, it is the word of man, and not the Word of God.
          The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew, and the New
          Testament in Greek. In translating, therefore, into English, or
          Burmese, or French, or Berman, or Bengali, or any other language—it is
          evident to anyone, that the Hebrew and the Greek should be the
          standard to which these translations should be conformed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is further evident, that every word that is capable of being
          translated, should be rendered into any other language so as to
          express just what the original did to those to whom it was given.
          There must be no transliteration of a Hebrew or Greek word into
          English or Burmese, for such a word would be unintelligible to the
          mere English or Burmese reader; and he must wait until someone, who
          understands these languages, shall come and explain to him the meaning
          of such words. Let me illustrate:
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose an aged father, a Frenchman, writes a letter of instructions
          to his children and grandchildren, just as the former are about to
          emigrate to the United States. The letter is written in the French
          language, and is readily understood by the children. But the
          grandchildren grow up in ignorance of the French language, though they
          understand the English very well. Their parents die and leave the
          letter in their possession. In order to understand it, they must have
          it translated. Now suppose the person employed to translate, leaves
          here and there a word in French—untranslated. Those words would be
          unintelligible to them. They would be transliterated, not translated.
          In order to be a good translation, the letter must express in English,
          just what the original expressed in French.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so with the Scriptures; the correct principle of translating them
          is to make them speak to all the nations just what they spoke to those
          who had them from the hand of God—just what the originals express.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this principle is correct, is evident, also, from the fact that
          all Protestants, in discussions, appeal not to the translations that
          have been made, but to the original. They regard the original only as
          the standard. In the Westminster Assembly&#x27;s Confession of Faith
          we find the following: &quot;The Old Testament in Hebrew, (which was
          the native language of the people of God of old,) and the New
          Testament in Greek, (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most
          generally known to the nations,) being immediately inspired by God,
          and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are
          therefore authentic; so as, in all controversies of religion, the
          church is finally to appeal unto them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is the practice of all Protestants. It is evident, then, that
          all translations should be made to conform to the original, which is
          the standard of appeal. But I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This Principle has been Generally Abandoned. There is no Bible
          Society, supported by Paedobaptists, that is pledged to the faithful
          translation of the Word of God from the inspired originals. In England
          and America the English version, which is acknowledged to have many
          defects, is made the standard, instead of the original. Nor is this
          all. Even this is not translated fully into the heathen tongues—some
          words are transliterated, not translated. They are perfectly
          incomprehensible to those who read them until someone comes and
          explains them, and he may explain them just to suit his own views.
        </p>
        <p>
          The British and Foreign Bible Society of England, composed of all
          evangelical denominations, passed a resolution, on the 1st July, 1883,
          virtually declining aid to translators of the Bible in foreign
          languages, unless &quot;the Greek terms relating to baptism be
          rendered, either according to the principles adopted by the
          translators of the authorized English version, by a word derived from
          the original, or by such terms as may be considered unobjectionable by
          the other denominations of Christians composing the Bible
          Society.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been the practice of the missionaries to translate these words,
          as well as all others. Now you perceive the resolution does not charge
          them with unfaithful translation, neither does it charge them to
          faithfully render the words into the language of the heathen; but it
          requires them to adopt the principle of the English translators, which
          was to transliterate and not translate certain words, which, if
          translated, would not yield that support to infant baptism which the
          transliteration of them does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The American Bible Society, composed of all evangelical denominations,
          in February, 1836, passed the following preamble and resolution:
          &quot;As the managers are now called to aid extensively in circulating
          the sacred Scriptures in languages other than the English, they deem
          it their duty in conforming with the obvious spirit of their compact,
          to adopt the following resolution as the rule of their conduct in
          making appropriations for the circulation of the Scriptures in all
          foreign tongues:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That in appropriating money for the translating,
          printing or distributing the Sacred Scriptures in foreign languages,
          the managers feel at liberty to encourage only such versions as
          conform, in the principles of their translations, to the common
          English version; at least so far, as that all the religious
          denominations represented in this Society can consistently use and
          circulate said versions to their several schools and
          communities.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, again, you perceive there is an abandonment of the correct
          principle. That principle requires a faithful translation from the
          original. But the resolution just quoted requires that the English
          version, which, as I have before stated, is acknowledged to contain
          errors of translation, be made the standard. And even this is to be
          conformed to, only so far as that &quot;all the denominations
          represented in the Society&quot; can consistently use the versions
          made from it. These two societies represent pretty nearly the entire
          Protestant world in England and America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now anyone will perceive, that while such resolutions were in force,
          no missionary, who was governed by them, could attempt to faithfully
          translate from the original into the languages of the heathen.
          Consequently if a word occurred in the Greek which, if translated,
          would not suit all denominations, it must be transliterated—and then
          the heathen could not understand it until it was explained by a
          missionary, and he might explain it just to suit his own creed.
          Instead, then, of having God&#x27;s Word, which they would have, if
          the original was translated, they have in every instance, only the
          word of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me, before I leave this division of my subject, exhibit the evils
          of this course. No principle that is correct can be violated without
          evil results. We have seen that the correct principle of Biblical
          translation is violated by all Paedobaptist organizations; we may
          therefore look for evil as its legitimate fruit. The principle on
          which they act is, that it is right to make such versions, and such
          only, as shall teach Paedobaptist sentiments. Because Baptists refused
          to transliterate Greek words into the heathen tongues, and insisted on
          translating them, they were thrust out. But, in order to make the
          Bible teach Paedobaptism, the translations must be mutilated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now look at the fruits of this in heathen lands. The first
          missionaries, and the first Bible translators, were Baptists. Hence,
          the first versions made in heathen tongues were faithful translations.
          After these translations had been circulated, the Paedobaptist
          missionaries began to circulate their versions, in which words
          relating to baptism, and other words, were transliterated. The heathen
          convert, when he read the translated word, could understand it, and
          knew what to do. But when he read the transliterated word, he could
          not understand it; he must wait until he could find a teacher to tell
          him what it meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he met a Baptist missionary, he would tell him that the word meant
          to immerse. Then be would ask, &quot;Why does it not read so?&quot;
          What could the missionary say? He would have to say, &quot;The
          translator who produced that version was bound by his Bible Society to
          put that word in.&quot; And if pressed for a reason for this, he must
          tell him of all the differences and disputes among Christians at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          But suppose he meets a Paedobaptist. He tells him it means to pour, or
          it means to sprinkle. But the convert would ask him, &quot;Why not put
          it so? We have words in our language which mean to pour or
          sprinkle.&quot; What would he say? He must give a reason; and he could
          assign no reason which would not awaken the suspicion of the converted
          pagan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another case. A Baptist mission has been established; all has
          been harmonious. A transliterated version falls into the hands of the
          people, and at once all is confusion and distrust, and the cause of
          Christ is arrested. I present these cases, because it has generally
          been represented by Paedobaptists, that the Baptists have introduced
          controversy among the heathen nations on this subject; whereas, just
          the reverse of this is the case. It could not be otherwise; for the
          Baptists were the first to occupy heathen ground, and they had
          translated the Scriptures into many languages before a Paedobaptist
          transliteration version was made. On these Paedobaptists rests the
          guilt, not only of mutilating God&#x27;s Word, but, through this
          means, of reviving, on heathen shores, those dissensions which have
          distracted and retarded the cause of the Redeemer at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, another evil of this course is, that it leads to the
          circulation of versions that teach known and soul-destroying errors.
          It will be perceived that the rule governing Paedobaptists is one of
          expediency. They do not require that the Word of God be faithfully
          translated, but that it be made to suit the majority. All the
          translator has to do is, to ascertain what is expedient. It may be
          expedient to transliterate other words, and the rule adopted does not
          prevent him from doing it. This word may refer to faith, or something
          else that is fundamental, and the withholding of which may peril the
          soul. But I need not dwell on what might be; I will simply show what
          is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spanish Testament employs the words, &quot;Hacer penitencia,&quot;
          as the translation of the Greek word metanoew, to express the duty of
          repentance as enjoined in the original. But these words signify
          &quot;to do penance,&quot; and are thus understood by the Spaniards
          themselves. When they wish to express our idea of repentance, they use
          the word &quot;arrepentirse.&quot; Yet this version is circulated and
          sustained by the American Bible Society. But how did they come to
          translate it so? Simply by abandoning the correct principle of
          Biblical translation. Instead of taking the Hebrew and the Greek as
          the standard, they took the Latin Vulgate, which is a Roman Catholic
          version, and translated from that; and, as expediency was their rule,
          they found it expedient to suit the Catholics; and therefore the Pope
          permits it to be used, while he is mortally opposed to Protestant
          versions of the Holy Scriptures; and thus the money of Protestants is
          taken to promote Romanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me here state another fact, that should make the ears of every
          Paedobaptist tingle with shame. While the American Bible Society was
          circulating this Catholic version, with money contributed by
          Protestants, they refused to aid, as they had been doing, the
          Baptists, in faithfully translating the Word of God, though they were
          generous contributors to their funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same Spanish version, printed and circulated by the American
          Bible Society, Hebrews 11:21, reads thus: &quot;By faith, Jacob, about
          to die, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped the top
          of his staff.&quot; The idea conveyed to the mind of a Roman Catholic
          by this verse is the worship of an image on the top of his staff; and
          thus absolute idolatry is sanctioned and propagated by the Society
          which, with holy horror, withdraws its aid from Baptist missionaries,
          because they would translate all the Word of God, the words relating
          to baptism not excepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we push our reasoning a little further. Suppose the Paedobaptists
          only claim the right to transliterate the words relating to baptism.
          If they have a right to do this, then any denomination has a right to
          transliterate those words, which, if translated, would be fatal to its
          peculiar views.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Roman Catholic may transliterate the Greek word metanoew and have
          Luke 13:3 read, &quot;Except you metanoeo, you shall all likewise
          perish;&quot; and the priest can explain it to &quot;do penance;&quot;
          and the Pope might contribute to the support of a Bible Society that
          would agree to transliterate every word that does not suit him when
          translated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Unitarian may transliterate Qeos, and have John 1:1 read, &quot;In
          the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word
          was theos;&quot; and the minister can explain it to mean &quot;a
          superior, intelligent creature.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Universalist may transliterate aiwnion, teleutaw, etc., and have
          Matthew 25:26 read, &quot;These shall go away into aionion
          punishment;&quot; and the minister can explain it to mean &quot;the
          grave!&quot; Or they can have Mark 9:44 read, &quot;Where their worm
          never dies, and the fire is not sbennutai.&quot; Then the preacher can
          explain it to mean, &quot;where their worm &#x27;troubles&#x27; not
          and the fire is not &#x27;hurtful.&#x27;&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this would be as justifiable, as for the Paedobaptist to
          transliterate baptizw, and then explain it to suit his own views. And
          further, if Paedobaptists have a right to withhold a part of
          God&#x27;s Word, because a part is opposed to their teachings, then
          Rome has a right to withhold all, because all is opposed to her
          teachings; and again Protestantism is found bolstering up Popery. I
          proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          Iii. The Baptists aim to restore and establish the principle of the
          text. Baptists only desire to know and to teach God&#x27;s
          commands—and they desire that all others may know them. They aim,
          therefore, in giving the Bible to the world, to follow the Divine
          requirement given. in the text: &quot;Write the vision and make it
          plain, that he may run who reads it.&quot; In all their efforts to
          spread the Gospel, they have endeavored faithfully to translate the
          Word of God, from the original, into the language of the people;
          seeking to make it so plain, that if a copy of their translation
          should fall into the hands of a person who has no living teacher near
          him, he could ascertain from it all the commands of God. The
          instructions given to their missionaries by the Baptist Board of
          Foreign Missions, are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That the Board feel it to be their duty to adopt all
          prudent measures to give to the heathen the pure Word of God in their
          own language, and to furnish their missionaries with all the means in
          their power to make their translations as exact a representation of
          the mind of the Holy Spirit as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That all the missionaries of the Board who are, or who
          shall be, engaged in translating the Scriptures, be instructed to
          endeavor, by earnest prayer and diligent study, to ascertain the
          precise meaning of the original text, to express that meaning as
          exactly as the nature of the languages into which they shall translate
          the Bible will permit, and to transliterate no words which are capable
          of being literally translated&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What a contrast does this present to the resolutions adopted by the
          Paedobaptists! To this principle of faithful translation, the Baptists
          have always strenuously adhered. Efforts have been made to induce
          their missionaries to abandon it, but these have been in vain. When
          their versions have been translated, and ready for the press, money
          has been offered to print, if they would conceal a part of God&#x27;s
          Word, by transliteratering certain words.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 17th of April, 1836, at a meeting of the managers of the
          American Bible Society, the sum of $5,000 was appropriated to the
          Baptist Board of Foreign Missions, to promote the circulation of the
          Scriptures in foreign tongues, which &quot;money would be paid over,
          if our foreign versions were conformed, in the principles of their
          translation, to the common English version;&quot; that is,
          transliterate, and not translate, the words relating to baptism. The
          grant was conscientiously refused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Efforts of a similar kind were made by the British and Foreign Bible
          Society to procure the transliteration of the words in the Bengali
          version. But all was in vain; the Baptists loved the correct principle
          too well to abandon it for the hope of a mere temporary advantage,
          which would, in the end, paralyze their efforts in the conflict with
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these versions of the Baptists had been proved unfaithful, it would
          have been different; there would then have been some show of reason in
          the course pursued by the Paedobaptists. This, however, was not the
          case; their great defect was, that they were not so mutilated as to
          make it possible for Paedobaptists to teach their views to the
          heathen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, if Baptists had mutilated God&#x27;s Word to make it teach their
          own sentiments, it would have been different. But they were never
          guilty of this, nor have they even been charged with it. How then did
          the Paedobaptists seek to justify themselves? Why, they raised the cry
          that they were sectarian versions; which, when examined, simply means,
          that the faithful translation of God&#x27;s Word teaches just what
          Baptists practice, and condemns the practice of Paedobaptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, neither smiles nor frowns, threats nor bribes, flattery nor
          slander—can move us from our attachment to God&#x27;s Word, and our
          obedience to his requirement to give his will, faithfully translated,
          to all the nations of the earth. Our conflict with error may be long,
          but we have no doubts as to the final outcome. God has honored, and
          will honor, those that honor him; and in no way can we honor him more
          highly than in a firm and constant adherence to faithful translations
          of his Holy Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what I have submitted, it will be perceived that sprinkling and
          infant baptism, have led to this desire for the mutilation of
          God&#x27;s Word; and that those who adhere to this perversion of
          God&#x27;s ordinance, are giving their sanction to the abandonment of
          the correct principle of Biblical translation. Their example, their
          influence, and their money, go to support these mutilated versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, I remark, that the Paedobaptist rule of non-translation of
          certain words, like their appeal to tradition, paralyzes their power
          to combat Humanism. How can they condemn the Popish practice of
          denying the Bible to the people, when they adopt the very principle of
          Popery? The Roman Catholic priest can say: &quot;We only keep back
          what is opposed to our practice, and you, Paedobaptists do the
          same.&quot; What could a Protestant Paedobaptist translator say to
          this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, this question about baptism is not so insignificant, seeing it
          involves such great consequences! If the magnitude of a thing is to be
          judged of by its results, it is certain that the question of baptism
          is one of vast importance. As such, I urge the investigation of it
          upon every honest man. At all events, from the printed resolutions
          which I have quoted, all must perceive that the correct principle of
          Biblical translation is with the Baptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding this lecture, I invite your attention to one or two
          inferences from the text: &quot;Write this vision and make it plain,
          that he may run who reads it.&quot; I infer, that all we are to
          believe and practice is made plain in the Word of God, unless obscured
          in the translation. Infant baptism, therefore, either was never
          commanded by Jehovah, or else it has been obscured in the translation
          of his Word; for none, with the teaching of the Bible alone would ever
          discover it to be their duty to have children baptized. Those,
          therefore, who practice infant baptism, ought strenuously to contend
          for a faithful translation, that the obscurity which conceals this
          duty from the common reader may be removed. But I find that
          Paedobaptists oppose faithful translations; I therefore conclude that
          God never commanded infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          I infer, again, that we are to follow that which is plainly taught in
          the Bible, rather than what is doubtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romanist may tell me that I ought to pray to the Virgin Mary, and
          seek the intercession of the saints; but while I read the plain
          declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;There is one God, and one
          Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,&quot; I will
          follow the Bible, and let the Roman Catholic go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Unitarian may tell me, that Christ is not God; but while I read
          the plain declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;I and my Father are
          one,&quot; &quot;He who has seen me, has seen the Father,&quot; I will
          follow the Bible, and let the Unitarian go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Universalist may tell me that there will be no future punishment;
          but while I read the plain declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;these
          shall go away into everlasting punishment,&quot; I will follow the
          Bible, and let the Universalist go.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, the Paedobaptist may tell me that infants ought to be
          baptized; but while I read the plain declaration, &quot;He who
          believes and is baptized, shall be saved,&quot; &quot;Repent, and be
          baptized every one of you,&quot; I will follow the Bible and let the
          Paedobaptist go. Our duty is plain; for God has said, &quot;Write the
          vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run who reads
          it.&quot;
