            Restoration of the Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>&quot;My kingdom is not of this world&quot; John 18:36</p>
        <p>
          There was much misapprehension, during the ministry of Christ on the
          earth, concerning the nature of that kingdom which he was about to
          establish. It was most generally supposed, that it would be a temporal
          kingdom, differing from others only in its superior external splendor,
          its brilliant warlike achievements, and its universal extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this false idea, that so perplexed Herod, at the announcement
          of the birth of the infant Savior. It was this false idea that led the
          Jews to reject their Messiah, when he appeared among them in the
          character of the meek and lowly One. It was this false idea that led
          the disciples, just before the ascension of Christ, to ask,
          &quot;Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to
          Israel?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The principles to which the Savior gave utterance, were calculated to
          remove these false impressions from the minds of all who had imbibed
          them. He taught his followers to nourish a spirit of self-denial, and
          humility, and peace. Every act of his life, and every word of his
          lips, bore testimony to the fact that he came not to set up an earthly
          empire, but a spiritual kingdom. And when he uttered the words of the
          text, &quot;My kingdom is not of this world,&quot; he simply gave an
          exposition of the principles he had been teaching during his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostles were enlightened by the Holy Spirit on the day of
          Pentecost, they understood perfectly the nature of this declaration;
          and hence, they admitted none to visible membership in the gospel
          kingdom but those who gave evidence of repentance, and faith in
          Christ. They taught that the church of which Jesus is the Head, was a
          spiritual organization, composed not of those who came into it by
          hereditary descent, but of those who were born of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, there has been a departure from these principles; and
          organizations now exist, under the designation of Christian churches,
          which aim to unite the church and the world, and introduce the
          impious, and ungodly, and profane, into Christ&#x27;s kingdom—thus
          reversing his declaration, that his &quot;kingdom is not of this
          world.&quot; Against this innovation Baptists strenuously protest. We
          announce, then, as the Second Feature of the reform in which Baptists
          are engaged,
        </p>
        <p>The Restoration of the Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom.</p>
        <p>
          Let us inquire here, How is it, that the principle expressed in the
          text came to be violated? How does it happen, that others than those
          possessing the qualifications demanded by the Gospel, come to have a
          place in Christ&#x27;s professedly visible kingdom? How does it
          happen, that what is professedly Christ&#x27;s church, is the
          receptacle of the godless and the vile? I reply, simply through the
          introduction of the unscriptural rite of infant baptism!
        </p>
        <p>
          So long as the church followed the direction of her Lord, and baptized
          into her membership only those who gave evidence of faith—so long she
          retained her spirituality; but when she permitted tradition to add to
          the Word of God, and received into her membership infants, who grew up
          in sin and unbelief—then her spirituality was exchanged for
          worldliness; then she introduced a traitor into the citadel, who
          betrayed her into the hands of her enemies. In contending, then, for
          the baptism of believers only, we aim at the restoration of the
          principle expressed by the Savior in the words of the text: &quot;My
          kingdom is not of this world.&quot; I shall endeavor to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That Infant Baptism tends to the Violation of this Principle. It is
          an undeniable fact, that all Paedobaptist churches have contended that
          infants are proper subjects for membership in the church, and
          therefore should be baptized. There are two opinions, however, as to
          the grounds of infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some contend that the infants of professed believers should be
          baptized because they are already members of the church, by their
          natural birth. Others contend that they should be baptized in order to
          make them members. All Paedobaptists, however, agree, that infants are
          proper subjects for church membership, and by baptism they receive
          such to their membership. This is true, not only of the Church of
          Rome, but of all the Protestant Paedobaptist denominations, as can
          easily be shown by their Confessions of Faith and writings on the
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Episcopal minister, at the baptism of an infant, says: &quot;We
          receive this child into the congregation of Christ&#x27;s flock.&quot;
          And again: &quot;Seeing that this child is regenerate, and grafted
          into the body of Christ&#x27;s church.&quot; And in the prayer he
          thanks God that it has pleased him &quot;to regenerate this infant,
          and incorporate him into his holy church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The 17th article of the Methodist Episcopal Church says: &quot;Baptism
          is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
          Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized, but it
          is also a sign of regeneration, or the new birth. The baptism of young
          children is to be retained in the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Confession of Faith, chapter 25 section 2 says:
          &quot;The visible church consists of all those throughout the world
          that profess the true religion, together with their children.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told again in the Westminster Larger Catechism, question 165,
          that &quot;Baptism is a sacrament,&quot; &quot;whereby the parties
          baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible church.&quot;
          &quot;All baptized persons are members of the church, are under its
          care, and subject to its government and discipline, and when they have
          arrived at years of discretion, they are bound to perform all the
          duties of church members.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the doctrine of all Paedobaptist denominations. Those baptized
          in infancy are considered as sustaining the relation of church
          members. The propriety of this relation is urged in every possible
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Says one writer, &quot;Infants may be the disciples of Christ. A
          disciple is a scholar; this is the meaning of the word. And a child is
          a scholar before he learns his lesson, as well as afterwards. He is
          reckoned a scholar when he is committed to the care of the instructor,
          or has his name put down with those who belong to the school whether
          he puts his name down himself, or whether his parents put it down for
          him. The church is the school of Christ. The names of all those to
          whom God&#x27;s gracious covenant [baptism] is applied, belong upon
          the records of the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is plainly taught that infants, by their baptism, are not only
          admitted into the church, but actually made disciples of Christ.
          Surely, Mr. Arnold had forgotten what Christ said, when he wrote the
          above: &quot;If any man will be MY disciple, let him deny himself, and
          take up his cross, and follow me.&quot; However, I did not introduce
          this extract to combat it in this place, but simply to show that
          Paedobaptists contend for infant membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another writer says: &quot;This relation of children to the church is
          generally represented, by the most respectable authors, as infant
          membership. Against this I can see no valid objections. In a very
          important, though in a very qualified sense, baptized children may be
          considered as infant members of the Christian church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Says Dr. McDowell: &quot;By baptism children become members of
          Christ&#x27;s visible church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          From these quotations, (and they might be increased indefinitely) it
          will be clearly seen that infants become members of Paedobaptist
          churches by baptism; and these infants are the constituent elements of
          which these churches are composed. Having thus been admitted members
          in infancy, they retain their connection with the church after they
          are grown up, however wicked and abandoned they may become. Though
          they are sometimes guilty of such vile crimes as to merit their
          exclusion from society, and their confinement in the penitentiary,
          still they are not excluded from the church. And though they sometimes
          die under the hand of the public executioner, without any evidence of
          repentance, they die as members of the church into which they were
          baptized. Is not this uniting the church and the world &quot;until
          death does them part?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these remarks apply, more particularly, to national
          churches—all of which are Paedobaptist—as the Romish, Greek, Lutheran
          and English Episcopal, who all receive and retain infant members,
          however wicked they may become, yet the same is true, in some sense of
          all other Paedobaptist churches. Dr. Woods, speaking of the duty of
          the church to its infant members, says: &quot;On the question whether
          the church ever ought, by a public act, to cut off those who give
          evidence of obstinate impiety, there have been various opinions.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is, in my view, utterly inexpedient to attempt to fix upon
          any particular age, at which those who were baptized in infancy, and
          who exhibit no evidence of piety, are to be abandoned by the church,
          as those for whom no further efforts are to be made. For, suppose you
          fix upon the age of eighteen, or twenty, or twenty-one; who can be
          sure that a youth at that age though without any evidence of
          regeneration, may not be in a state of mind which is more susceptible
          of good impressions, and which affords more hope of salvation, than at
          any period of his life before? Now if any person should be in this
          state, and the church should adopt a principle like what I have
          referred to, they must forthwith exclude such a person from all the
          advantages of their Christian friendship; and they must do this at a
          time when those advantages would be most highly prized.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We are not to attend to present appearances; but are to consider
          the forbearance and longsuffering of God, and the multiplied instances
          in which His grace has visited those who had long lived in sin, and
          who, in human apprehension, had been fitted for destruction. And when
          those who have been devoted to God in baptism, wander far and long
          from the path of duty, and show fearful symptoms of obduracy—we are
          not quickly to despair of their salvation, but are to follow them with
          every effort which the sincerest love can dictate. And when no other
          effort seems to promise any good, we are to abound in prayer, relying
          on the infinite grace of God, and earnestly hoping that our prayers
          will prevail and that our children will at length be persuaded to
          consider their ways, and turn to the Lord.&quot; (Lectures on Infant
          Baptism, pages 173-175.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From this it will be perceived that those who are made members of
          Paedobaptist churches in infancy continue such when grown up—that they
          are not to be excluded no matter how ungodly they become, so long as
          hopes may be entertained of their conversion; or, in other words, so
          long as they live. This, we know, is the practice of Paedobaptists
          universally. Is not this uniting the church and the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let it be remembered, that I have thus far confined my remarks to
          the effects of infant membership where only the children of
          professedly pious parents are admitted into the church by their
          baptism in infancy. How much more palpable does this evil appear, when
          we extend our observation to the practice which exists, to a, greater
          or less extent, in almost every Paedobaptist community—of baptizing
          the children of unconverted parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of Paedobaptists do not require piety as a condition in
          the parents, but simply a desire to have their children baptized.
          There is nothing in the standards of any Paedobaptist church that
          actually prohibits the baptism of children of unconverted parents. The
          Presbyterian Confession of Faith appears to prescribe limits, but it
          does not actually do so, nor is it so understood by the ministry of
          that church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Says Dr. McDowell, &quot;Seeing that a person by baptism has become a
          member of the visible church, although destitute of piety, and
          although he gives the church no evidence of visible piety, yet on what
          ground, or in what way can he be kept back from baptism for his child?
          I answer, let him be seriously and solemnly told the nature of
          baptism,&quot; etc. &quot; If this were properly done, it would have a
          great effect in keeping back many improper persons.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I might, if it were necessary, furnish instances where Presbyterian
          ministers have baptized the children of unconverted parents without
          the least hesitation. But the worst feature of all is, that in some
          cases unconverted persons are urged to bring their children to
          baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, however, that in all cases, none but the children of truly
          pious parents were admitted to infant baptism and membership—would
          this remove the evil? Are such children any better than others? No;
          for like all others, they are born with carnal and depraved natures.
          They are of the world—they belong to it; and notwithstanding their
          religious parentage, they are &quot;children of wrath even as
          others,&quot; until regenerated by the Holy Spirit. As they advance
          toward maturity, they exhibit the same enmity to God, and the same
          evil passions, and the same sinful inclinations manifested by others.
          Some of them become notoriously vile, yet they are not to be excluded;
          but they retain their membership, into which they were brought in
          their infancy, and continue in it to the day of their death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is directly opposed to Christ&#x27;s declaration: &quot;My
          kingdom is not of this world.&quot; It is directly opposed to the
          practice of the apostles. It is directly opposed to the New Testament
          description of church members. They are there described as a spiritual
          seed, living stones, saints, sincere believers. But are baptized
          infants of this description? Do they possess the qualities which in
          the New Testament are invariably ascribed to church members? By no
          means. And yet they are received into what are professedly evangelical
          churches; and thus the spirituality of Christ&#x27;s kingdom has been
          destroyed by infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The church of Christ, bought with his blood, and ordained by him
          to be the fold of his sheep, the home of the renewed, in the world but
          not of it—has been robbed of its true design, by being converted into
          a common receptacle for the pure and the impure—a great drag-net,
          inclosing all alike.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Infant baptism tends directly to amalgamate the church with the world.
          It is by means of this, that the church of Rome has spread her baneful
          influence over so many nations. This is abundantly evident from the
          fact, that through the baptism of children she has made whole nations
          nominally Christian, teaching just what all other churches who baptize
          infants teach, that by their baptism they are made members of the
          church of Christ. Thus do Protestant Paedobaptists indorse the false
          teachings of Rome, and give their strength to the Beast, by propping
          up the main pillar on which Antichrist rests! I proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the practice of Baptists is in accordance with the teachings
          of Christ. Baptists regard the kingdom of Christ as a purely spiritual
          organization, separate and distinct from the world. Acting upon this
          conviction, they admit none to baptism and membership, but such as
          profess their faith in Jesus, and give satisfactory evidence that they
          have &quot;passed from death unto life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They recognize no hereditary claims to the covenant of grace. They
          claim no &quot;holiness&quot; for their offspring, arising from their
          natural birth, which entitles them to a place in God&#x27;s spiritual
          temple. But regarding them as carnal, depraved and unholy, they
          constantly feel the importance of urging upon them their own personal
          obligations to &quot;repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus
          Christ,&quot; while infant damnation has no place in their creed, for
          the simple reason that, like infant baptism, its supposed antidote, it
          is not found in the Bible. They aim to show that Christ&#x27;s
          &quot;kingdom is not of this world.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They receive none but professed converts, and when these walk
          disorderly, they withdraw themselves from them. They are laboring to
          reform both Protestant and Papal Christendom on this point, which they
          regard of vital importance to the best interests of the church and the
          world. Let their principles prevail, and there can be no unhallowed
          union of Church and State, no amalgamation of Christ&#x27;s kingdom
          with the world; but the Church, with undimmed luster will shine forth,
          her glory unobscured, her ordinances uncorrupted, and her membership
          uncontaminated, and instead of being &quot;the mistress of the State,
          or the courtesan of the world—as Paedobaptism has in too many
          instances made her—she will appear in all her loveliness as the Bride
          of Christ!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          From these remarks it will be seen, that infant baptism is not that
          harmless, innocent thing which many suppose it to be. Infant baptism
          is the parent of gigantic evils; the fruitful source of the existence
          of state churches, and most of the corruptions flowing therefrom; the
          instigator of all the persecutions which have ever been waged in the
          name of Christianity; a lying refuge and hiding-place of falsehood to
          ensnare and ruin souls. In short, infant baptism is the originator and
          propagator of Popery.

          Infant baptism is an error from beginning to end—corrupt in theory and
          corrupting in practice; born in superstition, cradled in fear, nursed
          in ignorance, supported by fraud, and spread by force! With a tyrant
          hand it has shed the blood of martyrs in torrents in all lands.

          The introduction of infant baptism was the death-knell of religions
          liberty in the Christian communities where it was practiced. The first
          persecutions ever raised in the name of Christianity, were waged by
          the advocates of infant baptism against those who, adhering to the
          teachings of Christ and the apostles, denied its validity.

          The council of Carthage (A.D. 414) passed the following canon:
          &quot;Whoever denies that little children by baptism are freed from
          perdition and eternally saved—that they are accursed.&quot; The edict
          of Honorius and Valentinian III. (A.D. 418) forbids re-baptism
          throughout the Roman empire under the penalty of death. This of course
          was aimed at those who considered infant baptism as unscriptural, and
          immersed believers after they had confessed their faith in Christ,
          even though they had been baptized in infancy. Justinian, in the
          beginning of the sixth century, ordered new-born infants to be
          baptized, under a penalty for neglecting it. Under laws like these,
          enforced as they were in the middle ages with new and most bloody
          edicts in all the states of Europe, what multitudes must have become
          martyrs, may be conjectured from the fact that at the time of the
          Reformation, Baptist martyrs were counted by tens and even hundreds of
          thousands.

          Now, as we love the Word of God, the commands and example of Christ,
          the purity of the Christian Church, and the souls of men—we are bound
          unceasingly to labor for the extermination of this monster evil, this
          child of Tradition! In seeking to effect this reform, we shall use no
          carnal weapons, but simply adhere to the word of God, the precepts of
          Christ, and the practice of the apostles—and urge all others to do the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me urge all to seek from the Bible a knowledge of the
          characteristics of those who composed the primitive churches, and see
          whether they will apply to the constituents of Paedobaptist churches.
          And if not, then &quot;come out from among them,&quot; and aid those
          who are laboring to effect a reform which will restore the
          spirituality of the church, and clothe it with that moral beauty and
          attractiveness of which Paedobaptism has shorn it.

          In concluding this lecture, I cannot refrain from saying a few words
          to those who have been baptized in infancy, and are yet conscious that
          they have never been &quot;born again.&quot; I am induced to do this,
          because I am reminded that my attention was first led to a open
          investigation of the subject of baptism, by discovering that, though
          unconverted, I was a member of the church—having been made so by my
          baptism in infancy. This incongruous position you sustain. Though in
          the world, and of the world—you are also in the church, and of the
          church! You are not responsible, I am aware, for the inconsistency of
          the position you occupy. You were brought into it while in unconscious
          infancy, without your knowledge and consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I inquire, do you not feel that such a relation is perfectly
          inconsistent with your own ideas of what the Bible teaches? A
          moment&#x27;s reflection, I feel confident, if you are really
          Protestants, will convince you of it. At all events, I urge you, as
          Protestants, to search the Bible in reference to this matter, with the
          hope that you may be led, as I was, to see your unfitness for a place
          in Christ&#x27;s kingdom, and to seek and obtain salvation through
          Jesus Christ, and then act consistently, by uniting with those who aim
          to restore the spirituality of Christ&#x27;s church, by faithfully
          adhering to his own declaration, &quot;My kingdom is not of this
          world.&quot;
