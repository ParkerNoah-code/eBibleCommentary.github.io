        <h2>Atonement</h2>
        <p>
          J. I. Packer, Concise Theology: A Guide to Historic Christian Beliefs
          (Wheaton: Tyndale, 1993), 134: "<em>Atonement</em> means making
          amends, blotting out the offense, and giving satisfaction for wrong
          done; thus reconciling to oneself the alienated other and restoring
          the disrupted relationship."
        </p>
        <p>
          John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian
          Belief (Phillipsburg: P&R, 2013), 901: "Jesus’ atoning sacrifice
          fulfills the OT sacrifices of bulls, goats, lambs, doves, flour, wine,
          and oil. In the OT, God used those sacrifices to teach the people what
          Jesus was later going to do. So we can learn from those sacrifices
          about the meaning of Jesus’ atonement."

        </p>
        <p>
          1. The atonement is grounded in the holiness of God who, being
          perfectly holy, hates and punishes sin.<br />
          2. A penalty for sin must be paid.<br />
          3. People cannot pay the penalty for their sins and live; rather, the
          penalty is death.<br />
          4. Only God can pay the penalty for sin, but he must partake of human
          nature to pay for human beings.<br />
          5. By his death, the God-man, Jesus Christ, atoned for human sin.<br />
          6. The atonement had to be accomplished in this way (“penal
          substitution theory”).

            >What is the doctrine of penal substitution?</a
          >: "In the simplest possible terms, the biblical doctrine of penal
          substitution holds that Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross takes the place
          of the punishment we ought to suffer for our sins. As a result, God’s
          justice is satisfied, and those who accept Christ can be forgiven and
          reconciled to God."

          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 49: "God is a good
          King who loves his creation and is, therefore, opposed to that which
          violates its goodness. Because of his love (not in spite of it), God
          responds to sin... God’s response to sin, therefore, is judgment (2
          Cor. 5:10), punishment (2 Thess. 1:9), wrath (John 3:36), a curse
          (Deut. 11:28), exile (2 Kings 17:6–7), and ultimately death (Rom.
          6:23). This is the penalty of sin."

          J. I. Packer, In My Place Condemned He Stood: Celebrating the Glory of
          the Atonement (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2007), 40–41: "God’s wrath is
          his righteousness reacting against unrighteousness; it shows itself in
          retributive justice. But Jesus Christ has shielded us from the
          nightmare prospect of retributive justice by becoming our
          representative substitute, in obedience to his Father’s will, and
          receiving the wages of our sin in our place."

          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 143,
          148: "It is clear from Old Testament usage that to 'bear sin' means...
          specifically to endure its penal consequences, to undergo its
          penalty... The sinless one was 'made sin for us,' which must mean that
          he bore the penalty of our sin instead of us, and he redeemed us from
          the law’s curse by 'becoming a curse for us,' which must mean that the
          curse of the law lying upon us for our disobedience was transferred to
          him, so that he bore it instead of us."

          <em>taking the consequences of our sins</em>. The biblical assumption
          is that death is the consequence of sin, and therefore Christ takes
          that consequence even though the sin is not his own. In his death,

          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in

          was ours because of sin and gave us what is his by grace. Jesus lived
          the life we could not live, died the death we should have died, and
          rose so that we can have life in him. The King became a servant to
          bring us into his kingdom. And it all hinges on substitution."

          J. I. Packer, In My Place Condemned He Stood: Celebrating the Glory of
          the Atonement (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2007), 37-38: "<em>Blood</em>,
          as we hinted earlier, is a word pointing to the violent death
          inflicted in the animal sacrifices of the old covenant... Along with
          the other New Testament writers, Paul always points to the death of
          Jesus as the atoning event and explains the atonement in terms of
          <em>representative substitution</em>—the innocent taking place of the
          guilty, in the name and for the sake of the guilty, under the axe of
          God’s judicial retribution."

        <p>
          John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian
          Belief (Phillipsburg: P&R, 2013), 904: "First, Scripture teaches that
          sacrifice is required to receive God’s forgiveness: without the
          shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). As we
          have seen, the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23; cf. Ezek. 18:4).
          Second, on this view, God demonstrates the severity of his law by
          putting to death an innocent man. But unless Jesus is a substitute for
          us, his death is a demonstration of injustice, not justice."

          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 68.
          Stott offers a fourfold theory to explain the cross, without which he
          claims the cross remains unintelligible: "that Christ died for us, for
          our good; that the 'good' he died to procure for us was our salvation;
          that in order to procure it he had to deal with our sins; and that in
          dying for them it was our death that he died."

            >Systematic Theology</a
          >, 3.4, The Nature of the Atonement: "There are several passages in
          Scripture which speak of our sins as being "laid upon" Christ, and of
          His "bearing" sin or iniquity, Isa. 53:6,12; John 1:29; II Cor. 5:21;
          Gal. 3:13; Heb. 9:28; I Pet. 2:24. On the basis of Scripture we can,
          therefore, say that our sins are imputed to Christ. This does not mean
          that our sinfulness was transferred to Him — something that is in
          itself utterly impossible — but that the guilt of our sin was imputed
          to Him."

          his penal obedience, then, particularly as the latter came to
          expression in his cross work, is the ground of God's justification of
          sinners (see Rom. 5:9), by which divine act they are
          <em>pardoned</em> (because their sins were charged to Christ who
          obediently bore the law's sanctions against them) and
          <em>accepted as righteous</em> in God's sight (because Christ's
          preceptive obedience or perfect righteousness is imputed to them

          his people from Satan and established himself as the rightful king of
          the cosmos. This view is not exclusive to the penal substitutionary
          view, as can be seen by the presence of both in the writings of
          figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin."

        <p><b>Chapter 8. Of Christ the Mediator</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>1.</b> It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain
          the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, according to the covenant made
          between them both, to be the mediator between God and man;<sup>1</sup>
          the prophet,<sup>2</sup> priest,<sup>3</sup> and king;<sup>4</sup>
          head and savior of the church,<sup>5</sup> the heir of all things,<sup
            >6</sup
          >
          and judge of the world;<sup>7</sup> unto whom He did from all eternity
          give a people to be His seed and to be by Him in time redeemed,
          called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.<sup>8</sup>
          <br />
          (1. Isaiah 42:1; 1 Peter 1:19-20 2. Acts 3:22 3. Hebrews 5:5-6 4.
          Psalms 2:6; Luke 1:33 5. Ephesians 1:22-23 6. Hebrews 1:2 7. Acts
          17:31 8. Isaiah 53:10; John 17:6; Romans 8:30).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4.</b> This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake,<sup
            >21</sup
          >
          which that He might discharge He was made under the law,<sup>22</sup>
          and did perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the punishment due to us,
          which we should have born and suffered,<sup>23</sup> being made sin
          and a curse for us;<sup>24</sup> enduring most grievous sorrows in His
          soul, and most painful sufferings in His body;<sup>25</sup> was
          crucified, and died, and remained in the state of the dead, yet saw no
          corruption:<sup>26</sup> on the third day He arose from the dead<sup
            >27</sup
          >
          with the same body in which He suffered,<sup>28</sup> with which He
          also ascended into heaven,<sup>29</sup> and there sits at the right
          hand of His Father making intercession,<sup>30</sup> and shall return
          to judge men and angels at the end of the world.<sup>31</sup>
          <br />
          (21. Psalms 40:7-8; Hebrews 10:5-10; John 10:18 22. Galatians 4:4;
          Matthew 3:15 23. Galatians 3:13; Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 3:18 24. 2
          Corinthians 5:21 25. Matthew 26:37, 38; Luke 22:44; Matthew 27:46 26.
          Acts 13:37 27. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 28. John 20:25, 27 29. Mark 16:19;
          Acts 1:9-11 30. Romans 8:34; Hebrews 9:24 31. Acts 10:42; Romans
          14:9-10; Acts 1:11; 2 Peter 2:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5.</b> The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of
          Himself, which He through the eternal Spirit once offered up to God,
          has fully satisfied the justice of God,<sup>32</sup> procured
          reconciliation, and purchased an everlasting inheritance in the
          kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given unto
          Him.<sup>33</sup>
          <br />
          (32. Hebrews 9:14, 10:14; Romans 3:25-26 33. John 17:2; Hebrews 9:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>6.</b> Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by
          Christ until after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and
          benefit thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages,
          successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those
          promises, types, and sacrifices wherein He was revealed, and signified
          to be the seed which should bruise the serpent's head;<sup>34</sup>
          and the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,<sup>35</sup>
          being the same yesterday, and today and for ever.<sup>36</sup>
          <br />
          (34. 1 Corinthians 4:10; Hebrews 4:2; 1 Peter 1:10-11 35. Revelation
          13:8 36. Hebrews 13:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>8.</b> To all those for whom Christ has obtained eternal
          redemption, He does certainly and effectually apply and communicate
          the same, making intercession for them;<sup>38</sup> uniting them to
          Himself by His Spirit, revealing to them, in and by His Word, the
          mystery of salvation, persuading them to believe and obey,<sup
            >39</sup
          >
          governing their hearts by His Word and Spirit,<sup>40</sup> and
          overcoming all their enemies by His almighty power and wisdom,<sup
            >41</sup
          >
          in such manner and ways as are most consonant to His wonderful and
          unsearchable dispensation; and all of free and absolute grace, without
          any condition foreseen in them to procure it.<sup>42</sup>
          <br />
          (38. John 6:37, 10:15-16, 17:9; Romans 5:10 39. John 17:6; Ephesians
          1:9; 1 John 5:20 40. Romans 8:9, 14 41. Psalms 110:1; 1 Corinthians
          15:25-26 42. John 3:8; Ephesians 1:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>9.</b> This office of mediator between God and man is proper only
          to Christ, who is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God;
          and may not be either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from
          Him to any other.<sup>43</sup>
          <br />
          (43. 1 Timothy 2:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>10.</b> This number and order of offices is necessary; for in
          respect of our ignorance, we stand in need of His prophetical
          office;<sup>44</sup> and in respect of our alienation from God, and
          imperfection of the best of our services, we need His priestly office
          to reconcile us and present us acceptable unto God;<sup>45</sup> and
          in respect to our averseness and utter inability to return to God, and
          for our rescue and security from our spiritual adversaries, we need
          His kingly office to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and
          preserve us to His heavenly kingdom.<sup>46</sup>
          <br />
          (44. John 1:18 45. Colossians 1:21; Galatians 5:17 46. John 16:8;
          Psalms 110:3; Luke 1:74-75).
        </p>
        <p><b>Chapter 11. Of Justification</b></p>
        <p>
          <b>1.</b> Those whom God effectually calls, he also freely
          justifies,<sup>1</sup> not by infusing righteousness into them, but by
          pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as
          righteous;<sup>2</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by
          them, but for Christ's sake alone;<sup>3</sup> not by imputing faith
          itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to
          them, as their righteousness; but by imputing Christ's active
          obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in his death for
          their whole and sole righteousness by faith,<sup>4</sup> which faith
          they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.<sup>5</sup>
          <br />
          (1. Romans 3:24, 8:30 2. Romans 4:5-8, Ephesians 1:7 3. 1 Corinthians
          1:30-31, Romans 5:17-19 4. Philippians 3:8-9; Ephesians 2:8-10 5. John
          1:12, Romans 5:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2.</b> Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his
          righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification;<sup>6</sup>
          yet is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with
          all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.<sup
            >7</sup
          >
          <br />
          (6. Romans 3:28 7. Galatians 5:6, James 2:17, 22, 26).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the
          debt of all those who are justified; and did, by the sacrifice of
          himself in the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the
          penalty due to them, make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to
          God’s justice in their behalf;<sup>8</sup> yet, in as much as he was
          given by the Father for them, and his obedience and satisfaction
          accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for anything in
          them,<sup>9</sup> their justification is only of free grace, that both
          the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the
          justification of sinners.<sup>10</sup>
          <br />
          (8. Hebrews 10:14; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Isaiah 53:5-6 9. Romans 8:32; 2
          Corinthians 5:21 10. Romans 3:26; Ephesians 1:6-7, 2:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4.</b> God did from all eternity decree to justify all the
          elect,<sup>11</sup> and Christ did in the fullness of time die for
          their sins, and rise again for their justification;<sup>12</sup>
          nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the Holy Spirit
          in time does actually apply Christ to them.<sup>13</sup>
          <br />
          (11. Galatians 3:8, 1 Peter 1:2, 1 Timothy 2:6 12. Romans 4:25 13.
          Colossians 1:21-22, Titus 3:4-7).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5.</b> God continues to forgive the sins of those that are
          justified,<sup>14</sup> and although they can never fall from the
          state of justification,<sup>15</sup> yet they may, by their sins, fall
          under God’s fatherly displeasure;<sup>16</sup> and in that condition
          they usually do not have the light of his countenance restored to
          them, until they humble themselves, beg pardon, and renew their faith
          and repentance.<sup>17</sup>
          <br />
          (14. Matthew 6:12, 1 John 1:7, 9 15. John 10:28 16. Psalms 89:31-33
          17. Psalms 32:5, Psalms 51, Matthew 26:75).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>6.</b> The justification of believers under the Old Testament was,
          in all these respects, one and the same with the justification of
          believers under the New Testament.<sup>18</sup>
          <br />
          (18. Galatians 3:9; Romans 4:22-24).
