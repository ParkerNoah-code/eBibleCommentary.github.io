    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
      resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a second,
      irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. In other words,
      the unrighteous will be finally destroyed by God. Only those who are saved
      through faith in Christ will receive the gift of immortality and eternal
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional belief in the eternal conscious torment of the unsaved,
      whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects our
      interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about "death,"
      "destruction," and "perishing" to be interpreted metaphorically to refer
      to separation from God, pain, or torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are sufficient translational, exegetical, theological, and practical
      considerations to inspire humility and genuine reflection as one studies
      this weighty and important doctrine. Therefore, both sides must be careful
      to avoid reading presuppositions into the Bible or flippantly dismissing
      those who disagree. Proof-texting without regard for context or
      carefulness is irresponsible and unhelpful. A thorough examination of
      passages about the ultimate end of unbelievers is the only way we can
      reach clarity and certainty on the matter.

      face judgment. The judgment will be terrible for them. However, they will
      not suffer eternally. Instead, they will perish (John 3:16) as God
      destroys both their bodies and souls in hell (Matthew 10:28) and they are
      reduced to ashes (2 Peter 2:6). They will no longer exist as conscious
      people and will be gone forever."

      capable of immortality (after meeting qualifying conditions), or
      alternatively, immortal yet capable of mortality (after meeting
      disqualifying conditions)." "Our own view is that all people will be
      resurrected, but only some will receive a 'resurrection like his,' having
      'died to sin' and been 'crucified with him,' in order that 'we will also
      live' and 'never die again,' for 'death has no dominion' over him, nor
      over those who are 'alive to God in Christ Jesus' (Rom 6:2-11)."

        >Statement on Evangelical Conditionalism</a
      >: "Conditionalism is the view that life is the Creator’s provisional gift
      to all, which will ultimately be granted forever to the saved and revoked
      forever from the unsaved. Evangelical conditionalists believe that the
      saved in Christ will receive glory, honor and immortality, being raised
      with an incorruptible body to inherit eternal life (Romans 2:7). The
      unsaved will be raised in shame and dishonor, to face God and receive the
      just condemnation for their sins. When the penalty is carried out, they
      will be permanently excluded from eternal life by means of a final death,
      implicating the whole person in a destruction of human life and being
      (Matthew 10:28)."
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. Scripture, being the very word of
      God, is both authoritative and accurate in all that it teaches. It is the
      standard of truth over and against all human traditions, philosophies,
      creeds, councils, and authorities. I cite resources at the bottom of each
      section when relevant for further study and support. Not all the authors
      cited are Conditionalists, though the majority are.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain? One
      only needs to consider the time before the Reformation when the majority
      of the visible church was certain that justification was by faith and
      works. It was going back to the Word of God with an open mind to be
      conformed to its message that revealed that doctrinal error. So, it is
      certainly possible for many to be mistaken about what the Bible teaches,
      but what in Scripture would cause someone to question eternal torment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well to start with, the very meaning of the gospel suggests that death,
      not eternal torment, is the price for sin. Everyone is under "the law of
      sin and death" (Rom 8:2), for "the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23). "But
      God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners,
      Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8), so that we have "an atoning sacrifice
      through faith in his blood" (Rom 3:25). He, "who was delivered up for our
      trespasses and raised for our justification" (Rom 4:25), took the penalty
      for our sins, that is death, on the cross for our justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those whose sins are not covered by the cross will be held accountable on
      judgment day. They will have to suffer the consequences of sin with the
      most serious punishment, capital punishment. They will be cast into the
      lake of fire where they will undergo the second death (Rev 20:14). This
      permanent, final punishment, the second death, represents the ultimate
      consequence of sin. It entails eternal and complete destruction from God
      who will annihilate both soul and body in Gehenna (Mat 10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      This punishment is put in contrast to eternal life which is consistently
      presented in the New Testament as the desirable alternative to death,
      destruction, and perishing. The Bible clearly states that the righteous
      will be resurrected and given immortality, but there is no suggestion in
      the Scriptures that the wicked will be granted immortality. They will not
      receive eternal life but perish (Jn 3:16). In contrast to this, the
      historic doctrine of eternal torment holds that unbelievers will also be
      granted eternal, embodied life just like believers, and the price for
      their sins is not death but torment.

      Wenham, embrace conditional immortality and annihilationism 'for the right
      reason—not because it fitted into their comfort zone, though it did, but
      because they thought they found it in the Bible.'"

      firm commitment to the truthfulness and perennial relevance of the Bible,
      and not from a desire to have its message be more palatable to our own
      culture. We are not seeking to construct a more tolerable version of hell,
      as though primarily motivated by an emotional aversion to the idea of
      eternal torment. Neither do we assume, however, that the correct view of
      Hell must be whichever is perceived to be the harshest and most
      intolerable."

      during the intertestamental years and came, by Jesus' time, to be "the
      commonly-accepted Jewish view" (it is said therefore that we ought to read
      Jesus and the NT writers with a presumption that they and their original
      hearers all held to the doctrine of unending conscious torment); (3) that
      the NT language on the subject requires us to conclude that God will make
      the wicked immortal for the purpose of torturing them alive forever

    <h2>Proof Texts</h2>
    <p>
      Consider how each one of these texts states or implies that we must
      believe in Jesus Christ to live eternally:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that
        whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life" (Jn
        3:16).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him who
        sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed
        out of death into life" (Jn 5:24).
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son
        and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at
        the last day" (Jn 6:40).
      </p>
      <p>
        "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son
        of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may
        continue to believe in the name of the Son of God" (1 Jn 5:13)
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus
        Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were
        going to believe in him for eternal life" (1 Tim 1:16).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Other times the Bible speaks of the evidence of faith, the demonstration
      that we are true believers, as the condition for eternal life:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or
        mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive
        one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life" (Mat 19:29).
      </p>
      <p>
        "to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and
        incorruptibility, eternal life" (Rom 2:7).
      </p>
      <p>
        "But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of God,
        you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal life"
        (Rom 6:22).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      And one of my favorite verses. Notice again the condition for receiving
      eternal life and immortality:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst
        again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of
        water springing up to eternal life" (Jn 4:14).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Those who do not have faith in Christ will not receive eternal life but
      perish:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the
        Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him" (Jn 3:36).
      </p>
      <p>
        "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life
        in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom 6:23).

      about unending conscious torture. But it speaks volumes concerning that
      penalty first threatened in the Garden of Eden: Those who sin will "surely
      die" (Gen 3:3; Ezek 18:4)."
    </p>

    <h2>Translation of Hell</h2>
    <p>
      The King James Version translates the words Sheol, Hades, Tartarus, and
      Gehenna as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern English. The
      word hell originally only meant a covered or hidden place (think of the
      word "helmet," a covering for your head); however, it has developed to
      refer to a place of eternal torment. There are still many modern
      translations which translate these words inconsistently, but Gehenna is
      the only one that refers to the final fate of the wicked. It is a real
      valley outside of Jerusalem with an Old Testament background that needs to
      be taken into account.

      Jesus put it in Matthew 10:28, where God destroys 'both body and soul.' We
      don’t believe in hell as a place of eternal torment because that’s not

      is the equivalent of the Greek Haides, by which word it is translated in
      Septuagint... The believer's hope for the future, so far as this had
      place, was not prolonged existence in Sheol, but deliverance from it and
      restoration to new life in God's presence (Job 14:13-15; Job 19:25-27
      Psalm 16:10, 11; Psalm 17:15; Psalm 49:15; Psalm 73:24-26)."

      anticipated return from exile, their Messiah would trample Sheol
      underfoot, and they would be raised from the dead by God’s Spirit.... The
      gates of Sheol will not prevail against Christ’s church because Jesus has
      already broken down its doors. All those united to Christ by faith and
      through the power of his Holy Spirit are no longer prisoners of death."

      By its usage we see that Sheol was considered the place or state of all
      the dead -- whether they were good or bad. When used figuratively it could

      spoke of 'dark Tartarus...the deepest pit' (Iliad, 8.13). Here [2 Peter
      2:4], it is used of the abode of evil angels prior to their banishment to
      Gehenna, their ultimate destiny (cf. Mt. 25:41)."
    </p>

    <h2>Gehenna</h2>
    <p>
      Gehenna, the shortened name for the valley of Hinnom, became notorious
      during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh as the location where
      children were sacrificed by fire to the god Molech (2 Chron 28:3; 33:6).
      The valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be called a
      place of slaughter where it was prophesied to be filled with the corpses
      of those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became synonymous
      with divine punishment, where the dead bodies of the slain were left
      unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting a vivid picture of
      desolation and wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just bodily destruction, but
      the culmination of divine judgment where the opportunity for salvation is
      irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete destruction of soul
      and body by God. Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically to illustrate the
      final death of the wicked (Mat 5:22, 29-30, 18:9). This imagery resonates
      with Isaiah 66:24, a verse Jesus quotes when speaking of Gehenna,
      reinforcing the notion of Gehenna as a place of total annihilation. This
      is consistent with Paul who speaks of the ultimate fate of the wicked in
      terms of destruction (Phil 1:28; 3:18-19; Rom 9:22-24; 2 Thes 1:8-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      A common myth is that the Valley of Hinnom was a garbage dump that was
      always burning with fire, and therefore provided good imagery for eternal
      torment. However, this is a baseless claim first made by Rabbi David Kimhi
      around A.D. 1200. Although the garbage dump theory is commonly stated in
      study Bibles and commentaries to support the doctrine of eternal torment,
      there is no archeological or literary evidence to back it up. The reality
      is that the Old Testament provides the background for Gehenna as a place
      of slaughter, death, and destruction, a stark contrast to the idea of
      people being tormented forever and never dying.

    <h2>Penalty</h2>
    <p>
      Penalty is that pain or loss which is directly or indirectly inflicted by
      the Lawgiver, in vindication of his justice outraged by the violation of
      law.
    </p>
    <p>In this definition it is implied that:</p>
    <p>
      1. The natural consequences of transgression, although they constitute a
      part of the penalty of sin, do not exhaust that penalty. In all penalty
      there is a personal element, the holy wrath of the Lawgiver, which natural
      consequences but partially express.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The object of penalty is not the reformation of the offender or the
      ensuring of social or governmental safety. These ends may be incidentally
      secured through its infliction, but the great end of penalty is the
      vindication of the character of the Lawgiver. Penalty is essentially a
      necessary reaction of the divine holiness against sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sin is the negation of the law. Penalty is the negation of that negation,
      that is, the reestablishment of the law. Sin is a thrust of the sinner
      against the law, and penalty is the adverse thrust of that law against
      sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ submitted to physical death as the penalty for sin, and by his
      resurrection from the grave gave proof that the penalty of sin was
      exhausted and that humanity in him was justified. Sin and its effects
      still remain for now. However, the believers hope is in resurrection unto
      eternal life with Christ, while the end for unbelief is eternal death.
      These two outcomes are seen in the twofold nature of death in Scripture:
    </p>
    <p>
      The first death is the loss of bodily life including all those temporal
      evils and sufferings accompanying it. Physical death is a direct
      consequence of sin and a curse on humanity. The first death is an
      expression of the nature of God and his holy wrath against sin, but it is
      not the full expression of God's justice against sin. The souls of all men
      survive the first death to be raised and judged on the last day. The
      bodily resurrection of those in Christ is the defeat and reversal of the
      first death, while the resurrection of those in Adam is for the execution
      of justice which consists of the second death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second death is the destruction of soul and body from God including
      all the shame and torment accompanying it. Unbelievers will be rasied on
      the last day to give account for deeds done in this life to the Son who
      will execute judgment. The second death is the penalty they will face for
      their sins. It is nothing less than eternal death which encompasses the
      loss of the whole person forever. It is an eternal punishment from which
      there is neither return nor end. After the final judgment, justice will
      have been accomplished and all those who suffered in this life for God's
      sake will be vindicated.

    <h2>Fallacies</h2>
    <p>
      Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman. Both sides
      affirm eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature of that
      punishment. Conditionalists do not argue that the punishment for sin is
      ceasing to exist. The punishment is death (deprivation of life). For the
      damned, this punishment is eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annihilationists redefine the word eternal: This misunderstands the
      position. Annihilationism is the view that the punishment for sin is
      death, though it does affirm that there is suffering leading up to and
      accompanying that death. Both positions affirm eternal punishment. It is
      not the view that sinners receive the punishment of torment for a long
      time to pay the price of their sins before God ends their lives, and it
      does not teach that God instantly annihilates sinners so that they face no
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This view must be wrong because Jehovah's Witnesses believe it: This isn't
      even the genetic fallacy. Annihilationism has strong support in the early
      church until the time of Augustine and is becoming more common among
      conservative, Bible-believing Christians now. This is the guilt by
      association fallacy. Just because this position is held by a heretical
      group, doesn't mean that it is wrong or that others hold the position for
      the same reasons. The arguments given here are exegetical and based on
      accepted hermeneutical principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists deny degrees of punishment: It is argued that
      Conditionalism must deny degrees of punishment since the wicked will all
      face the same fate of death in the end. This does not follow though. If
      you want to understand degrees of capital punishment, consider the
      differences between death by lethal injection, firing squad, burning at
      the stake, and crucifixion. In contrast, the traditional view is that one
      sin and a lifetime of sin both merit everlasting torment. Both views give
      an account for degrees of punishment, though the latter appears to give a
      much worse account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
      character of love and justice: This is a red herring. The focus should
      remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room to discuss
      the justness of each view, but one's intuition about justice should not be
      treated as the primary argument or motivation for their view. Moreover,
      death, not eternal torment, is consistently said to be the price of sin,
      so it is not hard to understand the belief that capital punishment aligns
      with God's justice. Traditionalists also have explanations for why God
      would be just to inflict eternal torment. Ultimately, we must rely on the
      Bible more than intuition or emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea of
      people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just theological
      liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people begin with these
      kinds of accusations. The goal is not to psychoanalyze the other side but
      to examine arguments about the biblical view of hell. It may in fact be
      traditionalists that are not taking the biblical language serious enough
      through constant allegorizing of language about life and death, perishing,
      destruction, fire, Gehenna, extinction, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as metaphors
      for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets these
      descriptions non-literally or metaphorically is not only false, it is used
      rhetorically to discount consideration of the view. Destruction and
      annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on fire are consumed
      and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions to mean eternal
      conscious torment is clearly the metaphorical interpretation of these
      passages.

      instead of speaking in terms of everlasting suffering, the Bible
      predominantly describes the fate of the lost in terms of destruction...
      John Stott has commented that 'it would seem strange, therefore, if people
      who are said to suffer destruction are in fact not destroyed.' He concurs
      with his partner in dialogue David Edwards (while they disagree on many
      other things) that it is 'difficult to imagine a perpetually inconclusive
      process of perishing.'"

    <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
      created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
      existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live on
      forever. God "is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna." (Mat.
      10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone will
      experience eternal life, either in heaven or hell, is an assumption that
      must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is almost the only text used
      to argue that all people will be raised with immortality and
      incorruptibility; however, in context, this chapter is only about those in
      Christ being raised and says nothing of unbelievers. Verses like John 3:16
      indicate the opposite, that unbelievers are destined to perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Horton, A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way, (Zondervan:
      Grand Rapids, 2011), 908: "However, in Scripture there is no assumption
      that the soul is immortal. Rather, like the body, it is a created
      substance with a beginning and an end. Immortality was the goal held out
      to Adam and Eve in the Tree of Life, and not merely for the soul but for
      the whole person. It is this immortality that was forfeited by Adam but
      has been promised to those who trust in Jesus Christ."

        >The Neglected Doctrines of Resurrection and Bodily Transformation</a
      >, 2017: "This, in a nutshell, is conditional immortality, in which
      salvation is understood to be rescue from the mortal condition that
      results from sin... It explains why Christ’s resurrection is so unique and
      profound, and how if we are to receive eternal life and immortality, it is
      necessary for us to participate in 'a resurrection like his' (Rom 6:5). To
      a dying world, the fact that Jesus died and conquered death for us is very
      good news indeed."

    <h2>John M. Frame</h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Theology-Introduction-Christian-Belief/dp/1596382171"
        target="_blank"
        >Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</a
      >
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2013). In response to the chapter
      called "Eternal Punishment of Unbelievers (Hell)," pgs. 1081-1083:
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Frame admits that he is reluctant to write about the topic of hell,
      unpleasant as it is, he states, "I must teach only what the Bible
      teaches." This is certainly to be commended; however, the question still
      remains, what does the Bible teach about hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      I certainly agree with Frame that all sinners are under the just
      condemnation of a holy God and in need of a savior. We are saved by faith
      in the Son of God who died on the cross for us. His death provides
      atonement for our sins, but the wrath of God remains on those who don't
      believe in the Son. Frame cites Exodus 15:6-7 to explain the wrath of God,
      but it also provides important background information about the consuming
      fire of God:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh,
        dashes the enemy in pieces. In the greatness of your excellency, you
        overthrow those who rise up against you. You send out your wrath. It
        consumes them as stubble."
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Frame states that the "OT descriptions of God's wrath mainly concern what
      happens in this life." The Old Testament speaks of God's enemies being
      slain, consumed by fire, and put to an end. He is beginning to try to
      create a contrast between Old and New Testament language of destruction
      because he believes that the New Testament teaches eternal conscious
      torment. However, the New Testament uses Old Testament language to
      describe eschatological judgment. If the Old Testament descriptions are of
      annihilation, it provides strong support for conditionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then makes the argument that punishment in this life could never
      satisfy God's law and cites Hebrews 10:26-27:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
        truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
        expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the
        adversaries."
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      This sounds awfully familiar to the outcome of God's enemies in the Old
      Testament. The traditional view does not teach that God's enemies will be
      consumed and devoured. Instead, it teaches that they will continue burning
      alive forever. Thus far, no support for the traditional view can be found
      while much of the language cited provides support for conditionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists agree with Frame that the final "punishment is
      everlasting," but Romans 6:23 explains what the punishment for sin is:
      "the wages of sin is death." Frame cites Matthew 25:46 to support the
      eternal aspect of the final judgment:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
        eternal life."

      Notice that Jesus contrasts eternal punishment with eternal life. The
      final punishment doesn't include eternal life. Traditionalists argue that
      the wicked will be made immortal and granted eternal life to suffer in
      hell forever. Conditionalists, on the other hand, argue that the wicked
      will not receive eternal life but perish eternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Frame reveals the real impetus behind his belief in eternal
      conscious torment: Revelation 14:11. And like most traditionalist
      treatments on hell, there is no consideration given to the context, genre,
      or background of the verse. It's just cited as if it came out of a
      textbook, rather than an apocalyptic book full of Old Testament allusions
      and symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frame's only response to annihilationism is that "Scripture suggests the
      opposite, that not only does the fire continue forever, but the torment of
      the wicked continues forever as well (Rev. 14:11; 20:10)." This is not a
      substantial explanation. If we remember that John's vision is of a
      representation of the final judgment (it's symbolic), then we see that
      Frame hasn't even started to give a biblical argument for eternal
      conscious torment because he hasn't tried to interpret any of the symbols.
      Both passages are describing the final judgment. John interprets the lake
      of fire in Revelation 20:10 in clear language two times. The lake of fire
      is the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8). It means dying a second time, both
      body and soul (Mat 10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      He provides several references in parentheses for support which, when
      understood in context, provide vivid pictures of annihilation. Mark 9:43
      and 48 contain a quote to Isaiah 66:24, a passage indicating that the
      fires will be inextinguishable, thus burning up the dead bodies
      completely. Luke 16:22-24 and 28 are not even about hell, but about Hades,
      the intermediate state, demonstrating the sloppiness of exegesis needed to
      provide support for the traditional view. Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 both
      indicate that smoke rises forever. Likewise, the smoke rises forever from
      Edom which was destroyed by unquenchable fire (Isa 34:8-10). The
      everlasting smoke symbolizes the remembrance of a judgment which results
      in complete destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other verses in Scripture are very clear on this issue too. Paul teaches
      that sin leads to death and destruction. The language of eschatological
      perishing and dying is used all over the New Testament. The Old Testament
      is very clear about the fate of the wicked too. All of that clear teaching
      can't be reinterpreted based upon the non-exegesis of Revelation.
      Unfortunately, that's what most defenses of the traditional view amount
      to.

        >A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith: 2nd Edition</a
      >, 2020. In response to the chapter called "Eternal Punishment Construed
      as Annihilation," pgs. 1068-1081:
    </p>
    <p>
      Reymond says in the beginning of this section that John gives us a
      "graphic representation of hell," but just after that, he quotes
      Revelation 14:9-11 and states that "<em>eternal conscious torment</em>
      is [here] said to be the punishment of those who have the mark of the
      beast." These two statements contradict. John is not giving
      straightforward, didactic teaching about hell. He's recording a pictorial
      representation of the final judgment that he sees in a vision, not a
      vision of hell itself. The Old Testament background, parallel judgment
      passages, and John's own interpretation of the symbols are keys to
      understanding what that imagery represents. Reymond completely disregards
      the context and takes his own interpretation for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if we take the passage at face value without interpreting what each
      symbol represents, Reymond's interpretation of eternal conscious torment
      still does not follow. John only states that these people will be
      tormented in fire, won't have any rest for a time, and that the smoke
      rising from this judgment will last forever. Traditionalist scholar G. K.
      Beale agrees that an annihilationist reading is possible because "Rev
      14:10-11 could indicate a great judgment that will be remembered forever,
      not one that leads to eternal suffering" (<a
        href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/762/mode/1up"
        target="_blank"
        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, 762). Furthermore, there are conditionalists that do believe that
      eternal conscious torment is being depicted here that symbolizes
      annihilation. Either way, Reymond has decided that eternal conscious
      torment is the correct view ahead of time and skips the necessary
      exegesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demonstrates a common interpretive problem when it comes to this
      issue. Revelation may be the hardest book to interpret in the New
      Testament. It is full of symbolism and Old Testament allusions which are
      not readily understood by people in a context removed from the original
      audience. Thus, taking a surface level reading of Revelation 14:9-11 or
      20:10, concluding that it teaches eternal conscious torment, and then
      reading that view back into every other passage about hell is completely
      backwards and irresponsible hermeneutically.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that short argument from Revelation, Reymond finishes his very first
      paragraph by concluding that "it is clear that the divine judgment
      awaiting evil-doers is certain, just, and eternal." Every conditionalist
      would agree wholeheartedly with this conclusion, except that Reymond
      clearly means eternal torment is certain. Not only is this misrepresenting
      conditionalism as if it denies eternal punishment before he has even
      explained the position, but it's also presenting that poor exegesis of
      Revelation as if it's decisive. Reymond has already precluded the
      possibility of conditionalism with absolutely no biblical support offered.
      The eisegesis that follows was inevitable from his starting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reymond addresses very few Old Testament passages because of his
      presupposition of eternal conscious torment. The Old Testament has much to
      say about the final death and destruction of the wicked, and God putting a
      final end to evil. However, the few texts cited still provide a vivid
      picture of annihilation: the fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the
      destruction of Sihon killing every man, woman, and child, the principle of
      herem ("devotion") to the Lord for complete destruction, the fact that
      every evil deed will be judged, and the prophecy that the redeemed will go
      out in the new heavens and new earth to look on the dead bodies of those
      who rebelled against God which are being eaten by worms and burned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      That last image comes from Isaiah 66:22-24. The only comment on this
      passage is a quote from a commentary. It affirms that this passage is
      indeed about the final state but explains away the obvious conditionalist
      implications by calling it a "monstrous and inconceivable" picture.
      Actually, it's very clear. The picture is of dead bodies that were slain,
      burned up, consumed, and looked on with contempt. It then cites Mark 9:48
      as support that this is a picture of eternal torment, but that argument is
      completely circular. Jesus quotes from this passage in Mark 9:48, not to
      reinterpret it to mean the exact opposite of what it means in context, but
      because this passage is an accurate description of Gehenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament section is hurt by the bad exegesis of the Old
      Testament. Jesus uses the phrase "unquenchable fire" because the fire
      can't be put out so that it completely consumes. Reymond acknowledges that
      the garbage dump theory of Gehenna comes "from late Jewish tradition
      (David Qimchi, c. A.D. 1200)" and has no support, but he nevertheless
      wrongly treats that as the primary background over and against the Old
      Testament. Even if we accepted the garbage dump theory, the garbage would
      be burned up anyway. It doesn't actually help his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeping primarily indicates sadness. Gnashing teeth primarily indicates
      anger. Weeping and gnashing are not said to last eternally, and are
      accurate descriptions of people on death row or being burned alive. He
      says that a "more bearable" (Mat 10:15) judgment day on an annihilationist
      view is difficult to comprehend because everyone ends up dead. Being
      instantly incinerated versus being burned alive for hours clearly
      represent two different degrees of capital punishment. On the contrary, it
      is very hard to comprehend how the traditional view accounts for different
      degrees of punishment when one sin merits the same punishment as a billion
      sins, eternal suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the intermediate state consists of torment, it does not follow
      that the eternal state consists of eternal torment. Just because the
      demons expect torment in the future (Mat 8:29), doesn't mean that they
      expect eternal torment (and so what if they did?). Tartarus in 2 Peter 2:4
      does not refer to hell. It is the holding place for angels until the
      judgment. That is just another factual error from Reymond.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for some reason, even though Reymond and Vos think the language of 2
      Thessalonians 1:9 is of annihilation, Vos thinks "that 'annihilation' is
      an extremely abstract idea, too philosophical, in fact." It's not that
      complicated. It just means their final death. He also argues that Paul
      couldn't have been thinking of annihilation because Jesus taught eternal
      torment in the gospels. This shows the potential danger of arguing based
      on the analogy of scripture when you fail to interpret other passages
      properly. It's better to carefully exegete the text before attempting to
      apply systematic theology to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This entire chapter illustrates how a bad starting point, misinterpreting
      a passage in Revelation, led to systematic misinterpretation of other
      passages about the final fate of the wicked. It also illustrates that we
      can't be dogmatic about tradition. We must test all things by the Word of
      God. Reymond concludes the New Testament section without an in depth
      treatment of Revelation, but he assures us of his interpretation about the
      fires of Revelation by stating that "we should understand the realities
      these biblical passages seek to represent to be
      <em>more</em>—not less—horrible than their word depictions." However,
      having a more intolerable, dreadful, and harsh view of hell does not make
      it correct or more convincing.

    <h2>Robert A. Morey</h2>

      Annihilationism, pgs. 199-220:
    </p>

    <p>
      Morey's arguments are much better suited to argue against Froom and
      Seventh-Day Adventists. Unfortunately, he doesn't address the kind of
      exegetical and theological points evangelical conditionalists use to
      support conditional immortality.
    </p>

    <p>A Brief History</p>
    <p>
      Morey begins by attempting to give a brief history of conditional
      immortality. He claims that annihilationism "was first advanced by
      Arnobius" in the fourth century whom he calls a "Christian" in quotes. The
      <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01746c.htm" target="_blank"
        >Catholic Encyclopedia</a
      >
      notes:
    </p>
    <section>
      "Arnobius is more earnest in his defence of Christianity than correct in
      his tenets," but "Arnobius is a vigorous apologist for the Christian
      Faith, defends and expounds its noble monotheism (<em
        >deus princeps, deus summus</em
      >), the Divinity of Christ and of the Christian religion, proved by its
      rapid diffusion, its incredible influence over uncivilized peoples, and
      its agreement with the views of the best philosophers."
    </section>
    <p>
      It would be convenient for Morey if Arnobius really were the first
      proponent of conditionalism several hundred years after the New Testament
      but that simply isn't true. Arnobius was following in a tradition of
      conditionalists. It appears that all of the Apostolic Fathers and many
      early Christians were conditionalists, but one example suffices to refute
      the claim that Arnobius is the first. That Irenaeus (c. A.D. 120-200) is a
      conditionalist is very clear in multiple places and is widely recognized
      by traditionalist scholars. Irenaeus in
      <a
        href="https://archive.org/details/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete/page/n137/mode/1up"
        target="_blank"
        >Against Heresies</a
      >
      (2.34.3) writes:
    </p>
    <section>
      "He asked life of You, and You gave him length of days for ever and ever;
      indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance for ever
      and ever on those who are saved... If you have not been faithful in that
      which is little, who will give you that which is great? indicating that
      those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves ungrateful
      to Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him length of days
      for ever and ever."
    </section>
    <p>
      Morey's historical argument thus falls flat. It was not a later,
      biblically illiterate Christian who first taught conditionalism as Morey
      portrays it, but a stream of Christians from the earliest times after the
      New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey repeats the often made claim that the
      <a
        href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.x.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Second Council of Constantinople</a
      >
      (A.D. 553) condemned conditionalism as heresy. He provides no quote but is
      most likely refering to anathematism IX which says, "If anyone says or
      thinks that the punishment of demons and of impious men is only temporary,
      and will one day have an end, and that a restoration will take place of
      demons and of impious men, let him be anathema." However, this is a
      condemnation against Origen's universalism, and says nothing contrary to
      conditionalism. On the annihilation view, the punishment is eternal and no
      restoration will ever take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agree with Morey that the traditional view of hell is widespread after
      Augustine, but as traditionalist scholar Graham Keith notes, "a century or
      so after Constantine [the 5th century] we have a surprising amount of
      evidence indicating widespread denial of eternal [conscious] punishment
      within the church" (<a
        href="https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1999-3_217.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >Patristic Views on Hell―Part 1</a
      >). Even at so late a date, ECT was still widely denied in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also agree with Morey that a theologian believing in soul sleep does not
      imply that they believe in annihilationism. He claims that many
      annihilationists argue that soul sleep implies annihilationism citing
      Froom as an example, but I've never heard that claim before.
      Annihilationism is about the final state and doesn't commit one to soul
      sleep which is about the intermediate state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although conditionalism is held by several cult groups today, Seventh-Day
      Adventists are an example of a Christian denomination that holds to
      conditionalism. Morey claims that the publishing of
      <em>The Fire That Consumes</em> by Edward Fudge was done with the hope to
      "introduce Adventist theology into evangelical circles" almost
      conspiratorially. But the question of conditional immortality is quite
      apart from other Seventh-Day Adventist doctrines. Even if that was the
      intention, conditionalism is held by many evangelicals across different
      denominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ends the first section by claiming that annihilationism is on the rise
      because of liberalism and "is regrettably the result of a weak view of
      Scripture which has been developing in certain evangelical circles over
      the last 25 years." But that is incredibly uncharitable to those who are
      committed to biblical innerancy and believe the Bible teaches conditional
      immortality. It also poisons the well by painting conditionalism as the
      liberal view before addressing even a single biblical text. A doctrine
      being taught widely in the church makes it traditional, not biblical! It
      has to come from the Bible to properly be described as biblical.
    </p>

    <p>A Theological Analysis</p>
    <p>
      For some strange reason, Morey equates conditional immortality with
      materialism. He claims that "both deny that man has an immaterial soul and
      that man’s soul or spirit survives the death of the body," but this is
      certainly false. As far as the first claim, some conditionalists are
      anthropological physicalists while others are dualists. Christian
      physicalism is not materialism because it affirms the existence of God and
      other spiritual realities. It just denies that man's soul is an immaterial
      substance. For the second claim, while evangelical conditionalism teaches
      that God will "destroy both soul and body in Gehenna" (Mat 10:28), it
      affirms that everyone's soul survives death until the general resurrection
      and final judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey continues to present annihilationism as a cultic view stating that
      "we must point out that it is generally in connection with cultic or
      neo-cultic organizations that this belief is found." If conditionalism is
      such a plainly unbiblical belief, we wouldn't need all the inaccurate
      historical and theological priming against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contra Froom's introduction, conditionalism is attested early, is not a
      form of materialism, was not condemed as heretical by the Second Council
      of Constantinople, is not an inherently cultic or liberal belief, has no
      inherent connection to other Seventh-Day Adventist beliefs, and has strong
      biblical arguments for it that need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey raises and responds to twelve conditionalist arguments in the next
      section which primarily come from Froom's
      <em>The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers</em> (1965). I have not read
      that work, but I am not impressed by it based on Morey's relaying. Edward
      Fudge's <em>The Fire that Consumes</em> (1982) is barely addressed, but I
      think it is a much stronger presentation of conditionalism.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 1</p>
    <p>
      Morey responds to the claim that conditionalist arguments have been
      ignored and adds the gripe that the label "traditionalism" implies that
      ECT is only held because of tradition and not the Bible. While not an
      argument for conditionalism, I definitely agree that conditionalist
      arguments have not been given substantial responses and that the
      traditional view is predominantly held because of tradition. Morey
      mentions "Bartlett, Boettner, Grant, A. Hodge, Hovey, Landis, Stuart,
      Martin, etc." as writers who have responded to conditionalism. I have not
      read all of them, but older writers such as Herman Bavinck are primarily
      responding to liberal and emotional arguments. Many modern traditionalists
      such as Morey or Robert L. Reymond continue to argue against many of the
      same bad arguments instead of addressing robust evangelical proponents of
      conditionalism such as Edward Fudge. Mischaracterizations and sloppiness
      abound in traditionalist works.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while responses do exist, there are few serious responses. There are
      even prominent traditionalists agree with that assessment. James White for
      example agrees that most proponents of ECT are following it because of
      tradition and not because of any firm biblical understanding, though he
      does believe the Bible teaches it (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Kclj_vN48"
        target="_blank"
        >Is the Punishment of Hell Temporary or Eternal?</a
      >).
    </p>

    <p>Arguments 2, 3, and 12</p>
    <p>
      These are against soul sleep. I don't believe in soul sleep so I agree
      with Morey here, but it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. Morey does have
      a common modern misunderstanding about the final state though. Unbelievers
      do not go straight to hell when they die. They go to hades (the grave).
      This is known as the intermediate state. It is only after the general
      resurrection of all that they face the final judgment and are sent to
      Gehenna. This again has support from traditionalists. James White says,
      "It seems rather obvious to me that hell is the final state. You go to
      Hades, and then death and Hades are cast into the Lake of Fire, the Book
      of Revelation, at the end" (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVqPf5pXkJM"
        target="_blank"
        >Francis' Empty Hell, Brandan's Empty Bible</a
      >, 6:48).
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey assumes (as does Froom it seems) that the intermediate state must be
      exactly like the eternal state, but that is a faulty assumption. The
      intermediate state is like a holding cell until the resurrection,
      judgment, and final damnation to Gehenna. There is no reason to conflate
      the two when the Bible does not. The intermediate state could consist of
      the worst torment imaginable, but that would not change the fact that the
      wicked will face the second death on judgment day.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 4</p>
    <p>
      The conditionalist argument given is that Sheol and Hades both mean grave,
      so there is no intermediate state but instead immediate death. This is a
      really bad argument. Morey rightly rejects it, but for the wrong reason.
      Hades really is the grave contrary to what Morey says, but at the end of
      the age, Hades will give up the dead so that they can be judged: "Death
      and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one
      according to his works" (Rev 20:13).
    </p>

    <p>Argument 5</p>
    <p>
      The most common terms for the fate of the wicked are "destroyed,"
      "consumed", "perish," etc., which must "mean that they pass into
      nonexistence." Annihilation does not mean nonexistent, but killed,
      destroyed, unalived. The given answer to this argument is that
      <em>apollumi</em>
      doesn't actually mean destroyed, but "ruin, loss... of well-being." There
      is a good reason Bible translations don't translate it that way. When
      people are "apollumi-ed," they are killed, destroyed, and lose their life.
      When objects are "apollumi-ed," they are ruined or lost. Check out Mark
      Corbett's video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Lcq51oHRQ" target="_blank"
        >Apollumi: The Word that Tells Us What Happens to People in Hell
        (Annihilation or Eternal Torment?)</a
      >
      to see every use of the word apollumi in the New Testament and uses
      outside the New Testament.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 6</p>
    <p>
      Eternal life means living forever. Only the righteous get eternal life.
      Therefore, only the righteous will live forever. This is a super simple
      and effective argument. His response is that eternal life actually means
      "a quality of divine life." It's obvious that he isn't taking the language
      in a natural way. Of course eternal life has a positive quality or
      connotation to it, but the phrase eternal life does mean living forever.
      Just as the Israelites looked to the raised serpent to save their lives
      temporarily (Jn 3:14-15), we look to Jesus to save our lives eternally (Jn
      3:16). This isn't complicated or cryptic language.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 7</p>
    <p>
      1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God has immortality, so man is not immortal.
      I agree with Morey's response that this means that only God has absolute
      immortality. However, I disagree that the unrighteous will be granted
      immortality. Post-fall humans are mortal, and eternal life and immortality
      are a gift for the righteous at the resurrection (1 Cor 15). The burden of
      proof is on Morey to show that the unrighteous will be granted eternal
      life and immortality too.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 8</p>
    <p>
      He presents the argument that Gehenna is a garbage dump whose fire and
      worms will go out after the trash is consumed. However, the first claim
      that Gehenna was a garbage dump comes from Rabbi David Kimhi around A.D.
      1200. This mistake doesn't help his case though. The context for Gehenna
      in Jeremiah 7 indicates that the fire and worms will burn up and consume
      <em>dead bodies</em>. Gehenna is prophesied to be called the Valley of
      Slaughter because God is going to slay His enemies there. But even if a
      dump were the background, of course the garbage would be burned up and the
      garbage would still represent corpses which couldn't feel torment
      regardless.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 9</p>
    <p>
      I don't argue that olam, aion, and aionios mean something other than
      eternal, but eternal undeniably can refer to something either eternal in
      process or eternal in result when refering to certain nouns. Examples:
      Eternal salvation means something is eternally saved. If something is
      eternally saved, it is either being saved forever or is forever saved.
      Eternal destruction means something is eternally destroyed. If something
      is eternally destroyed, it is either being destroyed forever or is forever
      destroyed. Eternal judgment means something is eternally judged. If
      something is eternally judged, it is either being judged forever or
      forever judged. If something is eternally punished, it is either being
      punished forever or forever punished. This is not controversial and can be
      found in standard Greek lexicons and confirmed by linguistics.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 10</p>
    <p>
      It is very obvious from the biblical account that the soul is not
      preexistent. It is clear but less obvious that the soul is not necessarily
      immortal. The reason it is valid to claim that the traditional view is
      influened by Plato's philosophy is that the very first proponents of ECT,
      Tertullian and Athenagoras of Athens, both cite Plato extensively in the
      context of their belief in the intrinsic immortality of the soul, an idea
      central to Plato's philosophy and absent from the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tertullian,
      <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm" target="_blank"
        >A Treatise on the Soul</a
      >: "he [Socrates], in the face of death itself, asserts the immortality of
      the soul by a strong assumption" (1), an account which comes from Plato.
      Side note, "the operation of death is plain and obvious: it is the
      separation of body and soul" (51). Many conditionalists agree with this
      statement; however, there is a difference between the operation or
      technical details of death, separation of body and soul, and the
      definition of death, the loss of bodily life, which is often missed by
      modern traditionalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athenagoras of Athens,
      <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm" target="_blank"
        >A Plea for the Christians</a
      >: He expounds much on the philosophers including "Plato and Aristotle —
      not that I am about to go through all that the philosophers have said
      about God..." (6). He holds that "God has not made us as sheep or beasts
      of burden, a mere by-work, and that we should perish [apollumi] and be
      annihilated [aphanizo]" (31), explicitly opposed to John 3:16, Acts
      13:40-41, 2 Peter 2:12-13 and many other texts. About the resurrection he
      writes, "for nothing hinders, according to Pythagoras and Plato, that when
      the dissolution of bodies takes place, they should, from the very same
      elements of which they were constructed at first, be constructed again"
      (36). The influence of Plato is very clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey admits that "the orthodox have always viewed life in this world or
      in the next as a gift of God," which logically entails that the
      traditional view holds that God grants the gift of immortality to sinners
      at the final judgment. A radical claim that is not supported in this
      section.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 11</p>
    <p>
      The conditionalist argument given is that all Jewish and early patristic
      writings support conditionalism. I agree that this claim is overstated.
      While the vast majority of early Jewish writings support conditionalism,
      ECT is occasionally found in some later Jewish writings. And while all the
      Apostolic Fathers appear to support conditionalism, ECT would enter the
      church a little over a century later from theologians in the late second
      century like Athenagoras of Athens (A.D. 133-190) and Tertullian (A.D.
      160-240).
    </p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      He believes to "have covered all the arguments for conditionalism and
      annihilationism... to be found in the literature on this subject." One of
      the most obvious arguments is that Christ died for sins. He was our
      substitute on the cross bearing the punishment we deserve. The punishment
      Christ suffered was a brutal, painful death. Therefore, the punishment for
      those not saved by Christ is a brutal, painful death: "For the wages of
      sin is death" (Rom 6:23). It is clear from this simple argument that Morey
      has not comprehensively responded to conditionalist arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though there were problems with Morey's responses, a big issue was that
      the arguments for conditionalism were just bad. They barely addressed
      Scripture at all. Responding to Edward Fudge would have been much more
      fruitful and exegetically focused. Also understanding that annihilationism
      is <em>only</em> about the final fate of the wicked would help further the
      discussion. Conditionalists hold different views on the anthropology of
      man, the intermediate state and other issues, but these are distinct from
      the doctrine of hell.

    <p>
      Carson focuses on conservative annihilationists, which I appreciate.
      However, he still spends a lot of space addressing philosophical and
      emotional arguments rather than exegetical ones which is unfortunate. I
      won't be addressing those as much. The biblical case is decisive and
      authoritative in a way that philosophy, history and emotion are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson provides three reasons for why he is addressing annihilationism.
      The first is that evangelicalism is expanding to allow conditionalism to
      be seen as a valid viewpoint as the number of its evangelical adherents is
      rapidly increasing. This could be seen as proof that liberalism is on the
      rise, but it could also indicate that there's a strong biblical case that
      hasn't been sufficiently answered. The second is the fact that some
      conditionalists really are theological liberals who primarily appeal to
      emotion and God's love instead of addressing the Bible. I strongly reject
      that along with Carson. The third is that there is a movement of
      conservatives for whom this issue is entirely hermeneutical, but who "are
      proving unwilling to be corrected by more careful exegesis." We will
      evaluate that claim in the following analysis.
    </p>
    <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Carson does a good job of summarizing the conditionalist position. He
      notes that there are different views of anthropology, the intermediate
      state, and other doctrines among conditionalists, but the common beliefs
      that "the punishment is unending," the wicked "are finally destroyed," and
      the rejection of the traditional view of eternal conscious torment (ECT).
      He distinguishes between conditional immortality and annihilationism
      stating that their anthropology is different; however, most people use
      these terms interchangeably. Conditional immortality states that there is
      a condition that's required for eternal life, faith in Christ, while
      annihilationism describes the fate of those who don't meet that condition.
      It's a difference in emphasis rather than being two separate positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He writes that annihilationists "hold that there is finally a cessation of
      existence," but existence is not the right category. The term annihilation
      is meant to indicate death, destruction of soul and body, and the loss of
      life. This is an important and common misconception which will be
      addressed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson gives a bibliography for treatments on hell, both historical and
      modern. He doesn't discuss them here, though he fears "these are largely
      unread by those who espouse annihilationism." However, I’ve read a lot of
      materials from traditionalists at this point and grew up only knowing
      about the traditional view of hell. It is much more often the case that
      traditionalists don’t understand conditional immortality and have studied
      the doctrine of hell very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson states that in this chapter he’s avoiding "idiosyncratic
      interpretations" in his treatment of conditionalism, not addressing the
      fate of people who don't hear the gospel, and not discussing side
      questions that may arise. While Carson doesn’t provide idiosyncratic
      interpretations, he does use idiosyncratic methods to come to those
      interpretations. In the following analysis, I seek to demonstrate that
      conditional immortality is simply the result of consistent hermeneutical
      principles applied to scriptural passages about the final fate of the
      wicked.
    </p>
    <h2>B. The Case for Conditional Immortality</h2>
    <p>
      He briefly lays out seven arguments used to defend conditional immortality
      in this section:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Passages that say the wicked will be destroyed "suggests total
      destruction, i.e., cessation of existence." Again, many traditionalists
      insist on characterizing annihilationists as saying that the wicked will
      "cease to exist," but this is simply not accurate. When a person dies,
      their body does not cease to exist. It's just dead. Likewise, the soul of
      a person may still exist after it is destroyed. The point is that the body
      and soul of the wicked will be killed and destroyed, i.e., their life will
      be totally ended. Mark Corbett's video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Lcq51oHRQ" target="_blank"
        >Apollumi: The Word that Tells Us What Happens to People in Hell
        (Annihilation or Eternal Torment?)</a
      >
      thoroughly demonstrates that apollumi, the Greek word translated
      destruction, does indeed mean killing or slaying when referring to the
      fate of the unrighteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An unquenchable fire destroys that which it burns. Unquenchable means
      inextinguishable, which emphasizes the certainty of its devouring and
      consuming (see Mat 3:12 // Isa 66:24). The reason it destroys is precisely
      because it will not be put out or stopped. All of the metaphors and direct
      language that explain the unquenchable fire such as chaff, trees, thorns,
      thistles, destruction, burn up, and consume demonstrate that Jesus is
      talking about a consuming fire rather than torment. Carson does a good
      explaining this argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. I agree with Carson that the words translated eternal and forever in
      Matthew 25:46 and Revelation 14:11 refer to an endless amount of time, so
      this point stands. Most conditionalists would agree with this as well. It
      is typically universalists that argue against that.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. In Matthew 25:46, eternal is used to describe life and punishment. This
      is referring to the everlasting life believers, and the final, everlasting
      death of the wicked. Everlasting death is properly called an eternal
      punishment. There is no justification for saying eternal punishment must
      refer to perpetually inflicted torment. I agree with the way he stated
      this argument, and it's solid. The argument still must be made that death
      is the punishment for sin, but everything checks out grammatically and
      logically with calling everlasting death an eternal punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. This argument is based on the love of God. I'm not going to focus on
      this one. I'm just going to stick to the ones that focus on exegesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This argument is about the fairness of hell. The argument that ECT is
      unfair can be made from the Bible. If a country has a law that says
      murders will face capital punishment but instead locks them up in a
      dungeon for torture, everyone would say that was unjust. Likewise, if God
      said that "the wages of sin is death" but instead keeps sinners alive to
      eternally torment them, that would be unjust. Of course, that argument
      assumes "death" really means death as in the Old Testament sacrificial
      system which Jesus fulfilled in dying on the cross, which brings us back
      to asking, what did God declare the just punishment of sin to be and how
      are we to understand that? However, he doesn't state this as a biblical
      argument but as an emotional one, so I won't focus on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. The last argument is that ECT would mar the new heavens and new earth.
      This argument can be bolstered. It is actually impossible for traditional
      hell to exist in the new heavens and new earth (Rev 21:4). Traditionalist
      scholar G. K. Beale writes that "the reality underlying the figurative
      lake of the second death must exist somewhere else, perhaps in a different
      dimension from that of the new creation" (<a
        href="https://archive.org/stream/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/Revelation_G.Beale_djvu.txt"
        target="_blank"
        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, 1061), but the Bible doesn’t say that. It specifically says they will
      be resurrected on this earth to face judgment. Moreover, God has "no
      pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Eze 33:11). If death means ECT, then
      God would eternally be sustaining something that brings Him no pleasure.
      We will be made like God, so we will take no pleasure in the ECT of the
      wicked either. Again though, Carson only raises this as a philosophical
      argument.
    </p>
    <h2>C. Biblical and Theological Responses</h2>
    <p>
      Carson begins his response by addressing the terms Sheol and Hades. He is
      right that they "have roughly the same semantic range and overtones." Both
      refer to "the abode of the dead." He is also correct that there is a
      mention of torment in Hades (Lk 16:23), although many believe this is an
      example story much like the story of the good Samaritan (10:25:37), the
      rich fool (12:13-21), or the Pharisee and the tax collector (18:9-14). If
      that’s the case, then this story is a graphic portrayal of the dichotomy
      between the fate of the righteous and the damned after death, but the
      details are not necessarily intended to be actual descriptions of Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Carson goes off course when he tries to conflate Hades with
      Gehenna (the
      <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1035.htm" target="_blank"
        >Catechism of the Catholic Church</a
      >
      #1035 makes this same error). Hades is the abode of the dead
      <em>before</em> they are raised and cast into Gehenna. It is not the final
      state. The reason he gives for this is that Revelation 20:10, 14 link
      Hades with the lake of fire. So now Carson conflates Gehenna, the lake of
      fire, and Hades. Gehenna is a real valley outside of Jerusalem, also known
      as the Valley of Slaughter, which depicts the destruction of soul and
      body. The lake of fire is a symbolic picture in John's vision which
      corresponds to the second death (Rev 20:15; 21:8). Even the verses Carson
      cites maintain a clear distinction between Hades and the lake of fire.
      Hades releases its dead, so that they can be judged and thrown into the
      lake of fire. Subsequently, Hades itself is thrown into the lake of fire,
      demonstrating that they are two different places:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged,
        each one according to his works. Death and Hades were thrown into the
        lake of fire" (Rev 20:13-14).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Carson moves on to define Gehenna, the name of the place that actually
      refers to the final fate of the wicked. Carson repeats the myth that
      Gehenna was "the burning dump outside of Jerusalem." Traditionalist
      scholar Robert Reymond at least informs the reader that the garbage dump
      theory first comes "from late Jewish tradition (David Qimchi, c. A.D.
      1200)" in his treatment, but Carson doesn't do that. He also doesn't
      inform the reader of Jeremiah 7 or 19 which prophesy about future
      eschatological judgment of Gehenna (that might be important context!):
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more
        be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The
        valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no
        place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds
        of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them
        away'" (Jer 7:32-33).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      This is a large part of the background for Jesus' teaching about Gehenna
      (Gehenna is derived from the Hebrew <em>Ge Hinnom</em> meaning “Valley of
      Hinnom”). Gehenna will be called "The Valley of Slaughter." God will slay
      His enemies there. The worms, birds, and other scavengers will devour the
      dead bodies cast there, and the fire will burn up and consume them.
      Gehenna is a vivid picture of death, destruction, and annihilation, not
      eternal torment. This refutes Carson's claim that Gehenna conveys "notions
      of suffering" by which he means torment without death. Gehenna is about
      the wicked undergoing the punishment for sin, death (Rom 6:23), death
      forever (Jn 11:26), perish (Jn 3:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      He then cites parallel passages in which Jesus warns of the destruction of
      body and soul which will take place in Gehenna. How can we expect anyone
      to live in Gehenna forever? Surely God casting his enemies into Gehenna,
      destroying them soul and body, and burning up their dead bodies which are
      consumed by scavengers does not permit an eternal torment reading:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill
        the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
        Gehenna." "But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him who after
        he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna." (Mat 10:28 // Lk 12:5).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Carson proceeds to cite Romans 2:5-9, 11, 16 in favor of ECT, but no
      support can be found there. Rather than an eternity of wrath, Paul speaks
      of a "day of wrath" (2:5) when God "will pay back to everyone according to
      their works" (2:6). Paul writes that "now, being made free from sin" we
      have "the result of eternal life" (6:22), but "the wages of sin is death"
      (6:23). God is the "potter,” and we are "clay" (9:21). The wicked are clay
      "vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" (9:23). While Paul doesn't
      mention Gehenna by name, he certainly doesn't shy away from addressing the
      final fate which awaits unbelievers in Gehenna—death and destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson cites another passage from Paul, 2 Thessalonians 1:9, but he cites
      the NIV which renders the verse very inaccurately. The NIV: "everlasting
      destruction and shut out from." The ESV: "eternal destruction, away from."
      The NLT: "eternal destruction, forever separated from." However, the Greek
      literally reads, "eternal destruction from [<em>apo</em>] the presence of
      the Lord." The phrases "and shut out," "away," and "forever separated" are
      not in the Greek but are interpretive and misleading. Going with the
      alternative rendering in the footnote of the ESV, the verse reads:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction that comes from
        the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      They will be destroyed forever from an encounter with God's presence. No
      ECT here. Moreover, verses 7-8 provide important context because they
      reference Isaiah 66:15: "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his
      chariots will be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness,
      and his rebuke with flames of fire." It goes on to say, "For Yahweh will
      execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh; and those slain by
      Yahweh will be many" (Isa 66:16). And in the next chapter, Paul says that
      "the Lord will kill [the lawless one] with the breath of his mouth and
      destroy by the manifestation of his coming" (2 Thes 2:8) reinforcing that
      the destruction comes from the presence of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next verse that Carson cites is another reference to Isaiah 66.
      Jesus connects Gehenna and Isaiah 66 with a direct quote, describing it as
      the place "where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched" (Mk
      9:48 // Isa 66:24). We just saw a few verses earlier in Isaiah that God's
      enemies were slain. In the part Jesus quotes from, it describes "the new
      heavens and the new earth" where believers "will go out, and look at the
      dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm
      will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome
      to all mankind" (Isa 66:22-24). In the final judgment, unbelievers will be
      slain and burned up by God. Believers will walk out and see their corpses.
      Isaiah says that explicitly, and both Jesus and Paul attest to that
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He points out that the judgment is characterized by "weeping and gnashing
      of teeth" (Mat 8:12), but the crying and anger is never said to last
      eternally. Of course that is the reaction of people facing the judgment of
      God, but it is no support for ECT. That phrase is even used in conjunction
      with people perishing: "The wicked will see it, and be grieved. He shall
      gnash with his teeth, and melt away" (Ps 112:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson says that there "is no escape from hell: there is a great fixed
      chasm (Luke 16:26)." Again, he is conflating Hades (which is the actual
      word used in this verse) with Gehenna. This verse is irrelevant to the
      final judgment. There is a time when everyone will be brought out of
      Hades, "the abode of the dead" (his own definition). Then the wicked will
      face judgment and be cast into Gehenna from which there is no return.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we check the verses Carson cites about the "'everlasting chains' (2
      Peter 2:4; Jude 6)," we read that angels (not humans) are "kept in
      everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day" and
      that God "committed them to pits of darkness to be reserved for judgment."
      The chains hold angels <em>for</em> the judgment of the great day. It does
      not say that angels will have chains eternally, it is not about the final
      judgment and it isn't even about humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we check the verse that Carson cites to support the claim that the
      "lost 'suffer the punishment of eternal fire' (Jude 7)," we read that
      Sodom and Gomorrah "are exhibited as an example in undergoing the
      punishment of eternal fire" (NASB). The historical example of the complete
      destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire functions typologically to show
      what will happen to the wicked on judgment day. The eternal fire inflicted
      complete destruction:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh
        out of the sky. He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. But Lot’s
        wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
        Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood
        before Yahweh. He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
        land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the
        smoke of a furnace." (Gen 19:24-28).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Carson writes that they "suffer 'everlasting contempt' (Dan. 12:2)," but
      Daniel denies that they will live forever. Daniel 12:2 is connected to
      Isaiah 66:24 by the words "contempt" and "loathsome" which are the only
      occurrences of the Hebrew word
      <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_1860.htm" target="_blank"
        >deraon</a
      >. Isaiah writes that the “dead bodies” of the wicked "will be loathsome
      to all mankind." Just as contempt for Nero outlives his life, Daniel is
      saying that contempt for unbelievers will last forever, and he contrasts
      that fate with "everlasting life." The two are mutually exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that Carson has limited space and cannot explain every point
      in this section, but the rapid-fire proof texting used in this section
      does not reflect the "more careful exegesis" that supposedly supports the
      traditionalist view. It was more of the same basic mistakes that
      characterize many traditionalist writings like mixing up Hades with
      Gehenna, getting the background for Gehenna wrong, using verses that are
      clearly translated inaccurately, citing passages about the intermediate
      state as if they were about Gehenna, and not addressing the passages that
      the NT authors keep quoting from like Isaiah 66 to understand the context.
      It is always better to explain a few passages carefully than many passages
      in this way.
    </p>
    <p>Carson offers six reflections at this point:</p>
    <p>
      1. He begins by addressing <em>apollumi</em>. I already cited an in-depth
      word study of <em>apollumi</em> in the first argument. A quote from Edward
      White's
      <a
        href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_in_Christ.html?id=bvsCAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false"
        target="_blank"
        >Life in Christ</a
      >
      makes the point forcefully: "My mind fails to conceive a grosser
      misinterpretation of language than when the five or six strongest words
      which the Greek tongue possesses, signifying ‘destroy,’ or ‘destruction,’
      are explained to mean maintaining an everlasting but wretched existence.
      To translate black as white is nothing to this" (365). Carson writes, "<em
        >of course</em
      >
      those who suffer <em>destruction</em> are <em>destroyed</em>. But it does
      not follow that those who suffer eternal destruction cease to exist."
      Torment is not destruction and arguing that they don't "cease to exist" is
      not addressing the argument. They are as "natural animals to be taken and
      destroyed... [and] will in their destroying surely be destroyed" (2 Pet
      2:12). They will be reduced to ashes (2 Pet 2:6; cf. Mal 4:1-3; Isa
      66:24). They "won’t see life" (Jn 3:36).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson fails to engage meaningfully with Stott on this point. He writes,
      "Stott, for instance, argues that [the words for destroy]... [best] refer
      to cessation of existence" and their use "suggests cessation of
      existence." He then counters that the word group for destroy can refer to
      something lost or ruined: "in neither case is cessation of existence in
      view" and that it would only be plausible "if 'life' means no more than
      mere existence." He concludes, "Stott has assumed his definition of
      'destruction'" as cessation of existence, and "the issue must itself be
      decided on other grounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Stott does not assume his view, Carson just ignores his
      arguments, and Stott's view isn't that destruction means "cease to exist."
      In context, Stott writes, "When the verb [<em>apollymi</em>] is active and
      transitive, 'destroy' means 'kill,' as when Herod wanted to murder the
      baby Jesus and the Jewish leaders later plotted to have him executed (Matt
      2:13; 12:14; 27:4)... (Matt 10:28; cf. Jas 4:12)" (Edwards and Stott,
      <em>Essentials</em>, 314-16). In other words, destruction is about
      killing, the taking of life, not the cessation of existence. The
      traditional view denies that God will finally kill the wicked and holds
      that they will live forever in torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stott goes on to write, "If to kill is to deprive the body of life, hell
      would seem to be the deprivation of both physical and spiritual life, that
      is, extinction of being" (by which he means the total loss of life), and
      the Sermon on the Mount contrasts the "'road that leads to life' with the
      'broad... road that leads to destruction' (Matt 7:13...)." It should be
      very clear now that saying death doesn't mean non-existence is a complete
      non-answer. The argument needs to be made that destruction doesn't refer
      to the ending of life or else it is only attacking a straw man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, in the passage Carson uses to argue that life means "more than
      mere existence," John 3:16, he agrees with the conditionalist framing that
      "'life' and 'destruction' are contrasted." The category John is using is
      life. Given the contrast with life, destruction (<em>apollymi</em>)
      indicates death. This is supported by the immediate context in John
      3:14-15 where Jesus compares Himself to the bronze serpant which the
      Israelites could look at to save their literal, physical lives (Num 21:9).
      Carson quotes Timothy Philips in "Hell: A Christological Reflection" that
      "Christ is contrasting two qualitatively different types of existence,"
      but there are absolutely no reasons given for why we should accept this.
      It also demonstrates that traditionalists are the ones using the category
      of existence instead of life and forcing that lens on the Bible and on
      conditionalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while traditionalists repeat many times the objection that death does
      not mean non-existence, I hope it is clear now that existence isn't the
      right category. Death is about life and death. The second death is about
      being killed and dying, the destruction of body and soul, the loss of
      bodily and spiritual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Carson argues that eternal punishment cannot refer to the result of
      the punishment being eternal in Matthew 25:46 but must refer to an ongoing
      process of punishing. He cites several scholars that agree with him, but
      this is obviously wrong. In English and Greek, punishment is a generic
      word that can refer to various kinds of punishments, and eternal can refer
      to either an everlasting state or process. Simply put, the punishment for
      sin is death, the death is eternal, so the punishment is eternal,
      everlasting, never-ending death. I'll quote a few articles that explain it
      well and provide more depth:
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris Date writes that "Punishment, whether in English or in Greek, is
      polysemous. And it is context and the nature of the punishment that
      determine whether it carries a process or result reading. The modifier
      'eternal' does not give it a process reading, anymore than it does
      'salvation' and 'redemption' in the epistle to the Hebrews" (<a
        href="https://rethinkinghell.com/2013/06/02/no-retreat-on-nouns-of-action-turretinfans-premature-celebration/"
        target="_blank"
        >No Retreat on Nouns of Action: TurretinFan's Premature Celebration</a
      >, 2013).
    </p>
    <p>
      In another article, Christ Date notes that "many deverbal nouns are
      polysemous, ambiguous between a process or result meaning. For example,
      the phrase, 'The translation of the book took ten years,' means that the
      process of translating lasted ten years. The phrase, 'The translation has
      been published recently,' on the other hand, means that the translation
      that resulted from, or was the outcome of, the translating process was
      recently published" (<a
        href="https://rethinkinghell.com/2012/06/19/eternal-punishment-and-the-polysemy-of-deverbal-nouns/"
        target="_blank"
        >"Punishment" and the Polysemy of Deverbal Nouns</a
      >, 2012).
    </p>
    <p>
      And building off the previous example, Joseph Dear summarizes, "The
      question is, what meaning of 'punishment' was intended? Was Jesus
      referring to the act of punishing (like 'the translation of the book took
      ten years'), or was he referring to the result of the act of punishing
      (like 'the translation has been published recently')? Either one would be
      'punishment'" (<a
        href="https://rethinkinghell.com/2014/01/15/matthew-2546-does-not-prove-eternal-torment-part-1/"
        target="_blank"
        >Matthew 25:46 Does Not Prove Eternal Torment – Part 1</a
      >, 2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Carson moves on to arguments about the descriptions of hell. The first
      one he addresses is that the fire is a consuming fire. Fire describes
      destruction, not torment:
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson's initial response to this argument is that most "interpreters
      recognize that there is a substantial metaphorical element in the Bible's
      descriptions of hell." He tries to show that the Bible uses contradictory
      language to describe hell to substantiate this claim. However, he does
      this by mixing up symbolic depictions of the final judgment in Revelation,
      descriptions of Hades (the intermediate state), and scenes from parables
      with actual descriptions of Gehenna, and he interprets the actual
      descriptions of Gehenna in a wooden and silly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attitude that the biblical language about hell is obviously
      metaphorical will not do. I do not accept that. A little work in the Old
      Testament background and context of these passages reveals a consistent,
      noncontradictory teaching that the wicked will finally perish in Gehenna.
      Only conditionalism can take the biblical descriptions of hell and the
      language of life, death, perishing, destruction, slaying, burning up,
      Gehenna, etc. in their natural sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional view relies fundamentally on the metaphorical
      interpretation of passages about the final fate of the wicked with an
      improper literal interpretation of Revelation, while the conditionalist
      view relies fundamentally on a literal, straightforward interpretation of
      passages about the final fate of the wicked with a proper symbolic
      interpretation of Revelation. Refuting the over-allegorizing tendencies of
      the traditional view destroys a core pillar undergirding the belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson uses three examples to support the allegorizing of Gehenna and its
      descriptions, which I will state and then challenge:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) We don't normally "think of unquenchable fire and worms coexisting."
      We might not normally think of that, but there is nothing contradictory
      about Gehenna consisting of fire and maggots. Those are specific
      descriptions of the dead bodies being destroyed. The fire can't be put out
      and the worms can't be killed, so that they will carry out the destruction
      of the dead bodies of the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) "It is hard to imagine how a lake of fire coexists with utter
      darkness." The lake of fire is a symbolic picture in Revelation which is
      interpreted as the second death, literally dying a second time in the age
      to come (Rev 21:8). Outer darkness is a parabolic way of describing
      refusal to the Kingdom of God such as when the servant is tied hand and
      foot and thrown out of the wedding feast into outer darkness by the King
      (Mat 22:1-14). It is also obvious that the servant, being bound hand and
      foot and thrown into the Judean wilderness, will surely die, not merely
      experience torment in the parable. Angels are also described as being held
      "under darkness" (Jude 6 // 2 Pet 2:4), but this is referring to the
      intermediate state before the final judgment. Conditionalists affirm that
      the wicked will be refused entrance to the Kingdom of God, will face the
      second death, and that the angels are held under darkness for the judgment
      in the intermediate state. None of those suggest that we need to
      allegorize Gehenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) If "one is cast into a lake of fire, what need of chains?" Again, the
      lake of fire is a graphic portrayal of the death of the wicked in John's
      vision. And as previously mentioned, the chains hold angels for judgment
      day (Jude 6 // 2 Pet 2:4). The chains are not about Gehenna. These are
      still not good reasons to metaphorically interpret passages about Gehenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson continues by asking, what sustains the worms (because they are said
      to not die) if they have already consumed the people? But nowhere are the
      worms said to be eternal worms. It doesn't say they will never die
      <em>ever</em>. That's like arguing that the statement, "Bob won't get off
      the video game" means that, "Bob won't get off the video game
      <em>ever</em>." Obviously, there is a context in both situations: Bob
      won't get off the video game until he finishes his match, and the worm
      won't die until they finish consuming their meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the language is interpreted woodenly to mean that the worms will
      never die ever, this would only mean that there are worms which will live
      forever. This can't be used as support that the wicked will live forever
      because they are already dead forever at this point. Carson says that his
      question was "ugly and silly, precisely because it is demanding a concrete
      and this-worldly answer to the use of language describing the realities of
      punishment in a future world still largely inconceivable." Instead, it
      appears that his question was "ugly and silly" because it relies on
      understanding the phrase "their worm does not die" out of context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson points to several more reasons he believes the annihilationist
      reading is wrong:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) It is called "their worm" rather than "the worm" which "suggests that
      it is perpetually bound up with those who are suffering." This is a
      strange argument. It was not written "the worm" because it isn't a
      specific worm that won't die, nor worms in general that won't die. It's
      "their worm" because it's referring to the worms consuming their bodies.
      And as a reminder, the context is not about worms eating "those who are
      suffering," but is about the "dead bodies of the men who have transgressed
      against me; for their worm will not die…" (Isa 66:24 // Mk 9:48).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) The logic of this argument is that the "unquenchable fire" is a fire
      that cannot be extinguished so that it either burns up but does not last
      forever or burns forever but does not burn up. He claims that the former
      interpretation has difficulties because "unquenchable fire" is paralleled
      with "eternal fire" (Mat 18:8). Carson's initial framing of this argument
      is a false dilemma. The fire could last forever but still burn up. Earlier
      in Matthew, it is explicitly stated that they "will burn up [katakaió]
      with unquenchable fire" like chaff (Mat 3:12). Katakaió means to burn down
      utterly, incinerate, or consume wholly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That still leaves the question of what eternal fire means in Matthew 18:8
      and 25:41. Before these verses, Matthew indicates that the hellfire will
      burn up (3:12; 7:19; 13:40, 42, 50), the wicked will be destroyed
      (7:13-14; 10:28), and they will perish in Gehenna (5:22; 5:29; 10:28). The
      word <em>aiōnios</em> means eternal. The eternal fire/punishment refers to
      that ultimate punishment of the age to come which is the everlasting
      destruction of soul and body by fire from Yahweh resulting in the final
      and total loss of life, the never-ending death, of the wicked forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is confirmed by Jude's use of the phrase “eternal fire.” Jude 7 tells
      us that the final punishment of "eternal fire" looks like the historical
      destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. 2 Peter 2:6, the parallel passage,
      says, "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned
      them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live
      in an ungodly way." Because the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah underwent
      "the punishment of eternal fire" and those cities are not still burning, I
      believe the source of the fire, Yahweh, is being described as an eternal
      fire, "for our God is a consuming fire" (Heb 12:29). However, even if this
      is undestood in a different way, it is clear that this eternal fire
      utterly consumes the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final objection Carson raises is that this view would deny degrees of
      punishment. He says, "must we not also infer that fire consumes everyone
      at more or less the same rate"? No, of course not. That inference is not
      from the text and is clearly wrong. There are different degrees of fire,
      which consume people at different rates. It is conceivable that some could
      be instantly incinerated while others are slowly burned to death, so this
      objection fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing that more in-depth section, Carson writes that the
      conditionalist interpretation appears to go astray "because illegitimate
      and arbitrary inferences are being drawn from the language, against the
      more natural readings, in order to support a theory that is being imposed
      on the text." However, this seems to reveals an error of mistaking what
      feels like for modern readers are "more natural readings" with what the
      text actually means.
    </p>
    <p>
      For modern readers (myself included), the phrase "weeping and gnashing of
      teeth" sounds like eternal torment. I grew up thinking that's what that
      meant; however, that anger and sadness is never said to last forever. An
      "unquenchable fire" sounds like a fire that is burning people perpetually,
      but "unquenchable" means "inextinguishable." If your house caught on fire
      with an unquenchable fire, it would burn down completely because
      firefighters couldn't put it out. The word hell itself has the definition
      of a place of eternal torment in most people’s minds, but it is a place
      name in the Greek, Gehenna, a valley outside of Jerusalem with an Old
      Testament background. Jude 7 describes the destruction of Sodom and
      Gomorrah by "sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky" (Gen 19:24) as
      "the punishment of eternal fire." Understanding that the eternal fire
      consumes and destroys God's enemies may not be a “natural reading” for
      people in a different context, but the Bible clearly defines it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could multiply examples, but the point is that the idea of hell as a
      place of eternal torment is thoroughly ingrained in our culture and
      traditions. However, when we examine the Old Testament backgrounds,
      perform careful word studies, and are willing to conform our beliefs to
      the Word of God, all the evidence seems to point squarely towards
      annihilationism.
    </p>
    <h2>The Big Three</h2>
    <p>
      Next, Carson moves on to address the big three traditionalist proof texts.
      I call them the big three because they are the most commonly cited proof
      texts for ECT. They are typically not analyzed in detail and are assumed
      to unequivocally teach ECT. Without these three verses, ECT could never
      get off the ground, but with them, the entire Bible is reinterpreted to
      line up with ECT. These texts are Revelation 14:10-11, Revelation 20:10-15
      and Matthew 25:46. Upon closer inspection, they are actually strong proofs
      for conditional immortality.
    </p>
    <p>Revelation 14:9-11:</p>
    <p>
      "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
      anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
      forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of
      God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
      tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in
      the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and
      ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his
      image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The language of fire and sulfur is found in references to Sodom and
      Gomorrah (Gen 19:24; Deut 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isa 30:27-33; 34:9-11; Ezek
      38:22). It paints a picture of decisive annihilation and complete
      destruction, leaving nothing but ashes and rising smoke in its wake.
      Notice that the smoke from the torment is said to last forever, not the
      torment itself. The image of rising smoke also comes from the account of
      Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:28) and symbolizes the permanent destruction of
      the wicked. This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause
        of Zion. Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur,
        and its land will become burning pitch. It won’t be quenched night or
        day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation, it
        will lie waste. No one will pass through it forever and ever."
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Carson recognizes these allusions but says he suspects that there must
      have been some amount of torment in Sodom, Gomorrah, and Edom, so surely
      the suffering part was typological of the final judgment. However, the
      "sufferings of Edom in Isaiah 34" were unto everlasting destruction. The
      account of Sodom and Gomorrah is also unequivocally about death and
      destruction. He cites Jude 7 and arbitrarily says that the "suffering" is
      typological of the judgment despite the parallel passage explicitly
      stating that the destruction and reduction to ashes is: "and turning the
      cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction,
      having made them an example to those who would live in an ungodly way" (2
      Pet 2:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah says that Edom’s fire "won’t be quenched night or day." Like
      Isaiah, John is saying that the fire burns continuously without ceasing
      "day or night" during the period of torment. It is a ceaseless activity,
      and a restless time. Carson objects to this interpretation of "night and
      day" calling it "special pleading" because the order in Revelation is
      torment, fire, smoke, and then no rest, while in Isaiah the order is fire,
      no rest, and then smoke. But all of these are just descriptions of
      different aspects of the judgment with recognizable OT allusions. Carson
      says that "writers like Fudge constantly resort to serialization of these
      elements," but that is exactly what he is doing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionalist scholar G. K. Beale agrees that this passage is not
      decisive for ECT: "In particular, 'day and night' (ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός) in
      14:11 can be taken as a qualitative genitive construction indicating not
      duration of time (like the accusative construction of the same phrase) but
      kind of time, that is, time of ceaseless activity... The lack of rest will
      continue uninterrupted as long as the period of suffering lasts, though
      there will be an end to the period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11
      could indicate a great judgment that will be remembered forever, not one
      that leads to eternal suffering" (<a
        href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/762/mode/1up"
        target="_blank"
        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, 762).
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if we consider that John describes the destruction of Babylon in
      Revelation 17-19 with the same language of torment, fire, and smoke from
      the burning ascending forever, we have ample reason to believe that John
      intends the same meaning here:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        "Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did,
        and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her
        double... Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning,
        and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire, for the Lord God
        who has judged her is strong… The kings of the earth who committed
        sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her will weep and wail over
        her, when they look at the smoke of her burning, standing far away for
        the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the
        strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour’... and [they] cried
        out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like
        the great city?’..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great
        multitude in heaven, saying, 'Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory
        belong to our God; for his judgments are true and righteous. For he has
        judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual
        immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.' A
        second said, 'Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever.'" (Rev
        18:6, 8-10, 18; 19:1-3).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Beale also agrees that the rising smoke in these passages refer to a
      permanent memorial of judgment: "what is precisely underscored is the
      finality of Babylon’s judgment: ‘her smoke ascends forever.’ The wording
      comes from Isa. 34:9-10, where the portrayal of smoke continually
      ascending serves as a permanent memorial to God’s punishment of Edom for
      its sin. Rev. 14:11 also alludes to Isa. 34:9-10 to describe the
      never-ending effect of God’s judgment of the beast’s followers. Here
      Edom’s fall is taken as an anticipatory typological pattern for the fall
      of the world system, which will never rise again after God’s judgment" (<a
        href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/279/mode/1up"
        target="_blank"
        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, 929).
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also be taken into account that the very next picture of
      judgment immediately following these verses mentions the “wine of the
      wrath of God” again and is clearly about death: “The angel thrust his
      sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth and threw it
      into the great wine press of the wrath of God. The wine press was trodden
      outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, up to the
      bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia” (Rev
      14:19-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson provides a quote from Harmon's
      <em>The Case Against Conditionalism</em>
      which objects to conditionalism because "destruction dominates while
      punishment and exclusion fall into the background. Indeed, the latter
      image is hardly discussed." Conditionalists believe the punishment is
      death and destruction, so that part of the objection doesn't work. It is
      true that unbelievers will be excluded from the Kingdom of God, eternal
      life and a part in the age to come, but that is precisely because they
      will perish, suffer destruction, and die a second death. Exclusion and
      separation from God are almost exclusively how traditionalists describe
      hell, but that is not how the Bible predominantly describes it. This very
      passage contradicts that. The judgment will take place "in the presence of
      the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
    </p>
    <p>Revelation 20:10-15:</p>
    <p>
      "The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur,
      where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day
      and night forever and ever... The sea gave up the dead who were in it.
      Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each
      one according to his works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
      fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. If anyone was not found
      written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      G. K. Beale has helpful commentary on this passage as well: "Strictly
      speaking, even the expression 'they will be tormented forever and ever' is
      figurative... at the least, the phrase figuratively connotes a very long
      time. The context here and in the whole Apocalypse must determine whether
      this is a limited time or an unending period... All unbelievers suffering
      the first death are held in the sphere of 'death and Hades,' which is a
      temporary, preconsummate holding tank to be finally replaced by the
      permanent, consummate 'lake of fire,' which is 'the second death' (see on
      20:14)" (<a
        href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/1025/mode/1up?view=theater"
        target="_blank"
        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, 1030).
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that Carson is correct about the three figures in 20:10 rather
      than John Stott, John sees a vision in which the three figures, the devil,
      the beast and the false prophet, are tormented for an extraordinarily long
      period of time. Carson interprets these figures for us: the devil,
      depicted as a dragon and a serpent, is Satan, and the beast and false
      prophet "are best thought of as recurring individuals, culminating in
      supreme manifestations of their type." Those whose names are not written
      in the book of life are the enemies of Christ. Death and Hades are
      personified individuals in Revelation. Hades and Death give up the dead
      who were in them, meaning everyone is resurrected, and those who are not
      saved are judged and cast into the lake of fire. Afterwards, Death and
      Hades are also thrown in. John and God Himself interpret the vision of the
      "lake of fire" for us: it is the "second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). The
      vision he sees represents the execution, the killing, the death and final
      judgment of the wicked in the age to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson says that Satan "constitutes at least one sentient being who is
      clearly pictured as suffering conscious torment forever." Even if the
      language demanded that the picture is of Satan suffering ECT, the
      authoritative interpretation given twice is that this is a picture of
      death. However, the language doesn't demand that we understand it in a
      strickly literal way. John is recording a vision. He couldn't see an
      eternal process in a vision; however, he could clearly tell they were
      suffering for a very long time, and the language he uses reflects that
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last argument for this text that Carson gives is that it is reasonable
      to assume that if Satan is going to suffer ECT in the lake of fire, the
      unrighteous will too. Again, it is not necessary to understand the vision
      of the lake of fire as ECT, and the interpretation of the vision is still
      death which Carson does not address. But more fundementally, it is
      improper to derive doctrine from unclear inferences, or from a visions
      without the interpretation of the vision, or from less clear passages. We
      have plently of clear didactic passages which tell us that the final fate
      of the wicked is death.
    </p>
    <p>Matthew 25:46:</p>
    <p>
      "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
      eternal life."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the fire leads to destruction, the "eternal" aspect is in the
      everlasting nature of the destruction, not in a continuous experience of
      punishment. This verse specifically sets up a contrast between the eternal
      punishment of the unrighteous and the eternal life of the righteous. This
      precludes the possibility of the unrighteous experiencing eternal life.
      While the righteous experience life that is eternal in duration (unending
      and ongoing life), the unrighteous face death that is eternal in duration
      (unending and ongoing death).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson responds that "annihilationists again introduce temporal
      serialization: first the fire that annihilates, then the eternal
      punishment which in fact constitutes the nonreversing of the
      annihilation." However, that misunderstands the argument. We also say that
      Jesus bore the punishment for our sins by His death, but we aren’t denying
      that Christ’s sufferings on the cross were part of that punishment.
      Likewise, we say that death is the punishment for sins, but we aren’t
      denying that suffering will be part of that death. The destruction by fire
      is the punishment in the same way that the cross was the punishment for
      Jesus, both of which were carried out in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as the duration of the punishment goes, the length of the death of
      the wicked is eternal in the same way that Jesus' death lasted three days.
      Just as chopping off a criminal’s finger for stealing is completed quickly
      but constitutes a lifelong punishment, the destruction by fire is carried
      out in a finite amount of time but constitutes an eternal punishment. The
      nature of the punishment is privation which means that the length of the
      effect of the punishment, the duration of the privation, is the proper
      characterization of the duration of the punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul explicitly states that the punishment is "eternal destruction" (2
      Thes 1:9). The eternal punishment is eternal destruction which is eternal
      death, to "die forever" (Jn 11:26 LEB). This is not new or controversial
      language. It flows straight from biblical language about sin and judgment.
      The phrase "eternal death" has been used for centuries to describe the
      eternal punishment (e.g. by John Calvin, Francis Turretin, and Douglas
      Moo; see Miscellaneous for more examples). It is even used in the
      <a href="https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_03" target="_blank"
        >Westminster Confession of Faith</a
      >
      (1647) which is still held to by millions of evangelicals today: "By the
      decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are
      predestinated unto everlasting life; and others foreordained to
      everlasting death" (3.3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carson appeals to the lake of fire in Revelation 20 for support that the
      torment is eternal; however, as noted above, the language in Revelation
      need only refer to a long period of torment, which makes sense in context
      because the lake of fire is the second death. Carson says the "word
      'punishment' is graphic, and at least suggests suffering." The word
      punishment (κόλασιν) can refer to all kinds of different punishments
      including capital punishment. And just because conditionalists believe
      that the final punishment is capital punishment (execution), does not mean
      that torment will not be involved. Burning at the stake, crucifixion, and
      the electric chair are all forms of capital punishment with varying
      degrees of torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next argument has been a driving assumption for the continued belief
      in ECT. Carson writes that "Jesus could not have used such words as these
      without being understood to be in line with Pharisaic beliefs on the
      matter." The assumption for a long time was that ECT became the majority
      view during the intertestamental period. This meant that we should read
      the NT with the assumption of ECT. However, we now know that
      conditionalism was by far the majority view during the intertestamental
      period in keeping with the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pharisaic/rabbinic schools believed there would be three final
      destinies of people: heaven, an in-between group that might go to hell
      temporarily, or hell. Jesus very clearly rejects this teaching of the
      Pharisees. He taught that there are only two fates, heaven and hell, that
      hell’s punishment is eternal, and that even Jews could go to hell if they
      didn't repent and believe. David Instone-Brewer, Baptist Minister and
      Senior Research Fellow in Rabbinics at Cambridge, reviewing the primary
      literature in
      <em>Eternal Punishment in First-Century Jewish Thought</em> concludes,
      “This means the verse stating that ‘punishment’ is eternal should be
      understood to mean that torment plus destruction is eternal—without any
      means of escape—because this is what his contemporaries meant when they
      used the same language” (A Consuming Passion, Eugene: Pickwick, 2015). The
      literature from the Apostolic Fathers reflects the same understanding. It
      would not be until the middle and latter half of the second century that
      the doctrine of ECT developed in the church, and the language of eternal
      punishment became increasingly misunderstood after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Carson argues that annihilation cannot account for the "eternal sin"
      (Mk 3:29) which "will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to
      come" (Mat 12:32), but this is another objection that doesn't stick. If
      sinners had their sins forgiven, they would be able to enter life. But
      since people who commit this sin will not be forgiven, they will face the
      punishment of eternal destruction. God doesn't forgive them, but instead
      counts their sin against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the claim is made many times, annihilationism is not a softening
      of hell. ECT is just a softening of the value of life. Even if the final
      death of unbelievers is more emotionally tolerable to some people, it is
      simply an attempt to understand the Bible more accurately. However, I
      would strongly argue that annihilationism is a harsher view of hell. Only
      one view teaches that God will finally rid the cosmos of sin forever,
      accomplish justice once and for all rather than having an eternally
      unfinished punishment, and will take every good thing away from sinners
      including their very lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, much of traditionalism is guilty of softening the
      language about hell without biblical warrent. Hell has been almost
      completely psychologized by traditionalists. He says he is "reluctant to
      say that none of this suffering is physical in some sense," but he takes a
      very metaphorical view of hell. This is quite different than the Bible’s
      very physical descriptions of punishment. The unjust are raised physically
      to receive their punishment (Jn 5:28-29) which consists of torment and
      fire. There is also a recent view among traditionalists that the wicked
      will eventually have some kind of sub-human existence while suffering ECT,
      but this is based on philosophical speculation. If those who believe that
      alter their view slightly, they can affirm with the Bible that the wicked
      will indeed be turned into ashes and perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The final vision of the cosmos for conditionalists is one where God has
      destroyed all of His enemies. Death was the final enemy to be annihilated.
      The old things have passed away, and all things are made new. Christ will
      reconcile all things to himself, and everything will be subjected to the
      Father so that God may be all in all. From the traditional view, Carson
      says, "hell's inmates are full of sin." Wickedness is rampant in hell for
      all eternity. God will never finally stamp out evil but will instead grant
      the impenitent everlasting life. Justice will never be accomplished
      because the wicked will never receive all the punishment they deserve. In
      this view, it is hard to see how God has truly triumphed over evil when
      the rebels continue in their rebellion for eternity. This view appears
      more like an eternal dualism between good and evil than the Bible's
      description of God's final, decisive victory over sin, death, and evil.
    </p>
    <h2>D. Concluding Reflections</h2>
    <p>
      Carson writes that it "is getting harder and harder to be faithful to the
      'hard' lines of Scripture." Like many other traditionalists, Carson feels
      like he is fighting against liberals and compromisers in this debate over
      hell. I understand that feeling because ECT is a hard view emotionally for
      people, is in many protestant confessions, has been the traditional view
      for a long time, and is often attacked by liberals and cults.
      Notwithstanding all of those positive indicators, it appears that ECT
      simply does not stand up to biblical scrutiny. It misses the clear
      teaching that the gospel is a life and death issue, eternal life is only
      granted to believers, and unbelievers will finally perish in hell: "For
      God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that whoever
      believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life" (Jn 3:16).

    <h1>The Law</h1>
    <h2>Genesis 2:17</h2>
    <p>
      "but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for
      in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die."
    </p>
    <p>
      God warned Adam that he would surely die if he ate from the tree of the
      knowledge of good and evil. Natural, literal death is clearly intended
      here. Hence, in Genesis 3:19, God says, "you are dust, and you shall
      return to dust." The curses causing difficulty in working the land and in
      childbirth also indicate that death is intended. Therefore, God kicked
      Adam out of the garden when he sinned, "lest he reach out his hand, and
      also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever" (Gen 3:22). Paul
      explains that "as sin entered into the world through one man, and death
      through sin, so death passed to all men because all sinned." (Rom 5:12).
      Everyone in Adam is destined to perish and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Revelation, it is revealed that believers will get to partake of the
      tree of life and live forevermore: "On this side of the river and on that
      was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit
      every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
      (Rev 22:2). Paul explains that believers will be made unable to die: "The
      first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from
      heaven... Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit
      God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable... For
      this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on
      immortality." (1 Cor 15:47, 50, 53).
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that some will not inherit the imperishable nor receive
      immortality. They will be subject to everlasting death and won't obtain to
      the final age: "But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age
      and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in
      marriage. For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels and
      are children of God, being children of the resurrection" (Lk 20:35-36).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you struggle to see how this verse is indicating the certainty of death
      rather than its chronology, consider the verse with the addition of the
      phrase "it is true": "for in the day that you eat of it, it is true that
      you will surely die." The fundamental meaning of the text is exactly the
      same, but this is an easy way of understanding in English that this verse
      is conveying the certainty of death. In Hebrew, this is called an
      infinitive absolute.

    <p>
      Victor P. Hamilton, The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17, NICOT (Grand
      Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990), pg. 172: "Here in 2:17 we have translated it as
      <em>as surely as</em> on the basis of its occasional use as an idiom
      meaning 'for certain,' as in 1 K. 2:37, 42, where Shimei is threatened
      with death 'on the day you go forth and cross the brook Kidron.' As the
      next few verses indicate, Shimei could not possibly have been executed 'on
      the day' he exited his house. The verse is underscoring the certainty of
      death, not its chronology."

        >Warned of Sin's Wages: A Concise Explanation of Death in Genesis 2:17
        and Romans 6:23</a
      >, 2017: "In other words, 'you will certainly die' became true instantly,
      as a kind of death sentence or curse. In the Hebrew, this phrase is a
      language construct known as an infinitive absolute. It has no exact
      equivalent in English, and should be read not as a statement about when
      death will occur, but rather to emphasize the certainty of death being
      incurred."
    </p>

    <h2>Deuteronomy 29:20</h2>
    <p>
      "Yahweh will not pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will
      smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book
      will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked
      shall perish" (Ps 1:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and
      they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The
      dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books,
      according to their works. The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death
      and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one
      according to his works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
      This is the second death, the lake of fire. If anyone was not found
      written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire" (Rev
      20:12-15).
    </p>

    <h1>Wisdom</h1>
    <h2>Psalm 9:5-6</h2>
    <p>
      "You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have
      blotted out their name forever and ever. The enemy is overtaken by endless
      ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has
      perished."
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 11:6</h2>
    <p>
      "On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching
      wind shall be the portion of their cup."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then Yahweh rained
      on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky. He
      overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities,
      and that which grew on the ground. But Lot’s wife looked back from behind
      him, and she became a pillar of salt." (Gen 19:23-26).
    </p>
    <p>
      "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them
      to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live in an
      ungodly way" (2 Pet 2:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sodom and Gomorrah is a cited many times in the Old and New Testaments as
      representative of what God's judgment is like.
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 37:20 // 1:6</h2>
    <p>
      "But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the
      beauty of the fields. They will vanish— vanish like smoke."
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 37:38 // 37:10 // 37:28-29 // 37:34</h2>
    <p>
      "As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the
      wicked shall be cut off."
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 73:17-20 ESV</h2>
    <p>
      "then I discerned their end. Truly you set them in slippery places; you
      make them fall to ruin. How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away
      utterly by terrors! Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse
      yourself, you despise them as phantoms."
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 92:7 // 58:8 // 145:20</h2>
    <p>
      "though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers flourish,
      they will be destroyed forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord
      and from the glory of his might, when he comes in that day to be glorified
      in his saints and to be admired among all those who have believed, because
      our testimony to you was believed" (2 Thess 1:9-10).
    </p>

    <h2>Psalm 112:10</h2>
    <p>
      "The wicked will see it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth,
      and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth. The
      Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming." (Ps
      37:12-13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase gnashing of teeth indicates anger, annoyance, and being upset
      at the inability to stop something. Here it is used in conjunction with
      the wicked melting away and perishing. It does not suggest a perpetual
      process of suffering. Neither is gnashing of teeth ever said to last
      forever in the New Testament.
    </p>

    <h2>Proverbs 10:25, 27, 29-31</h2>
    <p>
      "When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; but the righteous stand
      firm forever... The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of the
      wicked shall be shortened... The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the
      upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. The righteous
      will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the land. The
      mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be
      cut off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead
      to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as
      well as to the saints and those who fear your name, to the small and the
      great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth" (Rev 11:18).
    </p>

    <h2>Proverbs 24:19-20</h2>
    <p>
      "Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers, neither be envious of the
      wicked; for there will be no reward to the evil man. The lamp of the
      wicked will be snuffed out."
    </p>

    <h2>Ecclesiastes 3:11</h2>
    <p>
      "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in
      their hearts, yet so that man can’t find out the work that God has done
      from the beginning even to the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      This verse does not teach the immortality of the soul. The Hebrew word
      "olam" is commonly translated as "darkness," "eternity," or "the future."
      This verse is about the insatiable longing for and awareness of something
      beyond this world that God has instilled in human hearts. Humans possess
      an inherent sense of something beyond the temporal world. Yet we are
      unable to fully understand God's workings or be ultimately satisfied in
      this world. This verse describes that existential reality.
    </p>

    <h1>The Prophets</h1>
    <h2>Isaiah 26:14, 19 (ESV)</h2>
    <p>
      "They are dead, they will not live; they are shades, they will not arise;
      to that end you have visited them with destruction and wiped out all
      remembrance of them... Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You
      who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of
      light, and the earth will give birth to the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah isn't denying a general future resurrection of all. He's denying
      that the wicked will get to participate in the resurrection life to come.
      They will come out "to the resurrection of judgment" while those saved by
      Jesus will come out "to the resurrection of life" (Jn 5:29). The wicked
      will face eternal destruction from the fires of Gehenna.
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 33:11-12, 14</h2>
    <p>
      "You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your breath is a
      fire that will devour you. The peoples will be like the burning of lime,
      like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire... The sinners in
      Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who among us can
      live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting
      burning?"

    <p>
      Isaiah provides the background for many of the New Testament’s teachings
      about hell. Chaff being burned represents complete devouring and
      destruction (Mat 3:12). Trees (Mat 7:19), weeds (Mat 13:40), and thorns
      and thistles (Heb 6:8) likewise are cut down and burned up. The obvious
      answer to Isaiah's rhetorical question, who among us can live, is that
      they will not be able to continue living in the midst of everlasting,
      devouring fire (Mat 18:8). The fire does not turn them into a juggernaut
      that can take on endless fire. While it may be possible to withstand fire
      for 5 or 10 minutes, this imagery conveys an utterly destructive power
      that will obliterate the wicked.
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 34:2-5, 8-10</h2>
    <p>
      "For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry with all their
      armies. He has utterly destroyed them. He has given them over for
      slaughter. Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead
      bodies will come up. The mountains will melt in their blood. All of the
      army of the sky will be dissolved. The sky will be rolled up like a
      scroll, and all its armies will fade away, as a leaf fades from off a vine
      or a fig tree. For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky. Behold, it will
      come down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, for judgment... For
      Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
      Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur, and its land
      will become burning pitch. It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke
      will go up forever. From generation to generation, it will lie waste. No
      one will pass through it forever and ever."
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 66:15-16</h2>
    <p>
      "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like
      the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with
      flames of fire. For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword
      on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus is the one who will execute judgment by a "flaming fire" (2 Thes
      1:7). The sword of judgment will fall on the on the lawless one, "whom the
      Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the
      manifestation of his coming" (2 Thes 2:8). Thus, many will be slain and
      face the penalty of "eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and
      from the glory of his might" (2 Thes 1:8).
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 66:22-24</h2>
    <p>
      "'For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
      remain before me,' says Yahweh, 'so your offspring and your name shall
      remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one
      Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,' says
      Yahweh. 'They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have
      transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire
      be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus uses this imagery of the worm not dying and the fire not being
      quenched in conjunction with Gehenna, a valley of dead bodies that serves
      as a picture of the final end for unbelievers. Notice that the context in
      both is about dead bodies in the new heavens and new earth. The worms will
      devour. The fire will completely consume. The unrighteous will forever be
      remembered with contempt. Though "unquenchable fire" strikes modern as
      eternal torment, the Old Testament background demonstrates that it refers
      to a consuming fire that cannot be extinguished.
    </p>

    <h2>Jeremiah 7:32-33 // 19:6-13</h2>
    <p>
      "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more be
      called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of
      Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
      The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and
      for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the background for Jesus' teaching about Gehenna (what is commonly
      translated hell, the final end for the unsaved). Gehenna will be called
      "The Valley of Slaughter." God will slay His enemies there. The worms,
      birds, and other scavengers will devour the dead bodies while fire burns
      up and consumes them. This picture intensely portrays death, destruction,
      and annihilation, not eternal torment.
    </p>

    <h2>Jeremiah 31:38-40</h2>
    <p>
      "'Behold, the days come,' says Yahweh, 'that the city will be built to
      Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner. The measuring
      line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn
      toward Goah. The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all
      the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the
      east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be plucked up or thrown down any
      more forever.'"
    </p>

    <h2>Daniel 12:2</h2>
    <p>
      "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to
      everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life,
      and some to disgrace and eternal contempt." [CSB]
    </p>
    <p>
      "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these
      to everlasting life, but the others to reproach and everlasting contempt."
      [LSB]
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the multitude of those sleeping in the dust of the ground do awake,
      some to life age-during, and some to reproaches -- to abhorrence
      age-during." [YTL]
    </p>
    <p>
      Contempt is the same word as
      <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1860.htm" target="_blank"
        >loathsome</a
      >
      in Isaiah 66:24, the only other occurance of that word in the Old
      Testament. Both verses speak of the comtempt of believers for the wicked.

    <h2>Nahum 1:8-10</h2>
    <p>
      "But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and
      will pursue his enemies into darkness. What do you plot against Yahweh? He
      will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time. For
      entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed
      utterly like dry stubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to the traditional belief that God will keep His enemies alive
      forever to keep sinning, God will instead make a full end to evil. He will
      pursue His enemies into the depths of Sheol. They will all be completely
      consumed like straw. God will have complete victory over sin and death and
      evil.

    <h2>Malachi 4:1-3</h2>
    <p>
      "'For behold, the day comes, burning like a furnace, when all the proud
      and all who work wickedness will be stubble. The day that comes will burn
      them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them neither root
      nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
      arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and leap like calves of
      the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under
      the soles of your feet in the day that I make,' says Yahweh of Armies."

        "For it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who
        afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us when
        the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming
        fire, punishing those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey
        the Good News of our Lord Jesus, who will pay the penalty: eternal
        destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
        when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be
        admired among all those who have believed, because our testimony to you
        was believed." (2 Thes 1:6-10).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      God's destruction of the wicked will be complete. There will be no part
      left untouched by the burning furnace and no part left unconsumed. They
      will be like "natural animals to be taken and destroyed" and "will in
      their destroying surely be destroyed" (2 Pet 2:12). Only the righteous
      will arise to healing and life. All those who work wickedness will rise to
      judgment and be burned up with unquenchable fire so that only ashes
      remain.

        >The Meaning of "Apollumi" in the Synoptic Gospels</a
      >, 2012: "the term apollumi ['destroy']... always refers to the literal
      killing of a person... Some claims in biblical interpretation are matters
      of opinion and open to question, but this is not one of them... However
      theologically inconvenient it may be for defenders of the traditional
      doctrine of the eternal torments of hell, this is an instance where the
      exegetical evidence is very heavily against them, and there is no apparent
      escape route via an appeal to semantics."

    <h2>Matthew 10:15 // 11:24 // Luke 12:47-48</h2>
    <p>
      "Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of
      Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that it is a day of judgment that is said to be worse. It does not
      say that they will experience an everlasting time of greater misery.
      Whatever way degrees of punishment are worked out for each person, God's
      justice demands that the ultimate end of the unsaved is death. Other than
      the duration, type, and amount suffering that takes place, part of the
      justice may be the way they are remembered. The wicked in general will be
      remembered with "everlasting contempt" (Dan 12:2) and "disgust" (Isa
      66:24), but mass murders will be remembered with greater disdain than
      liars.

      >, 2016: "Hence, I reject the traditional teaching of perpetual conscious
      torment as simply not taught in scripture and plainly unjust as, under the
      tradition interpretation... [people] with very few sins, suffer the same
      fate as the greatest sinners in history. The NT routinely describes the
      fate of the damned as 'death' or 'destruction,' which words are the very
      opposite of 'don’t die' and 'aren’t destroyed' — which is the traditional
      teaching."

        "But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a
        cause will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother,
        ‘Raca!’ will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will
        be in danger of the fire of Gehenna" (Mat 5:22).

        "If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away

        >Matthew 10:28 is About God, Not the Devil</a
      >, 2022: "The context of Matthew 10:28 is one of the most key factors in
      interpreting it. This is not just generically speaking of destroying.
      Whereas John 10:10 just broadly says the enemy seeks to 'destroy,' Jesus’s
      words in Matthew get much more specific. Jesus is speaking of hell (Greek
      <em>gehenna</em>), the place of final punishment."
    </p>

    <h2>Matthew 18:8 // 25:41 // Jude 7</h2>
    <p>
      "If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it
      from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled,
      rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal
      fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next verse says, "If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out
      and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one
      eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire" (Mat
      18:9). The parallel of "eternal fire" with "Gehenna of fire" indicates
      that they are referring to the same fate. The Gehenna of fire is where
      God's enemies go to die. Gehenna is The Valley of Slaughter. It's a
      picture of God's enemies being slain, and the dead bodies are utterly
      consumed by scavengers and fire. Jeremiah 19:6-11 says:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no
        more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but
        ‘The valley of Slaughter’... I will cause them to fall by the sword
        before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I
        will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for
        the animals of the earth... Even so I will break this people and this
        city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again.
        They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.”

      Jude tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah "are shown as an example, suffering
      the punishment of eternal fire" (Jude 1:7). The complete destruction of
      Sodom and Gomorrah functions typologically to show the outcome of the
      unrighteous. The eternal fire represents complete destruction:

      7:13-14; 10:28; 13:24-30, 36-43; 18:8-9). Consistent with this message,
      Jesus here says only the righteous will be granted eternal life...

      the famous fire-and-brimstone traditionalist, argued that Sodom and
      Gomorrah both suffered 'eternal fire' and 'eternal destruction' because
      they were destroyed and are to never be rebuilt... he grants all the
      points sufficient for the annihilationist here. Sodom and Gomorrah
      themselves suffered the vengeance of 'eternal fire' in the eternal
      destruction of those cities, i.e by being destroyed and never coming back,
      not by their inhabitants being in a state of burning for eternity." "The
      one time where it is clear what eternal fire actually does, it refers to a
      fire that destroys everything and does not burn anyone forever. It speaks
      volumes that a number of passages used to demonstrate the truth of the
      eternal torment doctrine actually go against that view once they are
      properly understood."

      From the very beginning of the Bible, the punishment for sins has always
      been death while the reward for obedience is eternal life. Even though all
      still face bodily death, Jesus emphasizes that the second death is
      complete and eternal. The wicked will not receive atonement for their sins
      based on the obedience of Christ, but will instead face the wrath of God
      who will destroy soul and body and cast into Gehenna.

        “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall

        Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says
        Yahweh. “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who
        have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will
        their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind” (Isa

      Matthew, Isaiah, and Daniel indicate that life everlasting is reserved for
      the righteous only. Daniel tells us that the unrighteous will feel shame
      when they rise, but he doesn't say they will feel shame forever. Daniel
      and Isaiah both indicate that the unrighteous will be held in contempt
      forever by the righteous, but this does not require the unrighteous to be
      alive. The only punishment with an eternal duration that is consistent
      with these facts is death. Isaiah says that in the new heavens and new
      earth, the unrighteous will be dead bodies that are eaten by worms and
      utterly consumed by fire. This confirms that death, the privation of life,
      is the punishment for the unrighteous.

        >City of God</a
      >, translated by Marcus Dods: "Cicero tells us that the laws recognize
      eight kinds of penalty,—damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,
      disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may be
      compressed into a brevity proportioned to the rapid commission of the
      offence, so that no longer time may be spent in its punishment than in its
      perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation?... What shall we say of
      imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only for so long a time as he
      spent on the offence for which he is committed?... And as to damages,
      disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly inflicted so as to admit of
      no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble eternal punishments in so
      far as this short life allows a resemblance? For they are not eternal only
      because the life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the
      crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings are
      perpetrated in a very brief space of time..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon the
      punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is inflicted, or
      in this, that the offender is eternally banished from the society of the
      living? And just as the punishment of the first death cuts men off from
      this present mortal city, so does the punishment of the second death cut
      men off from that future immortal city. For as the laws of this present
      city do not provide for the executed criminal’s return to it, so neither
      is he who is condemned to the second death recalled again to life
      everlasting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if temporal sin is visited with eternal punishment, how, then, they
      say, is that true which your Christ says, 'With the same measure that ye
      mete withal it shall be measured to you again?' and they do not observe
      that 'the same measure' refers, not to an equal space of time, but to the
      retribution of evil or, in other words, to the law by which he who has
      done evil suffers evil. Besides, these words could be appropriately
      understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord was speaking when
      He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who unjustly
      judges and condemns is himself justly judged and condemned, he receives
      'with the same measure' though not the same thing as he gave. For judgment
      he gave, and judgment he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust,
      the judgment he receives just."

      literature in Eternal Punishment in First-Century Jewish Thought, he
      concludes, "This means the verse stating that 'punishment' is eternal
      should be understood to mean that torment plus destruction is
      eternal—without any means of escape—because this is what his
      contemporaries meant when they used the same language."

      eternal... The same is true for 'eternal redemption,' Christ does not go
      on forever redeeming, but the result of his once for all act of redemption
      is eternal (Heb 9:12). When it comes to 'eternal punishment' (Matt 25:46)
      and 'eternal destruction' (2 Thess 1:9), where 'eternal' modifies an
      action, it seems plausible to suggest that the punishing and destruction
      do not go on forever, but that there is an act of punishment/destruction

    <h2>Mark 9:47-48 // Matthew 5:22 // Isaiah 66:24</h2>
    <p>
      "...cast into the Gehenna of fire, 'where their worm doesn’t die, and the
      fire is not quenched.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gehenna, shorthand for "The valley of Hinnom," is a place filled with
      unburied corpses that are eaten by scavengers and burned by fire:
    </p>
    <section>
      “Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more be
      called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of
      Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
      The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and
      for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away. Then I will
      cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem
      the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom
      and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.” (Jer
      7:32-42).
    </section>

    <p>
      Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 where it clearly states that corpses are being
      consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of the
      unburied corpses, worm and fire in Isaiah is not about eternal conscious
      torment but emphasizes the shame and complete destruction of the wicked:
    </p>
    <section>
      “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
      before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall remain. It
      shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to
      another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh. “They
      will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed
      against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched,
      and they will be loathsome to all mankind.” (Isa 66:22-24).
    </section>
    <p>
      The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never die" in
      other biblical contexts (e.g., Gen 42:20, Ex 30:20, Jer 38:24). It often
      means "will not die at a particular time or in a particular context." In
      Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms will not die before completely
      devouring the corpses. That is especially clear when it is connected with
      Gehenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that burns
      forever. "Quench" means "extinguish." The fire in Isaiah cannot be
      extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This imagery emphasizes the
      complete and irreversible nature of the consumption.

      9:48, they explain the context of Isa. 66:24: "By way of invitation, they
      lay out two eternal destinies: participation in the expansive vision of
      all flesh coming to worship Yahweh (66:23; cf. 2:1-5) over against, not
      unlike Mal. 4:4-6, a final, chilling picture of the corpses of the rebels,
      'whose worm will not die, and whose fire will not be quenched.'"

        >Introduction to Evangelical Conditionalism – Mark 9:48</a
      >, 2018. Dear provides two arguments against the traditional
      interpretation: "1. The Old Testament background of the passage paints a
      very different picture from the idea of conscious, resurrected people
      alive in a place of fire and biting worms (or their symbolic equivalent)
      forever. 2. The terms used about worms not dying and fire not being
      quenched don’t even mean eternal duration in the first place. That part is
      read into the passage by people who already believe that hell is a place
      of eternal torment."

      the righteous will come out "to the resurrection of life" (Jn 5:29). The
      unrighteous will awake to "shame" while the righteous will rise to
      "everlasting life" (Dan 12:2). The consistent contrast of judgment with
      life reflects the fact that it will not include life. "Only one is the

        "This is the second death, the lake of fire. If anyone was not found
        written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire." (Rev
        20:14-15).

    <p>
      The first death refers to physical death. Man can physically kill you, but
      your spirit lives on. The second death refers to spiritual death, death of
      body and soul. Only God can finally put someone to death in that ultimate
      way.

    <h2>1 Corinthians 15:23-26</h2>
    <p>
      "But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are
      Christ’s at his coming. Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the
      Kingdom to God the Father, when he will have abolished all rule and all
      authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies
      under his feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument has been made that because death is "swallowed up in victory"
      when the dead are raised, everyone must raised be immortal. This flies in
      the face of Revelation 20:14 in which God's enemies suffer the second
      death on judgment day. If all death is destroyed, then there can be no
      eternal punishment and all must be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this misses the distinction between the first and second death.
      The traditionalist interprets the first death as separation of soul from
      body and the second death as separation of soul and body from God. The
      conditionalist interprets the first death as death of body and the second
      death as death of soul and body. It follows that 1 Corinthians 15:26 is
      only about the abolishment of the first death so the unrighteous will
      still face the second death or else one must deny the second death and
      therefore deny eternal punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also not necessary to see the chronology this way. It is reasonable
      to assume that God could destroy the last enemy at the second coming when
      the dead are raised, the saints are made immortal, and God's enemies are
      judged. When the last enemy is defeated, God's enemies are gone and no
      more death will take place. Then death will have been defeated. After all,
      these events are all happening on judgment day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also be noted that God's enemies and death suffer the same fate
      of the second death in the lake of fire. We know that death is abolished,
      destroyed, and annihilated, so God's enemies will be abolished, destroyed,
      and annihilated.

    <h2>Philippians 3:19 // 1:28</h2>

    <h2>2 Thessalonians 1:9 // 2:8</h2>
    <p>
      "who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord

    </p>
    <p>
      Verses 7-8 provide important context: "when the Lord Jesus is revealed
      from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, punishing those who
      don’t know God." This is a clear reference to Isaiah 66:15: "For, behold,
      Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the whirlwind;
      to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire."
      It goes on to say, "For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his
      sword on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many." (Isa 66:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Eternal indicates that this desctruction will never be reversed. The
      unrighteous will be eternally destroyed. Whether this destruction arises
      directly from an act of the Lord as this verse seems to indicate, or
      whether it stems from a definitive and complete separatin from God, the
      fountain of life, the outcome is the same; the result is that "Yahweh will
      execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh; and those slain by
      Yahweh will be many... They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of
      the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor
      will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
      (Isa 66:16, 24).

      The flood which destroyed the whole world and killed everyone in it except
      Noah and his family is given as an example of the final judgment. God
      destroys sinners and annihilates their way of life. In the traditional
      view, God makes sinners immortal and allows them to sin for eternity. In
      the conditionalist view, sinners and all of their works of wickness will
      be destroyed and perish. God puts a full end to sin and evil.

    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>Hermeneutic</h2>
    <p>If we recognize the following principles, we shouldn't go far astray:</p>
    <p>
      1. John is describing a symbolic vision, not a direct picture of the
      future. The vision is made up of symbols that represent reality but which
      need interpretation. He is not giving a direct, literal description of
      reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. John uses Old Testament language to describe the vision he sees. We
      need to understand the Old Testament allusions in context to properly
      understand John's intended meaning. Intertestamental literature like the
      Jewish targums and the Greco-Roman background of Revelation also help
      inform our understanding of the language John uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. John develops certain themes throughout the book of Revelation, so
      comparing related passages with each other helps to elucidate the meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Some of the symbolic pictures in Revelation are given direct
      interpretations in which case the referent is immediately known. The
      interpretation of a symbol is not symbolic itself, but is the literal,
      direct, or straightforward meaning of the symbol.

      Brian J. Tabb, All Things New: Revelation as Canonical Capstone, vol. 48,
      New Studies in Biblical Theology (Downers Grove: IVP, 2019), 8: "Like
      Jesus and the Old Testament prophets, Revelation presents its message in
      symbolic, pictorial language to unveil true spiritual realities
      compellingly to those with ears to hear... Jesus Christ ‘made known’ or
      ‘signified’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) the revelation to John by sending an angel
      (Rev. 1:1). Similarly, Daniel 2:30, 45 LXX says that the mystery of the
      king’s dream ‘was shown’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) to Daniel and ‘the great God
      has shown [<em>sēmainō</em>] the king what will be at the end of the days’

      important to recognize that the descriptions

      Dennis E. Johnson, Triumph of the Lamb: A Commentary on Revelation
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2001), 4, 11, 13, 22: "Although, as we
      will see, applying the literal-where-possible maxim to prophetic
      literature is problematic, its inadequacy does not mean that Revelation is
      a wax nose, to be manipulated into any shape we choose... The literal
      meaning of symbolic language is the symbolic correspondence between the
      imagery of the language and the referent that it describes... We dare not
      tackle the symbolism of Revelation without immersing our minds in the rich
      imagery of the Old Testament... Revelation makes sense only in light of
      the Old Testament. Not only the visions of such prophets as Ezekiel,
      Daniel, and Zechariah but also historical events such as creation, the
      fall, and the exodus provide the symbolic vocabulary for John’s visions."

      revelation is not abstract but pictorial... Dan. 2:28-30, 45 indicates
      that a symbolic vision and its interpretation is going to be part of the
      warp and woof of the means of communication throughout Revelation. This
      conclusion is based on the supposition that John uses OT references with
      significant degrees of awareness of OT context, for which I will argue
      later... [A] number of authors of both popular and scholarly commentaries
      contend that one should interpret literally except where one is forced to
      interpret symbolically by clear indications of context... But the results
      of the analysis above of 1:1 indicate that... the essence of the book is
      figurative ['1:12-20 and 4:1-22:5 at the least']... The OT and Judaism are

      Old Testament in a careful and not haphazard way throughout, so that an
      understanding of these Old Testament texts is crucial to the
      interpretation of the Apocalypse at every point along the way and is
      necessary for understanding his literary strategy. Consequently, the Old
      Testament 'forms a body of literature which John expects his readers to
      know and explicitly to recall in detail while reading his own work'.
      Furthermore, a study of Jewish exegetical tradition of various Old
      Testament texts can also shed light on John's own understanding of the
      same texts."

      ['the verb cognate of the noun “sign” in john’s Gospel']... in 1:1 because
      of its parallels with Dan. 2:28-30, 45, where God 'signifies' truths
      through pictorial or symbolic visions. Thus it means to 'communicate by
      symbols' and connotes the need to interpret the reality behind the
      symbol... Symbols are metaphorical utterances that are meant to be
      understood first pictorially and then referentially... The sources for
      interpreting them come from the OT, intertestamental literature, and the
      Greco-Roman world—in other words, in the common world of the original

      Richard Bauckham, Climax of Prophecy, (Edinburgh: T&T, 1993), xi: "It is a
      book designed to be read in constant intertextual relationship with the
      Old Testament. John was writing what he understood to be a work of
      prophetic scripture, the climax of prophetic revelation, which gathered up
      the prophetic meaning of the Old Testament scriptures and disclosed the
      way in which it was being and was to be fulfilled in the last days. His
      work therefore, presupposes and conveys an extensive interpretation of
      large parts of Old Testament prophecy. Allusions are meant to recall the
      Old Testament context, which thereby becomes part of the meaning the
      Apocalypse conveys, and to build up, sometimes by a network of allusion to
      the same Old Testament passage in various parts of the Apocalypse, an
      interpretation of whole passages of Old Testament prophecy."

      Vern S. Poythress, The Returning King (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing,

      'Interpret everything literally, if possible.' That recipe misunderstands
      what kind of book Revelation is. Of course, John literally saw what he
      says he saw. But what he saw was a vision. It was filled with symbols,
      like the Beast of 13:1–8 and the seven blazing lamps in 4:5. It never
      intended to be a direct, nonsymbolical description of the future. People
      living in John’s own time understood this matter instinctively, because
      they recognized that John was writing in an 'apocalyptic' manner, a manner
      already as familiar to them as a political cartoon is to us today."

      to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as
      well as to the saints and those who fear your name, to the small and the

        >Judgment in the Book Of Revelation</a
      >, 2: "The correspondence of crime and punishment here depends on a
      wordplay, exploiting the double meaning of <em>diaphtheirō</em>, which can
      mean both “destroy,” in the sense of causing to perish, and “ruin,” in the
      sense of corrupting with evil. The destroyers of the earth are the powers
      of evil who are ruining God’s creation with their violence, oppression,
      and idolatrous religion (cf. 19:2). There is an allusion to the equivalent
      wordplay in the Genesis story of the flood (Gen 6:11–13, 17, where s-h-t
      has the same double meaning). In both cases God’s wholesale destruction of
      those who are ruining his creation is justified as necessary for the
      preservation of his creation and its salvation from the evil they are
      doing to it."
    </p>

    <h2>Revelation 14:9-11</h2>
    <p>
      "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
      anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
      forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of
      God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
      tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in
      the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and
      ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his
      image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Old Testament, the cup of God's wrath is a potent symbol of divine
      judgment, sometimes temporary and recoverable, while at other times
      irreversible and destructive (Isa 51:22-52:2; Obad 16; Jer 25:27). Jesus,
      representing humanity, took upon himself the wrathful cup, enduring death
      (Matt 26:39, 42, 44). His death and resurrection mean that his followers
      no longer face this wrath, instead receiving a cup of blessing (Matt
      26:27-29). Revelation portrays the cup as a judgment against "Babylon,"
      the epitome of evil, leading to its inevitable destruction (Rev 16:19;
      18:6, 7-9). It affects all those allied with the beast (Rev 17–19), and
      symbolizes a final, fatal judgment, leading to utter destruction
      characterized by torment, grief, famine, and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
      Gomorrah (Gen 19:23, 28; Deut 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isa 30:27-33; 34:9-11;
      Ezek 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive annihilation and complete
      destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake. This picture appears
      to be in stark contrast to excruciating, unending suffering.
    </p>
    <section>
      "He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
      plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a
      furnace" (Gen 19:28).
    </section>
    <p>
      Smoke rising forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the wicked.
      This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was destroyed by
      fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the everlasting nature of
      its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as a permanent reminder of
      God's final victory over evil.
    </p>
    <section>
      "It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From
      generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through it
      forever and ever" (Isa 34:10).
    </section>
    <p>
      John vividly depicts the plight of those who worship the beast,
      emphasizing that they find no respite "day or night." John consistently
      uses "day and night" in Revelation to describe continuous actions,
      unrelated to time of day, such as the living creatures' praise, the
      martyrs' service, Satan's accusations, and the torment of the unholy
      trinity. Similarly, Isaiah 34:10 uses "night and day" to describe Edom's
      unquenched fire, symbolizing complete destruction. While the fire burns
      continuously without ceasing, it will consume completely.

      ceaseless activity... The lack of rest will continue uninterrupted as long
      as the period of suffering lasts, though there will be an end to the
      period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great
      judgment that will be remembered forever, not one that leads to eternal
      suffering."

      destroyed... To the gruesome images of Ezekiel, John adds 'devour her
      flesh,' a reference to the total annihilation of the harlot-city... All
      three elements—betrayal, plagues, parousia—are part of the same sovereign
      plan of God by which he will bring world history with all its depravity to

      <em>torment</em>, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong

      judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual

        >The Book of Revelation</a
      >, (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 929: "what is precisely underscored is
      the finality of Babylon’s judgment: 'her smoke ascends forever.' The
      wording comes from Isa. 34:9-10, where the portrayal of smoke continually
      ascending serves as a permanent memorial to God’s punishment of Edom for
      its sin. Rev. 14:11 also alludes to Isa. 34:9-10 to describe the
      never-ending effect of God’s judgment of the beast’s followers. Here
      Edom’s fall is taken as an anticipatory typological pattern for the fall
      of the world system, which will never rise again after God’s judgment."

    <h2>Revelation 20:10</h2>
    <p>
      "The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur,
      where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day
      and night forever and ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      John couldn't see an eternal process in a vision and the language he uses
      reflects that. "Forever and ever" is figurative and indicates a long
      period of time. John sees the beast, the false prophet, and the devil
      suffering torment for a very long time. John tells us that the "lake of
      fire" is a picture the "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). John is not
      using symbolism to interpret his symbolism. The vision he sees represents
      the final death of the wicked, not everlasting torment. This vision is a
      climatic recapitulation of the judgment portrayed throughout Revelation
      (16:14, 16; 17:14; 19:11-21). Confirming this is the fact that the
      personified figures of Death and Hades are indeed destroyed after they
      were thrown into the lake of fire. Christ's enemies are destroyed, and
      righteousness will reign forevermore.

      'torment and grief,' which turns out to be 'death, mourning, and famine,'
      and she is 'consumed by fire.' It is not unthinkable, therefore, to
      understand torment of the devil, beast, and false prophet as death and
      consumption by fire which are never reversed."

      Hades,' which is a temporary, preconsummate holding tank to be finally
      replaced by the permanent, consummate 'lake of fire,' which is 'the second

      the vision. He could not have seen an eternal, perpetual process. But he
      could have seen a process that clearly lasted for ages and ages. That is
      what he conveyed to his readers."

      would give (in varying forms), is itself simple: John sees a vision where
      three beings are thrown into a lake of fire to be tormented for ever and
      ever, but the vision itself symbolizes the destruction of the things the

      impression given by some—the powerful, graphic and fear-inspiring image of
      the 'lake of fire' is clearly a symbolic reference, for both 'death and
      hades' are thrown into it (Rev. 20:14)... death itself (and the entire
      grave as a general concept) will ultimately be brought to nothing. In the
      end, in the new heavens and new earth where 'righteousness dwells,' death
      and the grave will no longer be."

      makes more sense to see 20:1–15 as the seventh and last cycle of
      judgments, each of which leads up to the Second Coming... The final battle
      in 20:7–10 seems to be the same as the final battle in 16:14, 16; 17:14;
      19:11–21... Most importantly, all of Christ’s enemies are destroyed in
      19:11–21. If 20:1–6 describes events later than 19:11–21, there would be
      no one left for Satan to deceive in 20:3."

      death: "Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying,
      nor pain any more. The first things have passed away" (Rev 21:4). Paul

      to talk about a permanent dying in the world to come. Almost all pre-NT
      Jewish texts reflect a conditionalist belief in keeping with the Old
      Testament. After that time, some Jewish texts seem to reflect a belief in
      eternal concious torment, but they are the minority. 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch
      are examples, and these are later works. Nearly all of the Qumran
      literature clearly reflects belief in the eschatological annihilation of
      the wicked. Examples include the Psalms of Solomon and the Wisdom of
      Solomon.

        >Traditionalism and the (Not So) Second Death</a
      >: "Putting aside the rather awkward definition of death as torment, this
      line of reasoning suffers from still another problem. Those over whom John
      says the second death will have no power are those who come to life and
      reign with Christ (20:4-6). Those who are not thrown into the lake of
      fire—the second death—are first raised out of death and Hades (20:13-15).
      The first death, then, is something experienced by both believers and
      unbelievers alike; both are raised from it, and only the unsaved
      experience the second. Therefore, if what qualifies the second death as
      the <em>second</em> death is the torment in which it consists, and in
      which the first death likewise consists, then it follows that believers,
      too, experience torment in Hades prior to the resurrection."

      vision of people dying a second time and was then told that 'the second
      death is the lake of fire'. Traditionalists then take this strange
      definition of death and apply it to other verses like Romans 6:23... They
      say that 'death' does not mean what we normally think of as 'death'.
      Indeed, the traditional view is that the unsaved NEVER actually die.
      Instead they live forever in the lake of fire. Hopefully by now you can

        >Against the Heathen</a
      >: "What is this passion, so bloodthirsty, to declare implacable war on
      one who did not deserve it from you; to want to tear Him limb from limb if
      you could, who not only brought evil to no man, but spoke with equal
      kindness to enemies concerning the salvation that was being brought to
      them from God the Ruler; concerning what had to be done so that they might
      escape death and receive an immortality unknown to them? And when the
      strangeness of these things and the unheard promises troubled the minds of
      those who heard them and caused them to hesitate to believe, the Lord of
      every power and the Destroyer of death itself, allowed His human form to
      be killed, so that from the results they might know that the hopes which
      they had long entertained about the salvation of the soul were safe and

      "For they are cast in, and being annihilated, pass away vainly in

      learned from Christ's teaching; and they are such that they may on the one
      hand perish if they have not known God, and on the other be delivered from
      death if they have given heed to His threats and proffered favours. And to
      make manifest what is unknown, this is man's real death, this which leaves
      nothing behind. For that which is seen by the eyes is only a separation of
      soul from body, not the last end — annihilation: this, I say, is man's
      real death, when souls which know not God shall be consumed in
      long-protracted torment with raging fire, into which certain fiercely
      cruel beings shall cast them, who were unknown before Christ, and brought

        >On the Incarnation of the Word</a
      >: "For if, out of a former normal state of non-existence, they were
      called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness of the Word, it
      followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge of God and
      were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but what is
      good is), they should, since they derive their being from God who IS, be
      everlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that they should be
      disintegrated and abide in death and corruption. For man is by nature
      mortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not; but by reason of his
      likeness to Him that is (and if he still preserved this likeness by
      keeping Him in his knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption, and
      remain incorrupt" (4.5).
    </p>
    <p>
      "For it were monstrous, firstly, that God, having spoken, should prove
      false — that, when once He had ordained that man, if he transgressed the
      commandment, should die the death, after the transgression man should not
      die, but God's word should be broken. For God would not be true, if, when
      He had said we should die, man died not. Again, it were unseemly that
      creatures once made rational, and having partaken of the Word, should go
      to ruin, and turn again toward non-existence by the way of corruption...
      It was, then, out of the question to leave men to the current of
      corruption; because this would be unseemly, and unworthy of God's
      goodness." (6.3-4, 10).

      creation have been the creation's salvation, as needing salvation itself.
      To provide against this also, He sends His own Son, and He becomes Son of

      His own body; and that henceforth, as if all had died through Him, the

      no previous existence, were called into being, and continue throughout a
      long course of time according to the will of God, so also any one who
      thinks thus respecting souls and spirits, and, in fact, respecting all

      things that have been made had a beginning when they were formed, but
      endure as long as God wills that they should have an existence and

      to the evangelistic work of traditionalists in the western world, might it
      not be, therefore, that an annihilationist understanding would be

    <h2>Eternal Death</h2>
    <p>
      The language of conditional immortality flows straight from the Bible and
      has been widely used by those who hold to the traditional view of hell who
      would frankly admit that they are just parroting the clear teaching of
      Scripture. The phrase "eternal death" exemplifies annihilation language
      and is frequently contrasted with "eternal life" conditioned on faith in
      Christ, the conditional aspect of conditional immortality, providing the
      two sides of conditional immortality. But this language clearly undermines
      and betrays their position on hell; for they hold that an embodied life of
      suffering is the punishment for sin, not death forever. That is why the
      word "death" is equivocated on and reinterpreted to mean separation
      instead of the loss of life.

      have not provoked him by any previous offense; for to devote to
      destruction whomsoever he pleases, more resembles the caprice of a tyrant
      than the legal sentence of a judge; and, therefore, there is reason to
      expostulate with God, if at his mere pleasure men are, without any desert
      of their own, predestinated to eternal death... Scripture proclaims that
      all were, in the person of one, made liable to eternal death."

        >Does the Character of God Require Him to Subject the Unrighteous to
        Eternal Conscious Torment?</a
      >, 2022: "Philosophical arguments and the views of other Christians can be
      either right or wrong, but they should never be used to overthrow the
      clear and direct teaching of the Bible. And the Bible clearly teaches that
      the final fate of the unrighteous is for God to destroy their bodies and
      souls in hell (Matthew 10:28), for them to perish (John 3:16), and for
      them to be turned to ashes (2 Peter 2:6)."

        >Hell is Payback</a
      >, 2017: "If unrighteous people really did deserve to be tortured for
      eternity then how does God ever fulfill His promise to repay sinners? If
      the unrighteous “owe” an eternity of suffering as payment for their sins,
      then even after a million trillion years of torment they would have repaid
      far less than 1/1000th of 1% of the debt they apparently owe. In this view
      justice is NEVER complete or fulfilled."

        >Does Annihilationism Make the Threat of Hell Meaningless?</a
      >, 2017: "The objection that the punishment is not severe just does not
      pass the reality test. Imagine you had a friend who you knew was about to
      be captured by North Korea, imprisoned and tortured for an unknown length
      of time, and then executed. Would you say, 'Oh, that’s no big deal!'? And
      yet the annihilation of the wicked is much more severe because it will
      last forever!"
