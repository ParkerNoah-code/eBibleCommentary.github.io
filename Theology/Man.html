  <h2>Chapter 6. Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof</h2>
  <p>
    <b>1.</b> Although God created man upright and perfect, and gave him a
    righteous law, which had been unto life had he kept it, and threatened death
    upon the breach thereof,<sup>1</sup> yet he did not long abide in this
    honor; Satan using the subtlety of the serpent to subdue Eve, then by her
    seducing Adam, who, without any compulsion, did willfully transgress the law
    of their creation, and the command given to them, in eating the forbidden
    fruit,<sup>2</sup> which God was pleased, according to His wise and holy
    counsel to permit, having purposed to order it to His own glory.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Genesis 2:16-17<br />
    2. Genesis 3:12-13; 2 Corinthians 11:3
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>2.</b> Our first parents, by this sin, fell from their original
    righteousness and communion with God, and we in them whereby death came upon
    all:<sup>3</sup> all becoming dead in sin,<sup>4</sup> and wholly defiled in
    all the faculties and parts of soul and body.<sup>5</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Romans 3:23<br />
    4. Romans 5:12, etc.<br />
    5. Titus 1:15; Genesis 6:5; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 3:10-19
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3.</b> They being the root, and by God's appointment, standing in the
    room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of the sin was imputed, and
    corrupted nature conveyed, to all their posterity descending from them by
    ordinary generation,<sup>6</sup> being now conceived in sin,<sup>7</sup> and
    by nature children of wrath,<sup>8</sup> the servants of sin, the subjects
    of death,<sup>9</sup> and all other miseries, spiritual, temporal, and
    eternal, unless the Lord Jesus set them free.<sup>10</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Romans 5:12-19; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 45, 49<br />
    7. Psalms 51:5; Job 14:4<br />
    8. Ephesians 2:3<br />
    9. Romans 6:20, 5:12<br />
    10. Hebrews 2:14-15; 1 Thessalonians 1:10
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.</b> From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed,
    disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all
    evil,<sup>11</sup> do proceed all actual transgressions.<sup>12</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    11. Romans 8:7; Colossians 1:21<br />
    12. James 1:14-15; Matthew 15:19
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.</b> The corruption of nature, during this life, does remain in those
    that are regenerated;<sup>13</sup> and although it be through Christ
    pardoned and mortified, yet both itself, and the first motions thereof, are
    truly and properly sin.<sup>14</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    13. Romans 7:18, 23; Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8<br />
    14. Romans 7:23-25; Galatians 5:17<br />
  </p>
  <h2>Chapter 9. Of Free Will</h2>
  <p>
    <b>1.</b> God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty and power
    of acting upon choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any necessity of
    nature determined to do good or evil.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>1. Matthew 17:12; James 1:14; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
  <p>
    <b>2.</b> Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and
    to do that which was good and well-pleasing to God,<sup>2</sup> but yet was
    unstable, so that he might fall from it.<sup>3</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Ecclesiastes 7:29<br />
    3. Genesis 3:6
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3.</b> Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability
    of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation;<sup>4</sup> so as a
    natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin,<sup
      >5</sup
    >
    is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself
    thereunto.<sup>6</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Romans 5:6, 8:7<br />
    5. Ephesians 2:1, 5<br />
    6. Titus 3:3-5; John 6:44
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.</b> When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of
    grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin,<sup>7</sup> and by
    His grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is
    spiritually good;<sup>8</sup> yet so as that by reason of his remaining
    corruptions, he does not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good, but
    does also will that which is evil.<sup>9</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Colossians 1:13; John 8:36<br />
    8. Philippians 2:13<br />
    9. Romans 7:15, 18-19, 21, 23
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.</b> This will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good
    alone in the state of glory only.<sup>10</sup>
  </p>
  <p>10. Ephesians 4:13</p>
