    <h2>Chapter 8. Of Christ the Mediator</h2>

    <p>
      <b>9. Jesus is the Only Savior and Mediator</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This office of mediator between God and man is proper only to Christ, who
      is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God; and may not be
      either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from Him to any
      other.<sup>43</sup>
    </p>
    <p>43. 1 Timothy 2:5</p>
    <p>
      <b>10. The Threefold Office: Prophet, Priest, King</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our
      ignorance, we stand in need of His prophetical office;<sup>44</sup> and in
      respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best of our
      services, we need His priestly office to reconcile us and present us
      acceptable unto God;<sup>45</sup> and in respect to our averseness and
      utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security from our
      spiritual adversaries, we need His kingly office to convince, subdue,
      draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to His heavenly kingdom.<sup
