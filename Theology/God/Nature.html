      >Body of Doctrinal Divinity</a
    >, Chapter 4. Of the Nature of God:
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a nature that belongs to every creature, which is difficult to
    understand; and so to God, the Creator, which is most difficult of all: that
    &quot;Nature&quot; may be predicated of God, is what the apostle suggests
    when he says, the Galatians, before conversion, served them, who, &quot;by
    nature, were no gods&quot;, (Galatians 4:8) which implies, that though the
    idols they had worshiped were not, yet there was one that was, by Nature,
    GOD; otherwise there would be an impropriety in denying it of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mention is also made of the &quot;divine Nature&quot;, (2 Peter 1:4) which,
    indeed, is not the nature that is in God, but what is infused and implanted
    in men in regeneration; so called, not only because it is from God, as its
    author, but because it is the image of him, and bears a likeness and
    resemblance to him; but then there must be a nature in him to which this is
    similar, being &quot;created, after him, in righteousness and true
    holiness&quot;; or there would be no propriety in the denomination of it
    from him. This is what is called Divinity, Deity, or Godhead; which must not
    be thought to be &quot;like to gold, silver, or stone, graven by are, or
    man&#x27;s device&quot;; or to be in the similitude of any creature, in a
    picture, painting, or sculpture; and which is to be seen and understood by
    the visible works of creation, and is what, &quot;in all its perfection and
    fullness, dwells bodily in Christ&quot;, (Acts 17:29; Romans 1:20; Col 2:9).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the same with the form of God, in which Christ is said to be,
    (Philippians 2:6) which designs not any external form, for God has no
    visible shape, but his internal Glory, excellency, nature, and perfections,
    in which &quot;Christ is equal with him, and his fellow&quot;; and he is not
    only the express image of him, but one with him; not merely of a like, but
    of the same nature; so that he who sees the one, sees the other.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essence, which is the same thing with nature, is ascribed to God; he is said
    to be &quot;excellent hyvwt in essence&quot;, (Isaiah 28:29) for so the
    words may be rendered, that is, he has the most excellent essence or being;
    this is contained in his names, &quot;Jehovah&quot;, and &quot;I am that I
    am&quot;, which are expressive of his essence or being, as has been
    observed; and we are required to believe that he is, that he has a being or
    essence, and does exist, (Hebrews 11:6) and essence is that by which a
    person or thing is what it is, that is its nature; and with respect to God,
    it is the same with his &quot;face&quot;, which cannot be seen, (Exodus
    33:20, 23) that is, cannot be perceived, understood, and fully comprehended,
    especially in the present state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though in the future state saints will behold the face of God, and &quot;see
    him face to face, and as he is&quot;, so far as they are capable of, yet it
    is impossible for a finite mind, in its most exalted state, to comprehend
    the infinite Nature and Being of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    This nature is common to the three Persons in God, but not communicated from
    one to another; they each of them partake of it, and possess it as one
    undivided nature; they all enjoy it; it is not a part of it that is enjoyed
    by one, and a part of it by another, but the whole by each; as &quot;all the
    fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ&quot;, so in the holy Spirit; and
    of the Father, there will be no doubt; these equally exist in the unity of
    the divine essence, and that without any derivation or communication of it
    from one to another.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know it is represented by some, who, otherwise, are sound in the doctrine
    of the Trinity, that the divine nature is communicated from the Father to
    the Son and Spirit, and that he is &quot;fons Deitatis&quot;, &quot;the
    fountain of Deity&quot;; which, I think, are unsafe phrases; since they seem
    to imply a priority in the Father to the other two persons; for he who
    communicates must, at least in order of nature, and according to our
    conception of things, be prior to whom the communication is made; and that
    he has a superabundant plenitude of Deity in him, previous to this
    communication. It is better to say, that they are self-existent, and exist
    together in the same undivided essence; and jointly, equally, and as early
    one as the other, possess the same nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    The nature of God is, indeed, incomprehensible by us; somewhat of it may be
    apprehended, but it cannot be fully comprehended; &quot;Can you by searching
    find out God? Can you find out the Almighty unto perfection?&quot; (Job
    11:7). No: but then this does not forbid us searching and inquiring after
    him: though we cannot have adequate ideas of God, yet we should endeavor to
    get the best we can, and frame the best conceptions of him we are able; that
    so we may serve and worship him, honor and glorify him, in the best manner.
    &quot;The world&quot;, the heathen world, even the wisest in it, &quot;by
    wisdom knew not God&quot;, (1 Corinthians 1:21) they knew, or might know,
    there was a God, but they did not know what he was, and so glorified him not
    as God.
  </p>
  <p>
    An heathen philosopher being asked this question, what God was? required a
    day to think of it; when that was up, he asked a second, and still more
    time; and a reason of his dilatoriness being demanded of him, he replied,
    that the longer he considered of the question, the more obscure it was to
    him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, somewhat of God, of his nature and perfections, may be known by the
    light of nature, (Romans 1:19, 20) and more by divine revelation; for though
    it may with propriety be said, &quot;what is his name&quot;, or nature,
    &quot;if you can, tell?&quot; (Proverbs 30:4) yet he whom the heathens
    &quot;ignorantly worshiped&quot;, the apostle Paul &quot;declared&quot; unto
    them, (Acts 17:23) and though the Samaritans worshiped they knew not what,
    yet Christ declared to the woman of Samaria, what God, the object of
    spiritual worship, is; saying &quot;God is a spirit&quot;; that is, he is of
    a spiritual nature, (John 4:22, 24) and this we may be sure is a true
    definition, description, and declaration of God, and of his nature; since
    this was given by the Son of God, who lay in his bosom, and perfectly knew
    his nature, as well as his will; see (John 1:18; Matthew 11:27) and by which
    we are taught,
  </p>
  <p>
    1. That God is not a body, and that we are, in our conceptions of him, to
    remove everything from him that is corporeal; for spirit, and body or flesh,
    are opposed to one another, (Isaiah 31:3; Luke 24:39) and yet there have
    been some, both ancients and moderns, atheistically inclined, who have
    asserted, that matter is God, and God is universal matter; and that the
    whole universe is God, and that extension is one of his attributes: and a
    sort of people called Anthropomorphites, who bore the Christian name,
    ascribed an human body, and the parts of it, to God, in a proper sense,
    mistaking some passages of scripture; and the common people, among the
    papists, have no other notion of God, than of a grave old man: in this
    respect both Jews and Heathens have better notions; of the Jews, R. Joseph
    Albo, Maimonides, and others, deny that God is a body, or consists of bodily
    parts: and of heathens, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, Sallustius, and others,
    affirm God to be incorporeal; and the Stoics say, he has not an human forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if God was matter, which is inert, inactive, and motionless, he could
    not be the maker and mover of all things, as he is; &quot;for in him we
    live, and move, and have our being&quot;, (Acts 17:28). Matter is without
    consciousness, is not capable of thinking, and without understanding,
    wisdom, and knowledge; and as it is not capable of acting, so much less of
    doing, such works as require contrivance, skill, wisdom, and knowledge, as
    the works of creation and providence; and therefore if God was matter, he
    could not be the Creator and Governor of the world; nor if a body, could he
    be omnipresent; a body is not everywhere, cannot be in two places at the
    same time; whereas God fills Heaven and earth: and was he of so huge a body
    as to take up all space, there would be no room for other bodies, as there
    certainly is; nor would he be invisible; a body is to be seen and felt; but
    God is invisible and impalpable; &quot;no man has seen God at any
    time&quot;; and if a body, he would not be the most perfect of beings, as he
    is, since angels, and the souls of men, being spirits, are more excellent
    than bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is no objection to this, that the parts of an human body are sometimes
    attributed to God; since these are to be understood of him not in a proper,
    but in an improper and figurative sense, and denote some act and action, or
    attribute of his; thus his face denotes his sight and presence, in which all
    things are, (Genesis 19:13) sometimes his favor and good will, and the
    manifestation of his love and grace, (Psalm 27:8, 80:3) and sometimes his
    wrath and indignation against wicked men, (Psalm 34:16; Revelation 6:17).
  </p>
  <p>
    His &quot;eyes&quot; signify his omniscience and all-seeing providence;
    concerned both with good men, to protect and preserve them, and bestow good
    things on them; and with bad men, to destroy them, (Proverbs 15:3; 2
    Chronicles 16:9; Amos 9:8). His &quot;ears&quot;, his readiness to attend
    unto, and answer the requests of his people, and deliver them out of their
    troubles, (Psalm 34:15; Isaiah 59:1).
  </p>
  <p>
    His nose and nostrils, his acceptance of the persons and sacrifices of men,
    (Genesis 8:21) or his disgust at them, anger with them, and non-acceptance
    of them, (Deuteronomy 29:20; Isaiah 65:5; Psalm 18:8). His mouth is
    expressive of his commands, promises, threatenings, and prophecies delivered
    out by him, (Lamentations 3:29; Isaiah 1:20; Jeremiah 23:16). His
    &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;hands&quot; signify his power, and the exertion
    of it, as in making the heavens and the earth, and in other actions of his,
    (Psalm 102:27; Job 26:13; Psalm 89:13, 118:16; Deuteronomy 33:27).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor is it any proof of corporeity in God, that a divine person has sometimes
    appeared in an human form; so one of the men that came to Abraham, in the
    plains of Mamre, was no other than the Lord omniscient and omnipotent, as
    the after discourse with him shows, (Genesis 18:3). And the man that
    wrestled with Jacob until break of day, was a divine person, of which Jacob
    was sensible; and therefore called the place where he wrestled with him,
    &quot;Peniel&quot;, the face of God, (Genesis 32:24, 30). So he who appeared
    to Manoah, and his wife, (Judg. 13:6, 10, 18) with other instances that
    might be mentioned.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then these were appearances of the Son of God in an human form, and were
    presages of his future incarnation; for as for the Father, no man ever saw
    his shape, (John 5:37) and, it may be, the reason why the parts of an human
    body are so often ascribed to God, may be on account of Christ&#x27;s
    incarnation, to prepare the minds of men for it, to inure them to ideas of
    it, to raise their expectation of it, and strengthen their faith in it; and
    the rather since these attributions were more frequent before the coming of
    Christ in the flesh, and very rarely used afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor will the formation of man in the image, and after the likeness of God,
    afford a sufficient argument to prove that there is something corporeal in
    God, seeing man has a soul or spirit, in which this image and likeness
    chiefly and principally lay; and which was originally created in
    righteousness and holiness, in wisdom and knowledge: and though he has a
    body also; yet, inasmuch as a body was prepared in the council and covenant
    of grace, from eternity, for the Son of God to assume in time; and in the
    book of God&#x27;s eternal purposes, &quot;all the members of it were
    written; which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of
    them&quot;, (Hebrews 10:5; Psalm 139:16). God might, according to the idea
    of it in his eternal mind, form the body of the first man.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The description of God, as a Spirit, teaches us to ascribe to God all the
    excellencies to be found in spirits in a more eminent manner, and to
    consider them as transcendent and infinite in him. By spirits, I understand
    not subtilized bodies, extracted out of various things; nor the wind and
    air, so called because invisible, and very piercing and penetrating, though
    bodies, and very ponderous ones; nor the spirits of animals, which are
    material, die, and go downwards to the earth: but rational spirits, angels,
    and the souls of men; the former are called spirits, (Zechariah 6:5; Hebrews
    1:1, 5) and so are the latter, (Job 32:8; Hebrews 12:23) they are indeed
    created spirits, (Psalm 104:4; Zechariah 12:1) but God an uncreated one, and
    is the Creator of these, and therefore said to be, &quot;the Father of
    spirits&quot;, (Hebrews 12:9).
  </p>
  <p>
    These are creatures of time, and finite beings; made since the world was,
    and are not every where: but God is an eternal, infinite, and immense
    Spirit, from everlasting to everlasting; and whom &quot;the Heaven of
    heavens cannot contain&quot;; yet there are some excellencies in spirits,
    which may lead more easily to conceive somewhat of God, and of his divine
    nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits are immaterial, have no corporal parts, as flesh, blood, and bones,
    (Luke 24:39) and though eyes, hands, etc. are ascribed to God, yet not of
    flesh, (Job 10:4) but such as express what is suitable to spiritual beings
    in the most exalted sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits are incorruptible; for having no matter about them, they are not
    liable to corruption; they are, indeed, capable of moral corruption, as
    appears from the angels that sinned, and, from the depravity of the souls of
    men by the fall; but not of natural corruption: but God is not subject to
    corruption in any sense, and is therefore called the &quot;incorruptible
    God&quot;, (Romans 1:23) Spirits are immortal; angels die not, (Luke 20:36)
    the souls of men cannot be killed, (Matthew 10:28) not consisting of parts,
    that are capable of being divided and separated, they cannot be brought to
    destruction. It is one of the characters of God, that he is
    &quot;immortal&quot;, yes, &quot;only has immortality&quot;; and so more
    transcendently, and in a more eminent manner immortal than angels, and the
    souls of men; he has it of himself, and underivatively, and is the giver of
    it to others, (1 Timothy 1:17, 6:16).
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits are invisible; it is a vulgar mistake that they are to be seen; who
    ever saw the soul of a man? or an angel, in its pure form? whenever they
    have made themselves visible, it has been by assuming another form, an human
    one. &quot;God is invisible, and dwells in light, which no man can approach
    unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see&quot;, (1 Timothy 1:17, 6:16) and
    therefore as no likeness and similitude of a spirit can be formed and taken,
    so none of God: who can tell of what color, form and figure, shape and size,
    the soul of a man is?
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor can any describe the form and figure of an angel: as for the pictures,
    paintings, and sculptures of them, they are the fruit of mere fancy and
    imagination, and at most but emblematical: because angels have appeared in
    an human form, therefore they are painted as young men; and because of their
    quick dispatch, and swiftness, in doing the errands and messages they have
    been sent upon, wings are given, them; but never was such a creature in real
    being, or ever seen in the whole world, in any age, as a young man with
    wings at his shoulders.
  </p>
  <p>
    So no likeness can be formed of God; no similitude was ever seen of him, and
    to whom can he be likened and compared? (Deuteronomy 4:12; Isa 40:18, 46:5).
    Some of the Heathens have acknowledged the invisibility of God, as a Spirit;
    and Aristotle argues the invisibility of God, from the invisibility of the
    soul of man.
  </p>
  <p>
    But besides these properties, there are others still more excellent in
    spirits, by which they approach nearer to God, and bear a greater
    resemblance to him, and serve to give us clearer ideas of his nature; they
    are living, active, endowed with understanding, will, and affections; they
    are lively, have a principle of life; angels are commonly thought to be the
    living creatures in Ezekiel&#x27;s vision; however, they are such, and so
    the souls of men: the body of Adam, when first made, was a lifeless lump of
    clay; but when God breathed into him the breath of life, &quot;he became a
    living soul&quot;, (Genesis 2:7). God is the living God, has life in and of
    himself, and gives life to all creatures that have it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits are active, and can operate upon others, as the souls of men on
    their bodies; God is all act, &quot;actus simplicissimus&quot;, as he is
    sometimes styled, the most simple act; there is nothing passive in him, as
    matter, to be wrought upon; he works, and always works; and &quot;all
    creatures live and move, and have their being in him&quot;, (John 5:17; Acts
    17:28).
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits, angels, and the souls of men, are intelligent beings, have a
    faculty of understanding things natural and spiritual; the understanding of
    God is infinite, there is no searching of it; lie understands himself, and
    all created beings, and their natures, (Psalm 147:6; Isaiah 40:28).
  </p>
  <p>
    Spirits have the power of willing, they are voluntary agents; and God wills
    whatever he does, and does whatever he wills; his will is boundless,
    uncontrollable, and sovereign, (Psalm 115:3; Daniel 4:35). Spirits have the
    affections of love, mercy, pity, etc. God not only loves his creatures, but
    &quot;is love itself&quot;, (1 John 4:16). &quot;His mercy is from
    everlasting to everlasting, on them that fear him&quot;; and he pities them
    as a father pities his children, (Psalm 103:13, 17).
  </p>
  <p>
    3. God being a Spirit, we learn that he is a simple and uncompounded Being,
    and does not consist of parts, as a body does; his spirituality involves his
    simplicity: some indeed consider this as an attribute of God; and his
    spirituality also: and, indeed, every attribute of God, is God himself, is
    his nature, and are only so many ways of considering it, or are so many
    displays of it. However, it is certain God is not composed of parts, in any
    sense; not in a physical sense, of essential parts, as matter and form, of
    which bodies consist: nor of integral parts, as soul and body, of which men
    consist: nor in a &quot;metaphysical&quot; sense, as of essence and
    existence, of act and power: nor in a &quot;logical&quot; sense, as of kind
    and difference, substance and accident; all which would argue imperfection,
    weakness, and mutability.
  </p>
  <p>
    If God was composed of parts he would not be &quot;eternal&quot;, and
    absolutely the first Being, since the composing parts would, at least,
    co-exist with him; besides, the composing parts, in our conception of them,
    would be prior to the compositum; as the body and soul of man, of which he
    is composed, are prior to his being a man: and, beside, there must be a
    composer, who puts the parts together, and therefore must be before what is
    composed of them: all which is inconsistent with the eternity of God: nor
    would he be &quot;infinite&quot; and &quot;immense&quot;; for either these
    parts are finite, or infinite; if finite, they can never compose an infinite
    Being; and if infinite, there must be more infinities than one, which
    implies a contradiction: nor would he be &quot;independent&quot;; for what
    is composed of parts, depends upon those parts, and the union of them, by
    which it is preserved: nor would he be &quot;immutable&quot;, unalterable,
    and immortal; since what consists of parts, and depends upon the union of
    them, is liable to alteration, and to be resolved into those parts again,
    and so be dissolved and come to destruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, he would not be the most perfect of Beings; for as the more
    spiritual a being is, the more perfect it is; and so it is, the more simple
    and uncompounded it is: as even all things in nature are more noble, and
    more pure, the more free they are from composition and mixture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor is the simplicity of God to be disproved by the Trinity of Persons in
    the Godhead; for though there are three distinct persons, there is but one
    nature and essence common to them all, and which is not parted and divided
    among them, but is jointly and equally possessed by them; nor do these
    persons really differ from the divine nature and essence, nor from one
    another, but by their distinct modes of subsisting; so that they only
    distinguish and modify, but do neither divide nor compose the divine nature:
    nor is it to be disproved by the decrees of God; the decrees of God are
    within himself, and, as it is commonly said, whatever is in God, is God, and
    so are no other than God himself, as to the act of decreeing, though not
    with respect to the things decreed.
  </p>
  <p>
    And though they are many and various, as to the objects of them, yet not in
    God, who, by one eternal act, in his infinite mind, has decreed everything
    that has been, is, or shall be; and is what Plato means by en kai polla,
    &quot;one&quot; and &quot;many&quot; in God; one, as to his essence; many,
    as to the ideas and decrees in it, which many are one: nor is it to be
    disproved by the attributes of God; for they are no other than God himself,
    and neither differ from one another, but with respect to their objects, and
    effect, and in our manner of conception of them; nor from the nature and
    essence of God; they are himself, and his nature; he is not only eternal,
    wise, good, loving, etc. but he is eternity itself, wisdom itself, goodness
    itself, love itself, etc. and these are not parts of his nature, but
    displays of the same undivided nature, and are different considerations of
    it, in which we view it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our minds being so weak as not to be able to conceive of God at once and
    together, and in the gross, but one thing after another, and the same in
    different lights, that we may better understand it: these several things,
    called attributes, which are one in God, are predicated of him, and ascribed
    to him distinctly, for helps to our finite understandings, and for the
    relief of our minds; and that we, with more facility and ease, might
    conceive of the nature of God, and take in more of him, as we can by parcels
    and piece-meals, than in the whole; and so, as a learned Jew observes, all
    those attributes are only intellectual notions; by which are conceived the
    perfections that are in the essence of God, but in reality are nothing but
    his essence; and which attributes will be next considered.
