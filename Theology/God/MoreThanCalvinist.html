    To be enabled to form a clear, consistent, and comprehensive judgment of the
    truths revealed in the Scripture, is a great privilege; But they who possess
    it are exposed to the temptation of thinking too highly of themselves, and
    too meanly of others, especially of those who not only refuse to adopt their
    sentiments, but venture to oppose them. We see few controversial writings,
    however excellent in other respects, but are tinctured with this spirit of
    self-superiority; and they who are not called to this service (of writing),
    if they are attentive to what passes in their hearts, may feel it working
    within them, upon a thousand occasions; though so far as it prevails, it
    brings forcibly home to ourselves the charge of ignorance and inconsistence,
    which we are so ready to fix upon our opponents. I know nothing as a means
    more likely to correct this evil, than a serious consideration of the
    amazing difference between our acquired judgment, and our actual experience:
    or, in other words,
    <em
      >how little influence our knowledge and judgment have upon our own
      conduct</em
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    This may confirm to us the truth and propriety of the apostle&#x27;s
    observation, &quot;If any man thinks that he knows any thing, he knows
    nothing yet as he ought to know.&quot; Not that we are bound to be
    insensible that the Lord has taught us what we were once ignorant of; nor is
    it possible that we should be so; yet because, if we estimate our knowledge
    by its effects, and value it no farther than it is experimental and
    operative (which is the proper standard whereby to try it) we shall find it
    so faint and feeble as hardly to deserve the name.
  </p>
  <p>
    How firmly, for instance, are we persuaded, that God is omnipresent! Great
    as the difficulties may be which attend our conceptions of this point, the
    truth itself is controverted by few. It is generally acknowledged by
    unawakened persons and I may add, too frequently known even by believers, as
    if they knew it not. If the eyes of the Lord are in every place, how strong
    a guard should this thought be upon the conduct of those who profess to hear
    him! We know how we are often affected when in the presence of a
    fellow-worm; if he is one on whom we depend, or who is considerably our
    superior in life, how careful we are to compose our behavior, and to avoid
    whatever might be deemed improper or offensive! Is it not strange that those
    who have taken their ideas of the divine majesty, holiness and purity, from
    the Scriptures, and are not wholly insensible of their inexpressible
    obligations to regulate all they say or do by his precepts, should upon many
    occasions he betrayed into improprieties of behavior from which the presence
    of a nobleman, or prince, would have effectually restrained them, yes,
    sometimes perhaps even the presence of a child? Even in the exercise of
    prayer, by which we profess to draw near the Lord, the consideration that
    his eye is upon us has little power to engage our attention, or prevent our
    thoughts from wandering like the fool&#x27;s eye, to the ends of the earth.
    What should we think of a person, who, being admitted into the king&#x27;s
    presence, upon business of the greatest importance, should break off in the
    midst of his address, to pursue a butterfly?
  </p>
  <p>
    Could such an instance of weakness be met with, it would be but a faint
    emblem of the inconsistencies which they who are acquainted with their own
    hearts, can often charge themselves with in prayer. They are not wholly
    ignorant in what a frame of spirit it becomes a needy dependent sinner to
    approach that God, before whom the angels are represented as veiling their
    faces; yet, in defiance of their better judgment, their attention is
    diverted from him with whom they have to do, to the merest trifles. They are
    not able to realize that presence with which they believe themselves to be
    surrounded, but speak as if they were speaking into the air. Further, if our
    sense that God is always present was in any good measure answerable to the
    conviction of our judgment, would it not be an effectual preservative from
    the many importunate though groundless fears with which we are harassed! He
    says, “Fear not, I am with you.” He promises to be a shield and a guard to
    those who put their trust in him, yet though we profess to believe his word,
    and to hope that he is our protector, we seldom think ourselves safe, even
    in the path of duty, a moment longer than danger is kept out of our view.
    Little reason have we to value ourselves upon our knowledge of this
    indisputable truth, when it has no more effective and habitual influence
    upon our conduct.
  </p>
  <p>
    The doctrine of God’s sovereignty also, though not so generally owned as the
    former, is no less fully assented to by those who are called Calvinists. We
    zealously contend for this point in our debates with the Arminians; and are
    ready to wonder that any should he hardy enough to dispute the
    Creator&#x27;s right to do what he will with his own. While we are only
    engaged in defense of the election of grace, and have a comfortable hope
    that we are ourselves of that number, we seem so convinced, by the arguments
    the Scripture affords us in support of the truth, that we can hardly forbear
    charging our adversaries with perverse obstinacy and pride, for opposing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly the ground of this opposition lies in the pride of the human
    heart, but this evil principle is not confined to any party, and occasions
    frequently arise, when they who contend for the divine sovereignty are
    little more practically Influenced by it than their opponents. This
    humiliating doctrine concludes as strongly for submission to the will of
    God, under every circumstance of life, as it does for our acquiescing in his
    purpose to have mercy. But, alas! how often do we find ourselves utterly
    unable to apply it, so as to reconcile our spirits to those afflictions
    which he is pleased to allot us. So far as we are enabled to say, when we
    are exercised with poverty, or heavy losses or crosses. &quot;I was silent
    and did not open my mouth—for You are the One who has done this!&quot; So
    far, and no farther, are we truly convinced, that God has a sovereign right
    to dispose of us and all our concernments as he pleases. How often, and how
    justly at such seasons, might the argument we offer to others, as sufficient
    to silence all their objections be retorted upon ourselves, &quot;Nay but O
    man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say unto
    him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?&quot; A plain proof that our
    knowledge is more notional than experimental. What an inconsistency, that
    while we think God is just and righteous in withholding from others the
    things which pertain to their everlasting peace, we should find it so hard
    to submit to his dispensations to ourselves in matters of unspeakably less
    importance!
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Lords appointments to those who fear Him, are not only sovereign,
    but wise and gracious. He has connected their good with his own glory, and
    is engaged by promise, to make all things work together for their advantage.
    He Chooses for His People Better than They Could Choose for Themselves; if
    they are in heaviness, there is a needs-be for it, and he withholds nothing
    from them but what upon the whole it is better they should be without. Thus
    the Scriptures teach, and thus we profess to believe. Furnished with these
    principles, we are at no loss to suggest motives of patience and consolation
    to our brethren that are afflicted; we can assure them, without hesitation,
    that if they are interested in the promises, their concerns are in safe
    hands; that the things which at present are not joyous but grievous, shall
    in due season yield the peaceful fruits of righteousness, and that their
    trials are as certainly mercies as their comforts. We can prove to them,
    from the history of Joseph. David, Job, and other instances recorded in
    Scriptures, that, notwithstanding any present dark appearances, it shall
    certainly be well with the righteous; that God can and will make crooked
    things straight; and that he often produces the greatest good from those
    events which we are apt to look upon as Evil.
  </p>
  <p>
    From hence we can infer, not only the sinfulness—but the folly of finding
    fault with any of His dispensations. We can tell them, that at the worst the
    sufferings of the present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory
    that shall be revealed; and that therefore, under the greatest pressures,
    they should so weep as those who expect in a little time to have all their
    tears wiped away. But when the case is our own, when we are troubled on
    every side. Or if touched in the tenderest part, how difficult it is to feel
    the force of these reasonings, though we know they are true to a
    demonstration! Then, unless we are endued with fresh strength from on high,
    we are as liable to complain and despond as if we thought our afflictions
    sprang out of the ground, and the Lord had forgotten to be gracious.
  </p>
  <p>
    I might proceed to show the difference between our judgment when most
    enlightened, and our actual experience, with respect to every spiritual
    truth. We know there is no proportion between time and eternity, between God
    and the creature, the favor of the Lord and the favor or the frowns of men;
    and yet often, when these things are brought into close competition, we are
    sorely put to it to keep steadfast in the path of duty; no without new
    supplies of grace, we should certainly fail in the time of trial, and our
    knowledge would have no other effect than to render our guilt more
    inexcusable. We seem to be sure that we are weak, sinful, fallible
    creatures, as we are that we exist and yet we are prone to act as if we were
    wise and good. In a word, we cannot deny that a great part of our knowledge
    is, as I have described it, like the light of the moon- destitute of heat
    and influence; and yet we can hardly help thinking of ourselves too highly
    upon the account of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    May we not say with the Psalmist, &quot;Lord, what is man!&quot; yes, what
    an enigma! What a poor inconsistent creature is a believer! He knows the
    Lord; he knows himself. His understanding is enlightened to apprehend and
    contemplate the great mysteries of the gospel. He has sound ideas of the
    evil of sin, the vanity of the world, the beauties of holiness, and the
    nature of true happiness. He was once &quot;darkness, but now he is light in
    the Lord.&quot; He has access to God by Jesus Christ; to whom he is united,
    and in whom he lives by faith. While the principles be has received are
    enlivened by the agency of the Holy Spirit, he can do all things. He is
    humble, gentle, patient, watchful, faithful. He rejoices in afflictions,
    triumphs over temptations, lives upon the foretastes of eternal glory, and
    counts not his life dear, so he may glorify God his Savior, and finish his
    course with joy. But his strength is not his own; he is absolutely
    dependent, and is still encompassed with infirmities, and burdened with a
    depraved nature. If the Lord withdraws his power, he becomes weak as another
    man, and drops as a stone sinks to the earth by its own weight. His inherent
    knowledge may be compared to the windows of a house, which can transmit the
    light, but cannot retain it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without renewed and continual communications from the Spirit of grace, he is
    unable to withstand the smallest temptation, to endure the slightest trial,
    to perform the least service in a due manner, or even to think a good
    thought. He knows this, and yet he too often forgets it. But the Lord
    reminds him of it frequently, by suspending that assistance without which he
    can do nothing. Then he feels what he is, and is easily prevailed upon to
    act in contradiction to his better judgment. This repeated experience of his
    own weakness teaches him by degrees where his strength lies: that it is not
    in any thing he has already attained, or can call his own, but the grace,
    power, and faithfulness of his Savior. He learns to cease from his own
    understanding, to be ashamed of his best endeavors, to abhor himself in dust
    and ashes, and to glory only in the Lord.
  </p>
  <p>
    From hence we may observe, that believers who have most knowledge, are not
    therefore necessarily the most spiritual. Some may and do walk more
    honorably and more comfortably with two talents, than others with five. He
    who experimentally knows his own weakness, and depends simply upon the Lord,
    will surely thrive, though his acquired attainments and abilities may be but
    small; and he who has the greatest gifts, the clearest judgment, and the
    most extensive knowledge, if he indulges high thoughts of his advantages, is
    in imminent danger of mistaking, and falling at every step; for the Lord
    will allow none whom he loves to boast in themselves. He will guide the meek
    with his eyes, and fill the hungry with good things; but the rich he sends
    empty away. It is an invariable maxim in his kingdom, that whosoever exalts
    himself, shall be abased; but he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
