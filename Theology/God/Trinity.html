  <h1>The Trinity</h1>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>There is One God</h2>
  <p>
    The scriptures clearly proclaim the singular nature of the divine - there is
    one sovereign God and no other (Deut 4:35, 6:4; Gal 3:20; Eph 4:6). The
    Bible repeatedly emphasizes that the Lord alone is God; there are no rivals
    to His power and position (Deut 32:39; 2 Sam 7:22; 1 Chron 17:20; Ps 86:10;
    Isa 43:10, 44:6, 45:18). From Genesis to Revelation, the unified message
    resounds - our Creator is the one true God who reigns supreme.
  </p>

  <h2>God is Multi-Personal</h2>
  <p>
    Although there is only one God, the divine nature contains both plurality
    and unity. In the very first chapter of the Bible, God refers to Himself
    using the plural pronoun "us" when declaring His intention to create
    humanity in His own image (Gen 1:26-28).
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, some passages present two distinct figures who are each called
    Lord or Yahweh. For example, Genesis 19:24 portrays Yahweh on earth calling
    down judgment from Yahweh in heaven. Other texts like Isaiah 48:16,
    Zechariah 2:9, Malachi 3:1 and Hebrews 1:8 also suggest a plurality within
    the one being of God, thus providing more evidence that God is
    multi-personal, three in person and one in essence.
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus is called God</h2>
  <p>
    The New Testament clearly teaches the deity of Jesus Christ. The opening
    lines of John's Gospel declare that the divine Word who became incarnate in
    Jesus was Himself God (Jn 1:1). Paul likewise affirms that Christ existed in
    the very form of God prior to His incarnation, indicating His divine nature
    (Php 2:6). He even goes so far as to call Jesus "God over all" (Rom 9:5).
  </p>
  <p>
    In Acts 20:28, the church is said to have been purchased by God's own blood,
    implying that Jesus who shed His blood is Himself God. Jesus' own
    statements, such as "I and the Father are one" (Jn 10:30) were rightly
    understood by His Jewish audience as claims to deity (v. 33).
  </p>
  <p>
    After the resurrection, Thomas confessed the risen Christ as "My Lord and my
    God" (Jn 20:28). Both Paul and John refer to Jesus as "our God and Savior"
    (Titus 2:13, 1 Jn 5:20). The cumulative witness of the New Testament authors
    is that Jesus is not merely an exalted human prophet or teacher, but the
    eternal Son of God who shares fully in the divine nature.
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus has God's Attributes</h2>
  <p>
    The New Testament writers consistently ascribe to Jesus the divine
    attributes, works, and honors that belong to God alone. They clearly
    regarded Him as being fully God and fully man.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus possesses the unique attributes and prerogatives of God Himself. Jesus
    is eternal, having existed before creation (Jn 1:1-3; 8:58; Col 1:17). He is
    unchanging and immutable (Heb 1:10-12; 13:8). He is the source and giver of
    life (Jn 1:4; 5:26; 6:33; 11:25; 14:6; Acts 3:15). In Him dwells all the
    fullness of deity in bodily form (Col 2:9).
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus holds absolute sovereignty over all things (Mat 28:18; Jn 3:31; 17:2;
    Php 2:9-10; Col 1:18; 1 Pet 3:22). He is present everywhere (Mat 18:20; Jn
    14:23; Eph 4:10) and has limitless power (Php 3:21). He is the agent of
    creation (Jn 1:3, 10; 1 Cor 8:6; Col 1:16; Heb 1:8, 10) and the sustainer of
    the universe (Col 1:17; Heb 1:3).
  </p>
  <p>
    Only God can forgive sins, yet Jesus claims that prerogative (Mat 9:2, 6; Lk
    7:48). He sends the Holy Spirit (Jn 15:26; Acts 1:4-5), raises the dead (Jn
    6:27, 40; 10:28; 11:25), and will judge all humanity (Jn 5:22-27; Acts
    17:31; 1 Cor 4:5; 2 Cor 5:10; 2 Tim 4:1). He receives worship reserved
    exclusively for God (Mat 2:2, 11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; 24:52; Jn 9:38; Heb 1:6;
    Rev 5:8-14) and is the object of prayer (Acts 7:59; 1 Cor 1:2).
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus does God Stuff</h2>
  <p>
    The biblical authors deliberately used the same titles, images, and
    descriptions for the Father and the Son, demonstrating their conviction that
    Jesus shares the same divine nature and attributes as God Himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Exodus, God reveals His name as "I Am" (Exod 3:13-14), and later declares
    "I, even I, am He" (Isa 43:10). Remarkably, Jesus takes these same titles
    for Himself, proclaiming "Before Abraham was, I Am" (Jn 8:58) and "I Am He"
    (Jn 8:24; 18:3).
  </p>
  <p>
    Both God (Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 4:8) and Jesus (Rev 1:17; 22:13) are called
    "the first and the last," signifying their eternal nature and sovereign
    rule. The title "King of Kings" is ascribed to God (1 Tim 6:15) and to
    Christ (Rev 17:14; 19:16). Similarly, the Old Testament depicts God as the
    "King of glory" (Ps 24:7, 10; Isa 6:1-3), while the New Testament identifies
    Jesus as the Lord of glory (Jn 12:41; 1 Cor 2:8).
  </p>
  <p>
    God is portrayed as the Redeemer (Ps 78:34; Isa 47:4) who saves His people,
    and Jesus is the one who accomplishes this redemption (Gal 3:13). The Father
    is called Savior (Isa 49:26; 1 Tim 1:1; 4:10), as is the Son (Lk 2:10-11; Jn
    4:42; Acts 4:12; Php 3:20). Titus 2:13 even refers to Jesus as "our great
    God and Savior." Both God (Ps 23:1; 100:3; Isa 40:11) and Jesus (Jn 10:11,
    14; Heb 13:20; 1 Pet 2:25) are metaphorically described as the Shepherd who
    cares for His flock.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Old Testament speaks of God as the rock of refuge and salvation (1 Sam
    2:2; Ps 18:2; 31:2; 89:26 Isa 17:10-11), and Paul identifies Christ as this
    same spiritual rock (1 Cor 10:4). The prophets announced that God was coming
    and called the people to prepare the way for Him (Isa 40:3; Mal 3:1). The
    New Testament shows this was fulfilled in the coming of Jesus (Mat 3:3; Lk
    7:27).
  </p>

  <h2>Jesus is God and Man</h2>
  <p>
    The Old Testament prophets foretold that the coming Messiah would be both
    divine and human. Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would conceive and bear a
    son who would be called Immanuel, meaning "God with us" (Isa 7:14). This
    child is further described as "Mighty God" and "Eternal Father" (Isa 9:6),
    titles that belong to deity alone. Jeremiah likewise announced that the
    righteous Branch of David would bear the name "The LORD [Yahweh] our
    righteousness" (Jer 23:5-6), ascribing to the Messiah the sacred name of God
    Himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The prophet Micah declared that the origins of this ruler of Israel were
    "from of old, from ancient days" (Micah 5:2), demonstrating His eternal
    preexistence. These prophecies point to a Messiah who is not merely an
    exalted human descendant of David, but One who fully shares the identity and
    attributes of God. The New Testament writers recognized Jesus as the
    fulfillment of these prophecies, the divine-human Messiah in whom God became
    incarnate to dwell among us and save us.
  </p>

  <h2>The Holy Spirit is God</h2>
  <p>
    The New Testament affirms the full deity of the Holy Spirit, identifying Him
    as God Himself. When Ananias lied about the proceeds from the sale of his
    property, Peter confronted him saying, "You have not lied to man but to God"
    (Acts 5:4). Just a verse earlier, Peter said Ananias had lied to the Holy
    Spirit (v. 3), directly equating the Holy Spirit with God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, Paul writes, "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of
    the Lord is, there is freedom" (2 Cor 3:17). Here "the Lord" clearly refers
    to Yahweh, the covenant name of God in the Old Testament. By declaring "the
    Lord is the Spirit," Paul makes the bold claim that the Holy Spirit is
    Yahweh, the one true God.
  </p>
  <p>
    These key texts demonstrate that the Apostles understood the Holy Spirit not
    as a created being or impersonal force, but as a fully divine person who is
    God Himself. Along with the Father and the Son, the Spirit is included
    within the unique identity of the one God of Israel.
  </p>

  <h2>The Holy Spirit is a Person</h2>
  <p>
    The Bible consistently portrays the Holy Spirit as a distinct divine Person,
    not an impersonal force or power. The Spirit possesses personal attributes
    and engages in personal activities. He can be grieved or caused sorrow,
    indicating He has emotions (Isa 63:10; Eph 4:30). As the Counselor or
    Advocate, He provides guidance, encouragement, and support to believers (Jn
    14:16; 15:26).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Holy Spirit bears witness and testifies to the truth (Jn 15:26; Heb
    10:15). He teaches Christ's followers and illuminates their understanding of
    God's Word (Jn 14:26). He has an intellect - He hears, speaks, and guides
    God's people (Mk 13:11; Lk 4:1; Jn 16:13; Acts 13:2). He even gives specific
    warnings and directions (Acts 20:23).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Spirit carries out the important ministry of convicting people of their
    sin and need for salvation (Jn 16:8). He intercedes for believers and
    strengthens them in their Christian walk (Acts 9:31; Rom 8:26-27). He is
    able to search all things and knows the deep truths of God, which He then
    reveals to those who are spiritually receptive (1 Cor 2:10-11).
  </p>
  <p>
    These many personal qualities and actions demonstrate that the Holy Spirit
    is not a mere abstract power, but a personal agent who relates to people and
    carries out the works of God. As a divine Person, the Spirit shares fully in
    the one being of the triune God.
  </p>

  <h2>The Trinity</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the New Testament, the three persons of the Trinity are grouped
    together in many ways that show their unity and equality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize new believers "in the name of the
    Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Mat 28:19). By placing the
    three persons together in a single name, Jesus indicates their unity and
    equality. This baptismal formula suggests that the Father, Son, and Holy
    Spirit are distinct persons who share a single divine essence and authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paul often concluded his letters with Trinitarian blessings, such as "The
    grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the
    Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Cor 13:14). The three persons are once again
    grouped together on equal terms as the united source of divine favor and
    spiritual blessings. These benedictions display Paul's underlying
    Trinitarian understanding of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paul teaches that the Holy Spirit searches the depths of God and knows the
    thoughts of God, abilities that only a divine person could possess (1 Cor
    2:10-11). Later in the same letter, he discusses the varieties of spiritual
    gifts, services, and activities. The Spirit's distribution of gifts is
    equated with the Lord's delegation of ministries and God's empowerment for
    service, thus attributing them to the workings of the same triune God (1 Cor
    12:4-6).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Bible ascribes the divine works of creation, redemption, and providence
    to all three persons of the Trinity. The Father creates through His Word and
    by His Spirit (Gen 1:1-2; Ps 33:6). The Son is the agent of creation who
    sustains all things (Col 1:15-17). The Holy Spirit gives life and renews the
    face of the earth (Ps 104:30). Participation in these divine acts implies
    the full deity of each person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paul speaks of his ministry as a priestly service in the gospel of God,
    sanctified by the Holy Spirit (Rom 15:16). He urges the Roman believers to
    join him in his struggle by praying to God for him through the love of the
    Spirit and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom 15:30). God the Father
    establishes and anoints believers, sealing them and giving them the Spirit
    as a guarantee (2 Cor 1:21-22).
  </p>
  <p>
    Believers are chosen by the Father, sanctified by the Spirit, and sprinkled
    with the blood of Jesus (1 Pet 1:2). Christians have access to the Father
    through Christ and by the Spirit (Eph 2:18), being built together into a
    dwelling place for God by the Spirit on the foundation of Christ (Eph
    2:20-22). There is one body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, and God and
    Father of all (Eph 4:4-6).
  </p>
  <p>
    Salvation is accomplished as God sends the Spirit of His Son into our hearts
    (Gal 4:6). Believers are called to pray in the Holy Spirit, keeping
    themselves in the love of God, and waiting for the mercy of the Lord Jesus
    Christ (Jude 20-21). Such passages reflect a Trinitarian pattern of thought
    deeply woven into the theology of the biblical writers.
