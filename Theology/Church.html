  <h2>Chapter 26. Of the Church</h2>
  <p>
    <b>1.</b> The catholic or universal church, which (with respect to the
    internal work of the Spirit and truth of grace) may be called invisible,
    consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be
    gathered into one, under Christ, the head thereof; and is the spouse, the
    body, the fulness of him that fills all in all.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>1. Hebrews 12:23; Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 1:10, 22-23, 5:23, 27, 32</p>
  <p>
    <b>2.</b> All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the
    gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ according unto it, not destroying
    their own profession by any errors everting the foundation, or unholiness of
    conversation, are and may be called visible saints;<sup>2</sup> and of such
    ought all particular congregations to be constituted.<sup>3</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    2. 1 Corinthians 1:2; Acts 11:26<br />
    3. Romans 1:7; Ephesians 1:20-22
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3.</b> The purest churches under heaven are subject to mixture and
    error;<sup>4</sup> and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of
    Christ, but synagogues of Satan;<sup>5</sup> nevertheless Christ always has
    had, and ever shall have a kingdom in this world, to the end thereof, of
    such as believe in him, and make profession of his name.<sup>6</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    4. 1 Corinthians 5; Revelation 2-3<br />
    5. Revelation 18:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12<br />
    6. Matthew 16:18; Psalms 72:17, 102:28; Revelation 12:17
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.</b> The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the church, in whom, by the
    appointment of the Father, all power for the calling, institution, order or
    government of the church, is invested in a supreme and sovereign manner;<sup
      >7</sup
    >
    neither can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof, but is that
    antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalts himself in
    the church against Christ, and all that is called God; whom the Lord shall
    destroy with the brightness of his coming.<sup>8</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Colossians 1:18; Matthew 28:18-20; Ephesians 4:11-12<br />
    8. 2 Thessalonians 2:2-9
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.</b> In the execution of this power wherewith he is so intrusted, the
    Lord Jesus calls out of the world unto himself, through the ministry of his
    word, by his Spirit, those that are given unto him by his Father,<sup
      >9</sup
    >
    that they may walk before him in all the ways of obedience, which he
    prescribes to them in his word.<sup>10</sup> Those thus called, he commands
    to walk together in particular societies, or churches, for their mutual
    edification, and the due performance of that public worship, which he
    requires of them in the world.<sup>11</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    9. John 10:16; John 12:32<br />
    10. Matthew 28:20<br />
    11. Matthew 18:15-20
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>6.</b> The members of these churches are saints by calling, visibly
    manifesting and evidencing (in and by their profession and walking) their
    obedience unto that call of Christ;<sup>12</sup> and do willingly consent to
    walk together, according to the appointment of Christ; giving up themselves
    to the Lord, and one to another, by the will of God, in professed subjection
    to the ordinances of the Gospel.<sup>13</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    12. Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2<br />
    13. Acts 2:41-42, 5:13-14; 2 Corinthians 9:13
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>7.</b> To each of these churches therefore gathered, according to his
    mind declared in his word, he has given all that power and authority, which
    is in any way needful for their carrying on that order in worship and
    discipline, which he has instituted for them to observe; with commands and
    rules for the due and right exerting, and executing of that power.<sup
      >14</sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>14. Matthew 18:17-18; 1 Corinthians 5:4-5, 5:13, 2 Corinthians 2:6-8</p>
  <p>
    <b>8.</b> A particular church, gathered and completely organized according
    to the mind of Christ, consists of officers and members; and the officers
    appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the church (so called and
    gathered), for the peculiar administration of ordinances, and execution of
    power or duty, which he intrusts them with, or calls them to, to be
    continued to the end of the world, are bishops or elders, and deacons.<sup
      >15</sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>15. Acts 20:17, 28; Philemon 1:1</p>
  <p>
    <b>9.</b> The way appointed by Christ for the calling of any person, fitted
    and gifted by the Holy Spirit, unto the office of bishop or elder in a
    church, is, that he be chosen thereunto by the common suffrage of the church
    itself;<sup>16</sup> and solemnly set apart by fasting and prayer, with
    imposition of hands of the eldership of the church, if there be any before
    constituted therein;<sup>17</sup> and of a deacon that he be chosen by the
    like suffrage, and set apart by prayer, and the like imposition of
    hands.<sup>18</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    16. Acts 14:23<br />
    17. 1 Timothy 4:14<br />
    18. Acts 6:3, 5-6
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>10.</b> The work of pastors being constantly to attend the service of
    Christ, in his churches, in the ministry of the word and prayer, with
    watching for their souls, as they that must give an account to Him;<sup
      >19</sup
    >
    it is incumbent on the churches to whom they minister, not only to give them
    all due respect, but also to communicate to them of all their good things
    according to their ability,<sup>20</sup> so as they may have a comfortable
    supply, without being themselves entangled in secular affairs;<sup>21</sup>
    and may also be capable of exercising hospitality towards others;<sup
      >22</sup
    >
    and this is required by the law of nature, and by the express order of our
    Lord Jesus, who has ordained that they that preach the Gospel should live of
    the Gospel.<sup>23</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    19. Acts 6:4; Hebrews 13:17<br />
    20. 1 Timothy 5:17-18; Galatians 6:6-7<br />
    21. 2 Timothy 2:4<br />
    22. 1 Timothy 3:2<br />
    23. 1 Corinthians 9:6-14
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>11.</b> Although it be incumbent on the bishops or pastors of the
    churches, to be instant in preaching the word, by way of office, yet the
    work of preaching the word is not so peculiarly confined to them but that
    others also gifted and fitted by the Holy Spirit for it, and approved and
    called by the church, may and ought to perform it.<sup>24</sup>
  </p>
  <p>24. Acts 11:19-21; 1 Peter 4:10-11</p>
  <p>
    <b>12.</b> As all believers are bound to join themselves to particular
    churches, when and where they have opportunity so to do; so all that are
    admitted unto the privileges of a church, are also under the censures and
    government thereof, according to the rule of Christ.<sup>25</sup>
  </p>
  <p>25. 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14-15</p>
  <p>
    <b>13.</b> No church members, upon any offence taken by them, having
    performed their duty required of them towards the person they are offended
    at, ought to disturb any church-order, or absent themselves from the
    assemblies of the church, or administration of any ordinances, upon the
    account of such offence at any of their fellow members, but to wait upon
    Christ, in the further proceeding of the church.<sup>26</sup>
  </p>
  <p>26. Matthew 18:15-17; Ephesians 4:2-3</p>
  <p>
    <b>14.</b> As each church, and all the members of it, are bound to pray
    continually for the good and prosperity of all the churches of Christ,<sup
      >27</sup
    >
    in all places, and upon all occasions to further every one within the bounds
    of their places and callings, in the exercise of their gifts and graces, so
    the churches, when planted by the providence of God, so as they may enjoy
    opportunity and advantage for it, ought to hold communion among themselves,
    for their peace, increase of love, and mutual edification<sup>28</sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    27. Ephesians 6:18; Psalms 122:6<br />
    28. Romans 16:1-2; 3 John 8-10
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>15.</b> In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of
    doctrine or administration, wherein either the churches in general are
    concerned, or any one church, in their peace, union, and edification; or any
    member or members of any church are injured, in or by any proceedings in
    censures not agreeable to truth and order: it is according to the mind of
    Christ, that many churches holding communion together, do, by their
    messengers, meet to consider, and give their advice in or about that matter
    in difference, to be reported to all the churches concerned;<sup>29</sup>
    howbeit these messengers assembled, are not intrusted with any church-power
    properly so called; or with any jurisdiction over the churches themselves,
    to exercise any censures either over any churches or persons; or to impose
    their determination on the churches or officers.<sup>30</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    29. Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22-23, 25<br />
    30. 2 Corinthians 1:24; 1 John 4:1
