            <em>Psalm 90:2</em>: "Before the mountains were brought forth, or
            ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to
            everlasting you are God."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Malachi 3:6</em>: "For I the Lord do not change; therefore you,
            O children of Jacob, are not consumed."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Numbers 23:19</em>: "God is not man, that he should lie, or a
            son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he
            not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hosea 11:9</em>: "I will not execute my burning anger; I will
            not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy One
            in your midst, and I will not come in wrath."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Jeremiah 23:24</em>: "Can a man hide himself in secret places so
            that I cannot see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and
            earth? declares the Lord."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>2 Chronicles 6:18</em>: "But will God indeed dwell with man on
            the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you,
            how much less this house that I have built!"
