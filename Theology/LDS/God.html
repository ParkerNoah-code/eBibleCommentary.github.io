          <li>
            <em>Numbers 23:19</em>: "God is not a man, that He would lie, Nor a
            son of man, that He would change His mind; Has He said, and will He
            not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?"

            <em>Hosea 11:9</em>: "I will not carry out My fierce anger; I will
            not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not a man, the Holy One
            in your midst, And I will not come in wrath."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Jeremiah 23:24</em>: "'Can a person hide himself in hiding
            places So that I do not see him?' declares the Lord. 'Do I not fill

          <br />
          <li>
