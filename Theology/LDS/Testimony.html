        <h2>Addressing the LDS Testimony</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Proverbs 14:12</em>: "There is a way that seems right to a man,
            but its end is the way to death."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Jeremiah 17:9</em>: "The heart is deceitful above all things,
            and desperately sick; who can understand it?"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Acts 17:11</em>: "Now these Jews were more noble than those in
            Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining
            the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Thessalonians 5:21</em>: "but test everything; hold fast what
            is good."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>James 1:5</em>: "If any of you lacks wisdom [<em>sophia</em>],
            let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and
            it will be given him."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          These verses are helpful for addressing what is commonly described as
          a "burning in the bosom," which LDS point to as confirmation of the
          truthfulness of their theology. However, subjective feelings are not
          the standard of truth. The heart is deceitful, but the Word of God is
          True. God is unchanging and cannot lie. We must appeal to what He has
          said to have epistemic grounding and certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be effective to point out that many people are very certain
          about their views of Jesus. Islam teaches that Jesus is the greatest
          prophet but is not divine and didn't die on the cross, Jehovah's
          Witnesses say that Jesus is Michael the Archangel, Heaven's Gate
          taught that Jesus was an alien and they looked to catch a spaceship to
          heaven. You can also share your own testimony, but the main point to
          get across is that feelings cannot be equated with truth. God's Word
          is sufficient and authoritative to settle matters of doctrinal
          dispute.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Acts 17:11</em>: "Now these people were more noble-minded than
            those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great
            eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these
            things were so."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The context is that Paul and Silas just got kicked out of Thessalonica
          for preaching the gospel, and they had moved on to Berea. And though
          the Bereans did not know Paul and Silas beforehand and had never heard
          the gospel before, they accepted them and tested their claims by
          Scripture. We are told they were more noble for this. They are laid
          out as an example for us to follow. Just like Paul tells us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>1 Thessalonians 5:21</em>: "but examine everything; hold firmly
            to that which is good"
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>James 1:5</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "If any of you lacks wisdom [<em>sophia</em>], let him ask God, who
            gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."
          </li>
        </ul>

          <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2009/04/line-upon-line-james-1-5-6?lang=eng"

            >James 1:5–6</a
          >: "Reading this verse led Joseph Smith to pray in the Sacred Grove,
          where he experienced the First Vision (see Joseph Smith—History
          1:11–17)."
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph Smith cited this verse about going out into the woods to pray
          before his First Vision experience and receiving new revelation. I
          point out that the word for wisdom used in this verse in Greek is
          <em>sophia</em> (like philosophy, philo-sophia, the love of wisdom).
          It is not <em>gnosis</em>, meaning knowledge. Having pointed out that
          Scripture is our standard for all claims of knowledge with the
          previous few verses, it can be helpful to preemptively raise this
          verse before your interlocutor can (this is a favorite verse of many
          LDS), and interpret it correctly for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          James White says, "Hence we see that the Bible does not contradict
          itself, but does indeed tell us that God’s revealed Word is the final
          authority, not our feelings or prayers, no matter how strong those
          feelings, or sincere those prayers."
