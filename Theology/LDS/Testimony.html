            <em>Proverbs 14:12</em>: "There is a way which seems right to a

            <em>Jeremiah 17:9</em>: "The heart is more deceitful than all else
            And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Acts 17:11</em>: "Now these people were more noble-minded than
            those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great
            eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these
            things were so."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Thessalonians 5:21</em>: "but examine everything; hold firmly
            to that which is good,"
          </li>

            <em>James 1:5</em>: "But if any of you lacks wisdom
            [<em>sophia</em>], let him ask of God, who gives to all generously
            and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          These verses are helpful for addressing what is commonly described as
          a "burning in the bosom," which they claim as confirmation of the
          truthfulness of Mormonism. However, subjective feelings are not the
          standard of truth. The heart is deceitful, but the Word of God is
          True. God is unchanging and cannot lie. We must appeal to what He has
          said to have epistemic grounding and certainty.
        </p>

          It can be effective to point out that many people are very certain
          about their views of Jesus. Islam teaches that Jesus is the greatest
          prophet but is not divine and didn't die on the cross, Jehovah's
          Witnesses say that Jesus is Michael the Archangel, Heaven's Gate
          taught that Jesus was an alien and they looked to catch a spaceship to
          heaven.
