            <em>Acts 17:11</em>: "Now these people were more noble-minded than
            those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great
            eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these
            things were so."

            [<em>sophia</em>], let him ask of God, who gives to all generously
            and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
