          <li>
            <em>Colossians 1:15-17</em>: "He is the image of the invisible God,
            the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created,
            in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or
            dominions or rulers or authoritiesâ€”all things were created through
            him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things
            hold together."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 1:3</em>: "All things were made through him, and without
            him was not any thing made that was made."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Ezekiel 28:13</em>: "You were in Eden, the garden of God; every
            precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and diamond,
            beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and
            crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day
            that you were created they were prepared."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Revelation 22:13</em>: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first
            and the last, the beginning and the end."
