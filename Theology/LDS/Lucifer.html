        <h2>Jesus and Lucifer Not Spirit-Brothers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Colossians 1:15-17</em>: "He is the image of the invisible God,
            the firstborn of all creation: for by Him all things were created,
            both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether
            thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authoritiesâ€”all things have
            been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and
            in Him all things hold together."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 1:3</em>: "All things came into being through Him, and
            apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into
            being."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Ezekiel 28:13</em>: "You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every
            precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz and the
            diamond; The beryl, the onyx and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the
            turquoise and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your
            settings and sockets, Was in you. On the day that you were created
            They were prepared."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Revelation 22:13</em>: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first
            and the last, the beginning and the end."
