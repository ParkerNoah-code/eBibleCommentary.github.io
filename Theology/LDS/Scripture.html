        <h2>The Authority of God’s Word</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Proverbs 30:5-6</em>: "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield
            to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to His words Or He will
            rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Proverbs 13:13</em>: "One who despises the word will do badly,
            But one who fears the commandment will be rewarded."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Isaiah 40:8</em>: "The grass withers, the flower fades, But the
            word of our God stands forever."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Matthew 24:35</em>: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My
            words will not pass away."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          The authority of God’s Word as the ultimate standard of truth is
          foundational for Christians and a critical topic to address when
          witnessing to LDS members as they often question and diminish the role
          of the Bible. The key take away from these verses is the divine
          authority, reliability, and immutability of God's Word, standing firm
          even when all else fades or passes away. It also highlights the danger
          of adding, taking away, or neglecting any words in Scripture.
        </p>

        <h2>Translation</h2>
        <p>

            target="_blank"
            >Article of Faith 8</a
          >, written by Joseph Smith, says, "We believe the Bible to be the word
          of God <em>as far as it is translated correctly</em>; we also believe
          the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." That qualifier is often
          used to deny the clear testimony of Scripture about fundamental
          articles of the Christian faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to this, you should know the difference between the
          transmission and translation of the Bible. Although the Bible has had
          many translations, the process of expressing the biblical text in a
          language different than the one it was written in, the transmission of
          the text, the passing down of the scriptures through the centuries,
          has happened reliably and in the original languages they were written
          in. You can still learn the biblical languages to this day, and read
          it for yourself with great confidence that the text has been preserved
          by God.
