        <h2>Salvation</h2>
        <p>1. The Gospel</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 15:1, 3-5</em>: "Now I make known to you, brothers
            and sisters, the gospel which I preached to you, which you also
            received, in which you also stand... For I handed down to you as of
            first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins
            according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was
            raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He
            appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 1:14, 17-18</em>: "I am thankful that I baptized
            none of you except Crispus and Gaius... For Christ did not send me
            to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with cleverness of speech,
            so that the cross of Christ would not be made of no effect."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Sin</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:23</em>: "for all have sinned and fall short of the
            glory of God,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Ecclesiastes 7:20</em>: "Indeed, there is not a righteous person
            on earth who always does good and does not ever sin."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:10-11</em>: "as it is written: 'there is no righteous
            person, not even one; there is no one who understands, there is no
            one who seeks out God;"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Faith</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>John 5:24</em>: "Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears
            My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does
            not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 3:17-18</em>: "For God did not send the Son into the world
            to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through
            Him. The one who believes in Him is not judged; the one who does not
            believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the
            name of the only Son of God."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. Justification</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:20, 28</em>: "because by the works of the Law none of
            mankind will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes
            knowledge of sin... For we maintain that a person is justified by
            faith apart from works of the Law."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>2 Corinthians 5:21</em>: "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
            in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in
            Him."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>5. Works</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Ephesians 2:8-10</em>: "For by grace you have been saved through
            faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a
            result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His
            workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
            prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 6:28-29</em>: "Therefore they said to Him, 'What are we to
            do, so that we may accomplish the works of God?' Jesus answered and
            said to them, 'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom
            He has sent.'"
          </li>
