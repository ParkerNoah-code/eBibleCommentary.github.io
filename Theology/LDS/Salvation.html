        <h2>Salvation</h2>
        <p>1. The Gospel</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 15:1, 3-5</em>: "Now I would remind you, brothers,
            of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you
            stand... For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also
            received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
            Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day
            in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,
            then to the twelve."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 1:14, 17-18</em>: "I thank God that I baptized
            none of you except Crispus and Gaius... For Christ did not send me
            to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent
            wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the
            word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who
            are being saved it is the power of God."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Sin</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:23</em>: "for all have sinned and fall short of the
            glory of God,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Ecclesiastes 7:20</em>: "Surely there is not a righteous man on
            earth who does good and never sins."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:10-11</em>: "as it is written: 'None is righteous, no,
            not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.'"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Faith</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>John 5:24</em>: "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my
            word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come
            into judgment, but has passed from death to life."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 3:17-18</em>: "For God did not send his Son into the world
            to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved
            through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever
            does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed
            in the name of the only Son of God."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. Justification</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Romans 3:20, 28</em>: "For by works of the law no human being
            will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes
            knowledge of sin... For we hold that one is justified by faith apart
            from works of the law."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>2 Corinthians 5:21</em>: "For our sake he made him to be sin who
            knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of
            God."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>5. Works</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Ephesians 2:8-10</em>: "For by grace you have been saved through
            faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a
            result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his
            workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
            prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 6:28-29</em>: "Then they said to him, 'What must we do, to
            be doing the works of God?' Jesus answered them, 'This is the work
            of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.'"
          </li>
