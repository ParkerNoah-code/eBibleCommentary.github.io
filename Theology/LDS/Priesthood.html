        <h2>Priesthoods in the Bible</h2>
        <p>1. The Aaronic Priesthood</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Numbers 16:40</em>: "as a reminder to the sons of Israel so that
            no layman, anyone who was not of the descendants of Aaron, would
            approach to burn incense before the Lord; then he would not become
            like Korah and his group—just as the Lord had spoken to him through
            Moses."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 5:4</em>: "And no one takes the honor for himself, but
            receives it when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. The Melchizedek Priesthood</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:3</em>: "Without father, without mother, without
            genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but
            made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:24-25</em>: "Jesus, on the other hand, because He
            continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. Therefore He is
            also able to save forever those who come to God through Him, since
            He always lives to make intercession for them."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:12</em>: "For when the priesthood is changed, of
            necessity there takes place a change of law also."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 8:4</em>: "Now if He were on earth, He would not be a
            priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according
            to the Law;"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Access to God Through Christ</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Matthew 27:51</em>: "And behold, the veil of the temple was torn
            in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were
            split."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 1:12</em>: "But as many as received Him, to them He gave
            the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His
            name,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Revelation 1:6</em>: "and He made us into a kingdom, priests to
            His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and
            ever. Amen."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Peter 2:5</em>: "you also, as living stones, are being built
            up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual
            sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
          </li>
