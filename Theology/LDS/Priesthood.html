        <h2>Priesthoods in the Bible</h2>
        <p>1. The Aaronic Priesthood</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Numbers 16:40</em>: "to be a reminder to the people of Israel,
            so that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should
            draw near to burn incense before the Lord, lest he become like Korah
            and his company—as the Lord said to him through Moses."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 5:4</em>: "For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh
            day in this way: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all his
            works."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. The Melchizedek Priesthood</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:3</em>: "He is without father or mother or genealogy,
            having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the
            Son of God he continues a priest forever."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:24-25</em>: "but he holds his priesthood permanently,
            because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to
            the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he
            always lives to make intercession for them."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 7:12</em>: "For when there is a change in the
            priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 8:4</em>: "Now if he were on earth, he would not be a
            priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to
            the law."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Access to God Through Christ</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Matthew 27:51</em>: "And behold, the curtain of the temple was
            torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks
            were split."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 1:12</em>: "But to all who did receive him, who believed in
            his name, he gave the right to become children of God,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Revelation 1:6</em>: "and made us a kingdom, priests to his God
            and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Peter 2:5</em>: "who by God’s power are being guarded through
            faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
          </li>
        </ul>
