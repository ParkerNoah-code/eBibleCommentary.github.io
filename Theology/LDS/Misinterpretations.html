        <h2>Clarifying Misinterpretations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 8:4-6</em>: "Therefore, concerning the eating of
            food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing at all in
            the world, and that there is no God but one. For even if there are
            so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are
            many gods and many lords, yet for us there is only one God, the
            Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for Him; and one
            Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through
            Him."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 10:34</em>: "Jesus answered them, â€œHas it not been written
            in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 1:1-3</em>: "God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers
            in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last
            days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all
            things, through whom He also made the world. And He is the radiance
            of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds
            all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification
            of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Luke 16:16</em>: "The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until
            John came; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been
            preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 15:29</em>: "For otherwise, what will those do who
            are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why
            then are they baptized for them?"
