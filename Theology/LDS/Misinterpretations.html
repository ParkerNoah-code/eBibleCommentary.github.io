        <h2>Clarifying Misinterpretations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 8:4-6</em>: "Therefore, as to the eating of food
            offered to idols, we know that 'an idol has no real existence,' and
            that 'there is no God but one.' For although there may be so-called
            gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many 'gods' and many
            'lords'— yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all
            things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
            whom are all things and through whom we exist."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>John 10:34</em>: "Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in
            your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’?”"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Hebrews 1:1-3</em>: "Long ago, at many times and in many ways,
            God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he
            has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all
            things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance
            of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he
            upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making
            purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty
            on high,"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>Luke 16:16</em>: "The Law and the Prophets were until John;
            since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and
            everyone forces his way into it."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <em>1 Corinthians 15:29</em>: "Otherwise, what do people mean by
            being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at
            all, why are people baptized on their behalf?"
          </li>
