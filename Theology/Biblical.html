    - Particular Baptist Covenant Theology sees the centrality of covenants in
    God's unfolding plan of redemption throughout history, including the eternal
    plan of God in the Covenant of Redemption, the Covenant of Works broken by
    Adam, and the Covenant of Grace revealed progressively in post-fall
    covenants and fulfilled in the New Covenant.
