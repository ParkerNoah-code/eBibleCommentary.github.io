          The Bible is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible standard of
          all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience. The light of nature and
          the works of creation and providence clearly demonstrate the goodness,
          wisdom, and power of God, so that people have no excuse. However,
          these things are not sufficient to give the knowledge of God and his
          will that is necessary for salvation. Therefore, the Lord was pleased
          at various times and in various manners to reveal himself and to
          declare his will to his church. Then, to better preserve and propagate
          the truth, and to better establish and comfort the church against the
          corruption of the flesh and the malice of Satan and the world, God put
          his revelations completely into writing. Now, the Bible is necessary
          because God's former ways of revealing his will to his people have
          ceased.
