        saints can smell the error. Rightly, they start drifting away, but sadly,
        often into the worst extremes of emotionalism"

        world to good for those who love him; it is rather that he himself brings
        about these evil aspects for his glory (see Ex. 9:13-16; John 9:3) and his
        people’s good (see Heb. 12:3-11; James 1:2-4)."

        real-life experience? The question is a burning one. It is urgent and
        serious and personal—do I have saving faith? Am I saved? 'By grace you
        have been saved <em>through faith</em>' (Eph. 2:8). 'Whoever
        <em>believes</em> has eternal life' (John 6:47). Does that include me? Do
        I have <em>saving faith</em>?"

          >When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight for Joy</a
        >. "Christian Hedonism is a liberating and devastating doctrine. It
        teaches that the value of God shines more brightly in the soul that finds
        deepest satisfaction in him. Therefore it is liberating because it
        endorses our inborn desire for joy. And it is devastating because it
        reveals that no one desires God with the passion he demands.
        Paradoxically, many people experience both of these truths."

          >What Is The Gospel?</a
        >. "The author is convinced that what has been known in church history as
        Calvinism is the purest and most consistent embodiment of the religion of
        faith, while that which has been known as Arminianism has been diluted to
        a dangerous degree by the religion of works and is therefore an
        inconsistent and unstable form of Christianity."

          >The Trinity</a
        >. "We shall first present the Scripture evidence on which the doctrine
        rests and then we shall present the credal statements and formulations
        that have been set forth by church councils and by individual thinkers as
        they have applied themselves to the interpretation of that evidence
        through the two thousand years of the Christian era."

          >The 5 Points Of Calvinism Explained</a
        >. "The Reformed Faith has held to the existence of an eternal, divine
        decree which, antecedently to any difference or desert in men themselves
        separates the human race into two portions and ordains one to everlasting
        life and the other to everlasting death."

          >The Reformed Faith</a
        >. "The purpose of this booklet is to set forth, in plain language and in
        terms easily understood, the basic differences between the Calvinistic
        (Reformed) and Arminian understanding of the Gospel, and to show what the
        Bible teaches concerning these subjects."

          >The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination</a
        >. "The purpose of this book is not to set forth a new system of
        theological thought, but to give a re-statement to that great system which
        is known as the Reformed Faith or Calvinism, and to show that this is
        beyond all doubt the teaching of the Bible and of reason."
