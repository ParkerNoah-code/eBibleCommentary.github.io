    <h2>1. Statement of the Doctrine</h2>
    <p>
      In the Westminster Confession the doctrine of Total Inability is stated as
      follows: — “Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all
      ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a
      natural man, being altogether averse from good, and dead in sin, is not
      able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself
      thereunto.” (Ch. IX, sec. IH.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul, Augustine, and Calvin have as their starting point the fact that all
      mankind sinned in Adam and that all men are “without excuse,” Rom. 2:1.
      Time and again Paul tells us that we are dead in trespasses and sins,
      estranged from God, and helpless. In writing to the Ephesian Christians he
      reminded them that before they received the Gospel they were “separate
      from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from
      the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the
      world,” 2:12. There we notice the five-fold emphasis as he piles phrase on
      top of phrase to stress this truth.

    <h2>2. The Extent and Effects of Original Sin</h2>
    <p>
      This doctrine of Total Inability, which declares that men are dead in sin,
      does not mean that all men are equally bad, nor that any man is as bad as
      he could be, nor that any one is entirely destitute of virtue, nor that
      human nature is evil in itself, nor that man's spirit is inactive, and
      much less does it mean that the body is dead. What it does mean is that
      since the fall man rests under the curse of sin, that he is actuated by
      wrong principles, and that he is wholly unable to love God or to do
      anything meriting salvation. His corruption is extensive but not
      necessarily intensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in this sense that man since the fall “is utterly indisposed,
      disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil.”
      He possesses a fixed bias of the will against God, and instinctively and
      willingly turns to evil. He is an alien by birth, and a sinner by choice.
      The inability under which he labors is not an inability to exercise
      volitions, but an inability to be willing to exercise holy volitions. And
      it is this phase of it which led Luther to declare that “Free-will is an
      empty term, whose reality is lost. And a lost liberty, according.to my
      grammar, is no liberty at all” (Bondage of the Will, p. 125). In matters
      pertaining to his salvation, the unregenerate man is not at liberty to
      choose between good and evil, but only to choose between greater and
      lesser evil, which is not properly free will. The fact that fallen man
      still has ability to do certain acts morally good in themselves does not
      prove that he can do acts meriting salvation, for his motives may be
      wholly wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man is a free agent but he cannot originate the love of God in his heart.
      His will is free in the sense that it is not controlled by any force
      outside of himself. As the bird with a broken wing is “free” to fly but
      not able, so the natural man is free to come to God but not able. How can
      he repent of his sin when he loves it? How can he come to God when he
      hates Him? This is the inability of the will under which man labors. Jesus
      said, “And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and
      men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil,”
      John 3:19; and again, “Ye will not come to me, that ye may have life,”
      John 5:40. Man’s ruin lies mainly in his own perverse will. He cannot come
      because he will not. Help enough is provided if he were only willing to
      accept it. Paul tells us, “The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it
      is not subject to the law of God^ neither indeed can it be. So they that
      are in the flesh cannot please God,” Rom. 8:7.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assume that because man has ability to love he therefore has ability to
      love God, is about as wise as to assume that since water has the ability
      to flow, it therefore has the ability to flow up hill; or to reason that
      because a man has power to cast himself from the top of a precipice to the
      bottom, he therefore has equal power to transport himself from the bottom
      to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen man sees nothing desirable in “the One who is altogether lovely,
      the fairest among ten thousand.” He may admire Jesus as a man, but he
      wants nothing to do with Him as God, and he resists the outward holy
      influences of the Spirit with all his power. Sin, and not righteousness,
      has become his natural element so that he has no desire for salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man’s fallen nature gives rise to a most obdurate blindness, stupidity,
      and opposition concerning the things of God. His will is under the control
      of a darkened understanding, which puts sweet for bitter, and bitter for
      sweet, good for evil, and evil for good. So far as his relations with God
      are concerned, he wills only that which is evil, although he wills it
      freely. Spontaneity and enslavement actually exist together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, fallen man is so morally blind that he uniformly prefers
      and chooses evil instead of good, as do the fallen angels or demons. When
      the Christian is completely sanctified he reaches a state in which he
      uniformly prefers and chooses good, as do the holy angels. Both of these
      states are consistent with freedom and responsibility of moral agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet while fallen man acts thus uniformly he is never compelled to sin, but
      does it freely and delights in it. His dispositions and desires are so
      inclined, and he acts knowingly and willingly from the spontaneous motion
      of the heart. This natural bias or appetite for that which is evil is
      characteristic of man’s fallen and corrupt nature, so that, as Job says,
      he “drinketh iniquity like water,” 16:16.
    </p>
    <p>
      We read that “The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, for
      they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, for they are
      spiritually discerned,” I Cor. 2:14. We are at a loss to understand how
      any one can take a plain common sense view of this passage of Scripture
      and yet contend for the doctrine of human ability. Man in his natural
      state cannot even see the kingdom of God, much less can he get into it. An
      uncultured person may see a beautiful work of art as an object of vision,
      but he has no appreciation of its excellence. He may see the figures of a
      complex mathematical equation, but they have no meaning for him. Horses
      and cattle may see the same beautiful sunset or other phenomenon in nature
      that men see, but they are blind to all of the artistic beauty. So it is
      when the Gospel of the cross is presented to the unregenerate man. He may
      have an intellectual knowledge of the facts and doctrines of the Bible,
      but he lacks all spiritual discernment of their excellence, and finds no
      delight in them. The same Christ is to one man without form or comeliness
      that he should desire Him; to another He is the Prince of life and the
      Savior of the world, God manifest in the flesh, whom it is impossible not
      to adore, love and obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      This total inability, however, arises not merely from a perverted moral
      nature, but also from ignorance. Paul wrote that the Gentiles “walk in the
      vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated
      from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of
      the hardening of their heart,” Eph. 4:17,18. And again, “The word of the
      cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is
      the power of God,” I Cor. 1:18. When he wrote of “Things which eye saw
      not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man,
      Whatsoever things God hath prepared for them that love Him,” he had
      reference, not to the glories of the heavenly state as is commonly
      supposed, but to the spiritual realities it this life which cannot be seen
      by the unregenerate mind, as is made plain by the words of the following
      verse: “But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit,” I Cor. 2:9, 10.
      On one occasion Jesus said, “No one knoweth the Son, save the Father;
      neither doth any know the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the
      Son willeth to reveal Him,” Matt. 11:27. Here we are plainly told that man
      in his unregenerate, unenlightened nature does not know God in any sense
      worthy the name, and that the Son is sovereign in choosing who shall come
      into this saving knowledge of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen man then lacks the power of spiritual discernment. His reason or
      understanding is blinded, and the taste and feelings are perverted. And
      since this state of mind is innate, as a condition of man’s nature, it is
      beyond the power of the wiil to change it. Rather it controls both the
      affections and volitions. The effect of regeneration is clearly taught in
      the divine commission which Paul received at his conversion when he was
      told that he was to be sent to the Gentiles “to open their eyes, that they
      might turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God,”
      Acts 26:18.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus taught the same truth under a different figure when He said to the
      Pharisees, “Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot
      hear my word. Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your
      father it is your will to do,” John 8:48, 44. They could not understand,
      nor even hear His words in any intelligible way. To them His words were
      only foolishness, madness; and they accused Him of being demon possessed
      (vss. 48, 62). Only His disciples could know the truth (vss. 81, 32); the
      Pharisees were children of the Devil (vss. 42, 44), and bondservants of
      sin (vs. 84), although they thought themselves free (vs. 33).
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time Jesus taught that a good tree could not bring forth evil
      fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit. And since in this similitude the good
      and evil trees represent good and evil men, what does it mean but that one
      class of men is governed by one set of basic principles, while the other
      class is governed by another set of basic principles? The fruits of these
      two trees are acts, words, thoughts, which if good proceed from a good
      nature, and if evil proceed from an evil nature. It is impossible, then,
      for one and the same root to bring forth fruit of different kinds. Hence
      we deny the existence in man of a power which may act either way, on the
      logical ground that both virtue and vice cannot come out of the same moral
      condition of the agent. And we affirm that human actions which relate to
      God proceed either out of a moral condition which necessarily produces
      good actions or out of a moral condition which necessarily produces evil
      actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the Epistle to the Ephesians Paul declares that prior to the
      quickening of the Spirit of God each individual soul lies dead in
      trespasses and sins. Now it will surely be admitted that to be dead, and
      to be dead in sin, is dear and positive evidence tbat there is ndther
      aptitude nor power r emaining for the performance of any spiritual action.
      If a man were deadi, in a natural and physical sense, it would at once be
      readily granted that there is no further possibility of that man being
      able to perform any physical actions. A corpse cannot act in any way
      whatever, and that man would be reckoned to have taken leave of his senses
      who asserted that it could. If a man is dead spiritually, therefore, it is
      surely equally as evident that he is nnahle to perform any spiritual
      actions, and thus the doctrine of man’s moral inability rests upon strong
      Scriptural evidence” (Warburton, Calvinism, p. 48).
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the prindple that no clean thing can come out of what is unclean (Job
      14:4), all that are bom of woman are declared ‘abominable and corrupt,’ to
      whose nature iniquity alone is attractive (Job 15:14-16). Accordingly, to
      become sinful, men do not wait until the age of accountable action
      arrives. Rather, they are apostates from the womb, and as soon as they are
      bom go astray, speaking lies (Ps. 58:3); they are even shapen in iniquity,
      and conceived in sin (Ps. 51:5). The propensity of their heart is evil
      from their youth (Gen. 8:21), and it is out of the heart that all the
      issues of life proceed (Prov. 4:23; 20:11). Acts of sin are therefore but
      the expression of the natural heart, which is deceitful above all things
      and exceedingly corrupt (Jer. 17:9).” (Warfield, Biblical Doctrines, p.
      440).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel presents this same truth in graphic language and gives us the
      picture of the helpless infant which wa's cast out in its blood and left
      to die, but which the Lord graciously found and cared for (Ch. 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of original sin supposes that fallen men have the same kind
      and degree of liberty in sinning under the influence of a corrupt nature
      as have the Devil and the demons, or that the saints in glory and the holy
      angels have in acting rightly under the influence of a holy nature. That
      is, men and angels act according to their natures. As the saints and
      angels are confirmed in holinessi, — that is, possessed of a nature which
      is wholly inclined to righteousness and adverse to sin, — so the nature of
      fallen men and of demons is such that they cannot perform a single act
      with right motives toward God. Hence the necessity that God shall
      sovereignly change the person’s character in regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Testament ceremonies of circumcision of the new-born child, and of
      purification of the mother, were designed to teach that man comes into the
      world sinful, that since the fall human nature is corrupt in its very
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul stated this truth in another and, if possible, even stronger way in
      II Cor. 4:3, 4: “And if our Gospel is veiled it is veiled to them that
      perish; in whom the god of this world (by which he means the Devil) hath
      blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Gospel of the
      glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them.” In a
      word, then, fallen men without the operations of the Spirit of God, are
      under the rule of Satan. They are led captive by him at his will, II Tim.
      2:26. So long as this “strong man fully armed” is not molested by the
      “stronger than he,” he keeps his kingdom in peace and his captives
      willingly do his bidding. But the “stronger than he” has overcome him, has
      taken his armor from him, and has liberated a part of his captives (Luke
      11:21, 22). God now exercises the right of releasing whom He will; and all
      born- again Christians are ransomed sinners from that kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scriptures declare that fallen man is a captive, a willing slave to
      sin, and entirely unable to deliver himself from its bondage and
      corruption. He is incapahle of understanding, and much less of doing, the
      things of God. There is what we might term “the freedom of slavery,” — a
      state in which the subject is free only to do the will of his master,
      which in this case is sin. It was this to which Jesus referred when He
      said, “Every one that committeth sin is the bond- servant of sin,” John
      8:34.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such being the depth of man’s corruption, it is wholly beyond his own
      power to cleanse himself. His only hope of an amendment of life lies
      accordingly in a change of heart, which change is brought about by the
      sovereign re-creative power of the Holy Spirit who works when and where
      and how He pleases. As well might one attempt to pump a leaking ship while
      the leak is still unmended, as to reform the unregenerate without this
      inward change. Or as well might the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
      leopard his spots, as he who is accustomed to do evil correct his ways.
      This transfer from spiritual death to spiritual life we call
      “regeneration.” It is referred to in Scripture by various terms:
      “regeneration,” a “making alive,” a “calling out of darkness into light,”
      a “quickening,” a “renewing,” a taking away of the heart of stone and
      giving the heart of flesh, etc., which work is exclusively that of the
      Holy Spirit. As a result of this change a man comes to see the truth and
      gladly accepts it. His very instincts and intimate impulses are
      transferred to the side of law, obedience to which becomes but the
      spontaneous expression of his nature. Regeneration is said to be wrought
      by that same supernatural power which God wrought in Christ when He raised
      Him from the dead (Eph. 1:18-20). Man does not possess the power of
      self-regeneration, and until this inward change takes place, he cannot be
      convinced of the truth of the Gospel by any amount of external testimony.
      “If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
      if one rise from the dead.”

    <h2>3. The Defects in Man’s Common Virtues</h2>
    <p>
      The unregenerate man can, through common grace, love his family and he may
      be a good citizen. He may give a million dollars to build a hospital, but
      he cannot give even a cup of cold water to a disciple in the name of
      Jesus. If a drunkard, he may abstain from drink for utilitarian purposes,
      but he cannot do it out of love for God. All of his common virtues or good
      works have a fatal defect in that his motives which prompt them are not to
      glorify God, — a defect so vital that it throws any element of goodness as
      to man wholly into the shade. It matters not how good the works may be in
      themselves, for so long as the doer of them is out of harmony with God,
      none of his works are spiritually acceptable. Furthermore, the good works
      of the unregenerate have no stable foundation, for his nature is still
      unchanged; and as naturally and as certainly as the washed sow returns to
      her wallowing in the mire, so he sooner or later returns to his evil ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the realm of morals it is a rule that the morality of the man must
      precede the morality of the action. One may speak with the tongues of men
      and of angels; yet if he is lacking that inward principle of love toward
      God, he is become as sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. He may give all
      his goods to feed the poor, and may give his body to be burned; yet if he
      lacks that inward principle, it profits him nothing. As human beings we
      know that an act of service rendered to us (by whatever utilitarian
      motives prompted) by someone who is at heart our enemy, does not merit our
      love and approbation. The Scripture statement that “Without faith it is
      impossible to be well-pleasing unto God,” fin ds its explanation in this,
      that faith is the foundation of all the other virtues, and nothing is
      acceptable to God which does not flow from right feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moral act is to be judged by the standard of love to God, which love is,
      as it were, the soul of all other virtue, and which is bestowed upon us
      only through grace. Augustine did not deny the existence of natural
      virtues, such as moderation, honesty, generosity, which constitute a
      certain merit among men; but he drew a broad line of distinction between
      these and the specific Christian graces (faith, love and gratitude to God,
      etc.), which alone are good in the strict sense of the word, and which
      alone have value before God.
    </p>
    <p>
      This distinction is very plainly illustrated in an example given by W. D.
      Smith. Says he: “In a gang of pirates we may find many things that are
      good in themselves. Though they are in wicked rebellion against the laws
      of the government, they have their own laws and regulations, which they
      obey strictly. We find among them courage and fidelity, with many other
      things that will recommend them as pirates. They may do many things, too,
      which the laws of the government require, but they are not done because
      the government has so required, but in obedience to their own regulations.
      For instance, the government requires honesty, and they may be strictly
      honest, one with another, in their transactions, and the division of all
      their spoil. Yet, as respects the government, and the general principle,
      their whole life is one of the most wicked dishonesty. Now, it is plain,
      that while they continue in their rebellion they can do nothing to
      recommend them to the government as citizens. Their first step must be to
      give up their rebellion, acknowledge their allegiance to the government,
      and! sue for mercy. So all men, in their natural state, are rebels against
      God; and though they may do many things which the law of God requires, and
      which will recommend them as men, yet nothing is done with reference to
      God and His law. Instead, the regulations of society, respect for public
      opinion, self-interest, their own character in the sight of the world, or
      some other worldly or wicked motive, reigns supremely; and God, to whom
      they owe their heart and fives, is forgotten; or, if thought of at all.
      His claims are wickedly rejected. His counsels spumed, and the heart, in
      obstinate rebellion, refuses obedience. Now it is plain that while the
      heart continues in this state the man is a rebel against God, and can do
      nothing to recommend him to His favor. The first step is to give up his
      rebellion, repent of his sins, turn to God, and sue for pardon and
      reconciliation through the Savior. T his he is unwilling to do, until he
      is made willing. He loves his sins, and will continue to love them, until
      his heart is changed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The good actions of unregenerate men, Smith continues, “are not positively
      sinful in themselves, but sinful from defect. They lack the principle
      which alone can make them righteous in the sight of God. In the case of
      the pirates it is easy to see that all their actions are sin against the
      government. While they continue pirates, their sailing, mending, or
      rigging the vessel, and even their eating and drinking, are all sins in
      the eyes of the government, as they are only so many expedients to enable
      them to continue their piratical career, and are parts of their fife of
      rebellion. So with sinners. 'While the heart is wrong, it vitiates
      everything in the sight of God, even their most ordinary occupations; for
      the plain, unequivocal language of God is, *Even the lamp of the wicked',
      is sin,' Prov. 21:4” (What is Calvinism, pp. 125-127).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this inability which the Scriptures teach when they declare that
      “They that are in the flesh cannot please God’ Rom. 8:8; “Whatsoever is
      not of faith is sin’ Rom. 14:28; and “Without faith it is impossible to be
      well-pleasing to Him’ Heb. 11:6. Hence even the virtues of the
      unregenerate man are but as plucked and fading flowers. It was because of
      this that Jesus said to His disciples, “Except your righteousness shall
      exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise
      enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And because those virtues are of this
      nature, they are only temporary. The one who possesses them is like the
      seed which falls on the stony soil, which perhaps springs up with promise
      of fruitage, but soon withers in the sun because it has no root in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows also from what has been said that salvation is ABSOLUTELY AND
      SOLELY OF GRACE, — that God is free, in consistency with the infinite
      perfections of His nature, to save none, few, many, or all, according to
      the sovereign good pleasure of His will. It also follows that salvation is
      not based on any merits in the creature, and that it depends on God, and
      not on men, who are, and who are not, to be made partakers of eternal
      life. God acts as a sovereign in saving some and passing by others who are
      left to the just recompense of their sins. Sinners are compared to dead
      men, or even to dry bones in their entire helplessness. In this they are
      all alike. The choice of some to eternal life is as sovereign as if Christ
      were to pass through a graveyard and bid one here and another there to
      come forth, the reason for restoring one to life and leaving another in
      his grave could be found only in His good pleasure, and not in the dead
      themselves. Hence the statement that we are foreordained according to the
      good pleasure of His will, and not after the good inclinations of our own;
      and in order that we might be holy, not because we were holy (Eph. 1:4,
      5). “Since all men alike deserved only God’s wrath and curse, the gift of
      His only begotten Son to die in the stead of malefactors, as the only
      possible method of expiating their guilt, is the most stupendous
      exhibition of undeserved favor and personal love that the universe has
      ever witnessed” (A. A. Hodge, pamphlet, Presbyterian Doctrine, p. 23).

    <h2>4. The Fall of Man</h2>
    <p>
      The fall of the human race into a state of sin and misery is the basis and
      foundation of the scheme of redemption which is set forth in the
      Scriptures, as it is the basis and foundation of the system which we
      teach. Only Calvinists seem to take the doctrine of the fall very
      seriously. Yet the Bible from beginning to end declares that man is ruined
      — totally r uin ed — that he is in a state of guilt and depravity from
      which he is utterly unable to deliver himself, and that God might in
      justice have left him to perish. In the Old Testament the narrative
      concerning the fall is found in the third chapter of Genesis; and in the
      New Testament direct references are madie to it in Romans 5;12-21; I Cor.
      15.22; II Cor. 11:3; I Tim. 2:13,14, etc., although the New Testament
      emphasizes not the historic fact that man fell, but the ethical fact that
      he is fallen. The New Testament writers interpreted it literally and based
      their theology upon it. To Paul Adam was as real as Christ, the fall as
      real as the atonement. It may be maintained that the apostles were in
      error, but that this was their position cannot be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. A. A. Hodge has given us a very good statement of the doctrine of the
      fall which we shall take the privilege of quoting: —
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a fair probation could not, in the nature of the case, be given to
      every new member in person as it comes into existence an undeveloped
      infant, God, as guardian of the race and for its best interests, gave all
      its members a trial in the person of Adam under the most favorable
      circumstances — making him for that end the representative and personal
      substitute of each one of his natural descendants. He formed with him a
      covenant of works and of life; i. e.. He gave to him for himself, and in
      behalf of all whom he represented, a promise of eternal life, conditioned
      upon perfect obedience, — that is, upon works. The obedience demanded was
      a specific test for a temporary period, which period of trial must
      necessarily be closed either by the reward consequent upon obedience, or
      the death consequent upon disobedience. The ‘reward’ promised was eternal
      life, which was a grace including far more than was originally bestowed
      upon Adam at his creation, the grant of which would have elevated the race
      into a condition of indefeasible holiness and happiness for ever. The
      ‘penalty* threatened and executed was death: ‘The day thou eatest thereof
      thou shalt surely die.* The nature of the death threatened can be
      determined only from a consideration of all that was involved in the curse
      actually inflicted. This we know to have included the instant withdrawal
      of the divine favor and spiritual intercommunion upon which man’s life
      depended. Hence the alienation and curse of God; the sense of guilt and
      corruption of nature; consequent actual transgressions, the miseries of
      life, the dissolution of the body, the pains of hell” (A. A. Hodge,
      pamphlet, Presbyterian Doctrine, pp. 19, 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of Adam’s sin are all comprehended under the term death,
      in its widest sense. Paul gives us the summary statement that “The wages
      of sin is death.” The full import of the death which was threatened to
      Adam can only be seen by considering all the evil consequences which have
      since befallen man. It was primarily spiritual death, or eternal
      separation from God, which was threatened; and physical death, or the
      death of the body, is but one of the first fruits and relatively
      unimportant consequences of that greater penalty. Adam did not die
      physically for 930 years after the fall, but he did die spiritually the
      very moment he fell into sin. He died just as really as the fish dies when
      taken from the water, or as the plant dies when taken from the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In general we cherish a very wrong idiea as to how Adam fell.... Adam was
      not tempted by Satan in a direct way .... Eve was tempted by Satan, and
      Eve fell, being deceived. But we have inspired evidence to prove that Adam
      was not deceived (I Tim. 2:14). He was caught by no wiles of Satan, but
      that which he did, he did wilfully and deliberately. And in the full
      consciousness of what he was doing, and with a perfect re aliz ation of
      the solemn consequences which were involved, he deliberately chose to
      follow his wife in her act of sinful disobedience. It was this deliberate
      wilfulness of man’s sin which constituted its heinous character. Had he
      been attacked by Satan, and forced to yield through some overwhelming
      power being brought against him, we might have tried to find some excuse
      for his fall. But when, with eyes wide open, and with mind perfectly
      conscious and fully aware of the awful nature of his act, he used his free
      will to respond to the claims of the creature in defiance of the Creator,
      no excuse can be found for his fall. His act, in reality, was wilful,
      defiant rebellion, and by it he openly transferred his allegiance from God
      to Satan” (Warburton, Calvinism, p. 34).
    </p>
    <p>
      And has there not been a fall — a fearful fall? The more we see of human
      nature as it is manifested in the world about us, the easier it is to
      believe in this great doctrine of original sin. Consider the world as a
      whole, filled as it is with murders, robberies, drunkenness, wars, broken
      homes, and crimes of all kinds. The thousand ingenious forms which crime
      and vice have assumed in the hands of regular practitioners are all tokens
      telling a fearful tale. A large portion of the human race today, as in all
      past ages, is left to live and die in the darkness of heathenism,
      hopelessly astray from God. Modernism and denial of every kind is rampant
      even in the Church. Even the religious press, so called, is strongly
      tinged with unbelief. Observe the general disinclination to pray, or to
      study the Bible, or to speak of spiritual things. Is not man now, as his
      progenitor Adam, fleeing from the presence of God, not wanting communion
      with Him, and with enmity in his heart for his Creator? Surely man’s
      nature is radically wrong. The daily newspaper accounts of events, even in
      such an enlightened land as America, show that man is sinful, lost from
      God, and actuated by unholy principles. And the only adequate explanation
      of all this is that the penalty of death, which was threatened on man
      before the fall, now rests on the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      We live in a lost world, a world which if left to itself would fester in
      its corruption from eternity to eternity, — a world reeking with iniquity
      and blasphemy. The effects of the fall are such that man’s wifl in itself
      tends only downward to acts of sin and folly. As a matter of fact God does
      not permit the race to become as corrupt as it naturally would if left to
      itself. He exercises restraining influences, inciting men to love one
      another, to be honest, philanthropic, and considterate of each other’s
      welfare. Unless God exercised these influences, wicked men would become
      worse and worse, overlapping conventions and social barriers, until the
      very zenith of lawlessness would soon be reached, and the earth would
      become so utterly corrupt that the elect could not live on it.

    <h2>5. The Representative Principle</h2>
    <p>
      It is easy for us to understand! how a person may act through a
      representative. The people of a state act in and through their
      representatives in the Legislature. If a country has a good president or
      king, all of the people share the good results; if a bad president or
      king, all suffer the consequences. In a very real sense parents stand
      representative for, and to a large extent decide the destinies of, their
      children. If the parents are wise, virtuous, thrifty, the children reap
      the blessings; but if they are indolent and immoral the children suffer.
      In a thousand ways the well-being of individuals is conditioned by the
      acts of others, so inwrought is this representative principle into our
      human life. Hence in the Scripture doctrine that Adam stood as the
      official head and representative of his people we have only the
      application of a principle which we see at work all about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Charles Hodge has very ably treated this subject in the following
      section: —
    </p>
    <p>
      “This representative principle pervades the whole Scriptures. The
      imputation of Adam’s sin to his posterity is not an isolated fact. It is
      only an illustration of a general principle which characterizes the
      dispensations of God from the beginning of the world. God declared Himself
      to Moses as one who visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
      and upon the children’s children unto the third and to the fourth
      generation, Ex. 34:6, 7 ... . The curse pronounced on Canaan fell on his
      posterity. Esau’s selling his birthright, shut out his descendants from
      the covenant of promise. The children of Moab and Ammon were excluded from
      the congregation of the Lord forever, because their ancestors opposed the
      Israelites when they came out of Egypt. In the case of Dathan and Abiram,
      as in that of Achan, ‘their wives, and their sons, and their little
      children’ perished for the sins of their parents. God said to Eli, that
      the iniquity of his house should not be purged with sacrifice and offering
      for ever. To David it was said, ‘The sword shall never depart from thy
      house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
      Hittite to be thy wife.’ To the disobedient Gehazi it was said: ‘The
      leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever.’ The
      sin of Jeroboam and of the men of his generation determined the destiny of
      the ten tribes for all time. The imprecation of the Jews, when they
      demanded the crucifixion of Christ, ‘His blood be on us and on our
      children,’ still weighs down the scattered people of Israel.... This
      principle runs through the whole Scriptures. When God entered into
      covenant with Abraham, it was not for himself only but also for his
      posterity. They were bound by all the stipulations of the covenant. They
      shared its promises and its threatenings, and in hundreds of cases the
      penalty of disobedience came upon those who had no personal part in the
      transgressions. Children suffered equally with adults in the judgments,
      whether famine, pestilence, or war, which came upon the people for their
      sins .... And the' Jews to this day are suffering the penalty of the sins
      of their fathers for their rejection of Him of whom Moses and the prophets
      spoke. The whole plan of redemption rests on this same principle. Christ
      is the representative of His people, and on this ground their sins are
      imputed to Him and His righteousness to them .... No man who believes the
      Bible, can shut his eyes to the fact that it everywhere recognizes the
      representative character of parents, and that the dispensations of God
      have from the beginning been founded on the principle that the children
      bear the iniquities of their fathers. This is one of the reasons which
      infidels assign for rejecting the divine origin of the Scrip- times. But
      infidelity furnishes no relief. History is as full of this doctrine as the
      Bible is. The punishment of the felon involves his family in his disgrace
      and misery. The spendthrift and drunkard entail poverty and wretchedness
      upon all connected with them. There is no nation now existing on the face
      of the earth, whose condition for weal or woe is not largely determined by
      the character and conduct of their ancestors ... The idea of the transfer
      of guilt or of vicarious punishment lies at the foundation of all the
      expiatory offerings under the Old Testament, andl of the great atonement
      under the new dispensation. To bear sin, is in Scriptural language to bear
      the penalty of sin. The victim bore the sin of the offerer. Hands were
      imposed upon the head of the animal about to be slaughtered, to express
      the transfer of guilt. That animal must be free from all defect or blemish
      to make it the more apparent that its blood was shed not for is own
      deficiencies but for the sin of another. All this was symbolical and
      typical.... And this is what the Scriptures teach concerning the Atonement
      of Christ. He bore our sins; He was made a curse for us; He suffered the
      penalty of the law in our stead. All this proceeds on the ground that the
      sins of one man can be justly, on some adequate ground, imputed to
      another” (Systematic Theology, II, pp. 198, 199, 201).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scriptures tell us that, “By one man’s disobedience the many were made
      sinners,” Rom. 5:19. “Through one man sin entered into the world!, and
      death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned,”
      Rom. 5:12. “Through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to
      condemnation” Rom. 5:18. If this does not prove that all men are condemned
      on account of the sin of Adam, language has no meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam was made not only the father but also the representative of the whole
      human race. And! if we fully understood the closeness of the relation
      between' him and them we would fully realize the justice of the
      transmission of his sin to them. Adam’s sin is imputed to his descendants
      in the same way that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to those who
      believe in Him. Adam’s descendants are, of course, no more personally
      guilty of his sin than Christ’s redeemed! are personally meritorious of
      His righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffering and death are declared to be the consequence of sin; and the
      reason that all die is that “all sinned.” Now we know that many suffer and
      die in infancy, before they have committed any sin themselves. It follows
      that either God is unjust in punishing the innocent, or that those infants
      are in some way guilty creatures. Andl if guilty, how have they sinned? It
      is impossible to explain it on any other supposition than that they sinned
      in Adam (I Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12, 18); and they could not have sinned in
      him in any other way than by representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while we are not personally guilty of Adam’s sin, we are,
      nevertheless, liable to punishment for it. “The guilt of Adam’s public
      sin,” says Dr. A. A. Hodge, “is by a judicial act of God immediately
      charged to the account of each and every one of his descendants from the
      moment he begins to exist, and antecedently to any act of his own. Hence
      all men come into existence deprived of all those influences of the Holy
      Spirit upon which their moral and spiritual life depends .... and with an
      antecedent prevailing tendency in their natures to sin; which tendency in
      them is itself of the nature of sin, and worthy of punishment. Human
      nature since the fall retains its constitutional faculties of reason,
      conscience and free agency, and hence man continues to be*a responsible
      moral agent. Yet he is spiritually dead, and totally averse to and
      incapable of the discharge of any of these duties which spring out of his
      relation to God, and entirely unable to change his own evil dispositions
      or innate moral tendencies, or to dispose himself to such a change, or to
      co-operate with the Holy Spirit in effecting such a change” (Presbyterian
      Doctrine, p. 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      And to the same general effect. Dr. R. L. Dabney, the outstanding
      theologian of the southern Presbyterian Church, says: “The explanation
      presented by the doctrine of imputation is demanded by all except
      Pelagians and Socinians. Man’s is a spiritually dead and a condemned!
      race. See Eph. 2:1-5, et passim. He is obviously under a curse for
      something, from the beginning of his life. Witness the native depravity of
      infants, and their inheritance of woe and death. Now, either man was tried
      and fell in Adam, or he has been condemned without trial. He is either
      under the curse (as it rests on him at the beginning of his existence) for
      Adam’s guilt, or for no guilt at all. Judge which is most honorable to
      God, a doctrine which, although a profound mystery, represents Him as
      giving man an equitable and most favored probation in his federal head; or
      that which makes God condemn him untried, and even before he exists”
      (Theology, p. 330).

    <h2>6. The Goodness and Severity of God</h2>
    <p>
      A survey of the fall and its extent is humiliating work. It proves to man
      that all his claims of goodness are unfounded, and it shows him that his
      only hope is in the sovereign grace of Almighty God. The “graciously
      restored ability” of which the Arminian talks is not consistent with the
      facts. The Scriptures, history, and Christian experience by no means
      warrant such a favorable view of the natural moral condition of man as the
      Arminian system teaches. On the contrary each of these gives us a very
      gloomy picture of a fearful corruption and universal inclination to evil,
      which can only be overcome by the intervention of divine grace. The
      Calvinistic system teaches a far deeper fall into sin and a far more
      glorious manifestation of redeeming grace. From these depths the Christian
      is led to despair of himself, to throw himself unconditionally into the
      arms of God, and to lay hold on unmerited grace, which alone can save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should see God's mercy and also His severity in the spiritual and
      physical realms. Life is full of hard facts which, unpleasant though they
      may be, must simply be admitted and faced. Throughout the Scriptures, and
      especially in the words of Christ Himself, the final torments of the
      wicked are described in such ways as to show us that they are
      indescribably awful. In the gospel of Matthew alone see 5:29, 30; 7:19;
      10:28; 11:21-24; 13:30, 41, 42, 49, 50; 18:8, 9, 34; 21:41; 22:14; 24:51;
      25:12, 30, 41; and 26:24. Surely a doctrine which received such emphasis
      from the lips of Christ Himself cannot be passed over in silence,
      distasteful though it may be. In the next world the wicked, with all
      restraint removed, will go headlong into sin, blaspheming and cursing God,
      growing worse and worse as they sink deeper and deeper into the bottomless
      pit. Endless punishment is the penalty of ENDLESS sinning. Furthermore, it
      is as much the glory of God that He punishes the wicked as that He rewards
      the righteous. Much of the easy-going indifference toward Christianity in
      our day is due to the failure of Christian ministers to emphasize these
      doctrines which Christ taught so repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the physical realm we see God’s severity in wars, famines, floods,
      disasters, diseases, sufferings, deaths, and crimes of all kind which come
      upon the just and the unjust alike. All of these exist in a world which is
      under the complete control of a God who is infinite in His perfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Behold then the goodness and severity of God,” Rom. 11:20. Naturalism
      does justice to neither of these. Armin- ianism magnifies the first but
      neglects the second!. Calvinism is the only system which does justice to
      both. It alone adequately sets forth the facts in regard to the eternal
      and infinite love of God which caused Him to provide redemption for His
      people, even at the great cost of sending His only- begotten Son to die on
      the cross; and also in regard to the awful abyss which exists between
      sinful man and! the holy God. It is true that “God is love,” but along
      with this must be placed the other statement that “our God is a consuming
      fire,” Heb. 12:29. Any system which omits or under-empha- sizes either of
      these truths will be a mutilated system, no matter how plausible it may
      sound to men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of the Total Inability of man is terribly stern, severe,
      forbidding. But it is to be remembered that we are not at liberty to
      develop a new system suited' to our liking. We must take the facts as we
      find them. Such exhibitions of the true state of mankind are, of course,
      offensive to unregenerate men generally; and many have tried to find out a
      system of doctrines more palatable to the popular mind. The state of
      fallen man is such that he readily listens to any theory which makes him
      even partly independent of God; he wishes to be the master of his fate
      andi the captain of his soul. The lost, ruined, and helpless state of the
      sinner needs to be constantly set before him; for until he is brought to
      feel it, he will never seek help where alone it is to be found. Poor man!
      truly carnal and sold under sin, not only without power but without
      inclination to move toward God; and what is more awful still, an actual
      rebel, a presumptuous, blasphemous rival of the Great Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine of Total Inability, or Original Sin, has been treated at
      some length in order to set forth the fundamental basis upon which the
      doctrine of Predestination rests. This side of the picture is dark, very
      dark indeed; but its supplement is the glory of God in redemption. Each of
      these truths must be seen in its true light before the other can be
      adequately appreciated.
