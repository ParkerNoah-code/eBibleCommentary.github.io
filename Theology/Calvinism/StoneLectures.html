    <h2>Calvinism a Life-System</h2>
    <p>
      A traveller from the old European Continent, disembarking on the shore of
      this New World, feels as the Psalmist says, that "his thoughts crowd upon
      him like a multitude". Compared with the eddying waters of your new stream
      of life, the old stream in which he was moving seems almost frostbound and
      dull; and here, on American ground, for the first time, he realizes how so
      many divine potencies, which were hidden away in the bosom of mankind from
      our very creation, but which our old world was incapable of developing,
      are now beginning to disclose their inward splendour, thus promising a
      still richer store of surprises for the Future.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would not, however, ask me to forget the superiority which, in many
      respects, the Old World may still claim, in your eyes, as well as in mine.
      Old Europe remains even now the bearer of a longer historical past, and
      therefore stands before us as a tree rooted more deeply, hiding between
      its leaves some more matured fruits of life. You are yet in your
      Springtide,—we are passing through our Fall;—and has not the harvest of
      Autumn an enchantment of its own?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though, on the other hand, I fully acknowledge the advantage you
      possess in the fact, that (to use another simile) the train of life
      travels with you so immeasureably faster than with us,—leaving us miles
      and miles behind,—still we both feel that the life in Old Europe is not
      some thing separate from life here; it is one and the same current of
      human existence that flows through both Continents.
    </p>
    <p>
      By virtue of our common origin, <em>you</em> may call us bone of your
      bone,—<em>we</em> feel that you are flesh of our flesh, and although you
      are outstripping us in the most discouraging way, you will never forget
      that the historic cradle of your wondrous youth stood in our old Europe,
      and was most gently rocked in my once mighty Fatherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, besides this common parentage, there is another factor which, in
      the face of even a wider difference, would continue to unite your
      interests and ours. Far more precious to us than even the development of
      human life, is the crown which ennobles it, and this noble crown of life
      for you and for me rests in the Christian name. That crown is our common
      heritage. It was not from Greece or Rome that the regeneration of human
      life came forth;—that mighty metamorphosis dates from Bethlehem and
      Golgotha; and if the Reformation, in a still more special sense, claims
      the love of our hearts, it is because it has dispelled the clouds of
      sacerdotalism, and has unveiled again to fullest view the glories of the
      Cross. But, in deadly opposition to this Christian element, against the
      very Christian name, and against its salutiferous influence in every
      sphere of life, the storm of Modernism has now arisen with violent
      intensity.
    </p>
    <p>In 1789 the turning point was reached.</p>
    <p>
      Voltaire's mad cry, "Down with the scoundrel" was aimed at Christ himself,
      but this cry was merely the expression of the most hidden thought from
      which the French Revolution sprang. The fanatic outcry of another
      philosopher, "We no more need a God", and the odious shibboleth "No God,
      no Master", of the Convention,—these were the sacrilegious watchwords
      which at that time heralded the liberation of man as an emancipation from
      all Divine Authority. And if, in His impenetrable wisdom, God employed
      that Revolution as a means by which to overthrow the tyranny of the
      Bourbons, and to bring a judgment on the princes who abused
      <em>His</em> nations as <em>their</em> footstool, nevertheless the
      principle of that Revolution remains thoroughly <em>anti-christian</em>,
      and has since spread like a cancer, dissolving and undermining all that
      stood firm and consistent before our Christian faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt than that Christianity is imperilled by great and
      serious dangers. Two <em>life systems</em> I) are wrestling one with
      another, in mortal combat. Modernism is bound to build a world of its own
      from the data of the natural man, and to construct man himself from the
      data of nature; while, on the other hand, all those who reverently bend
      the knee to Christ and worship Him as the Son of the Living God, and God
      himself, are bent upon saving the "Christian Heritage". This is
      <em>the</em> struggle in Europe, this is <em>the</em> struggle in America,
      and this also, is the struggle for principles in which my own country is
      engaged, and in which I myself have been spending all my energy for nearly
      forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this struggle Apologetics have advanced us not one single step.
      Apologetics have invariably begun by abandoning the assailed breastwork,
      in order to entrench themselves cowardly in a ravelin behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first therefore, I have always said to myself,—"If the battle is
      to be fought with honour and with a hope of victory, then
      <em>principle</em> must be arrayed against <em>principle</em>"; then it
      must be felt that in Modernism the vast energy of an all-embracing
      <em>life-system</em> assails us, then also it must be understood that we
      have to take our stand in a life-system of equally comprehensive and
      far-reaching power. And this powerful life-system is not to be invented
      nor formulated by ourselves, but is to be taken and applied as it presents
      itself in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      When thus taken, I found and confessed, and I still hold, that this
      manifestation of the Christian principle is given us in
      <em>Calvinism</em>. In Calvinism my heart has found rest. From Calvinism
      have I drawn the inspiration, firmly and resolutely to take my stand in
      the thick of this great conflict of principles. And therefore, when I was
      invited most honourably by your Faculty to give the
      <em>Stone</em>-Lectures here this year, I could not hesitate a moment as
      to my choice of subject. Calvinism, as the only decisive, lawful, and
      consistent defence for Protestant nations against encroaching, and
      overwhelming Modernism,—this of itself was bound to be my theme.
    </p>
    <p>Allow me therefore, in six lectures, to speak to you on Calvinism.</p>
    <p>
      1. On Calvinism as a life system,
      <br />
      2. On Calvinism and Religion,
      <br />
      3. On Calvinism and Politics,
      <br />
      4. On Calvinism and Science,
      <br />
      5. On Calvinism and Art,
      <br />
      6. On Calvinism and the Future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearness of presentation demands that in this first lecture I begin by
      fixing the <em>conception</em> of Calvinism <em>historically</em>. To
      prevent misunderstanding we must first know what we should not, and what
      we should, understand by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting therefore from the current use of the term, I find that this is
      by no means the same in different countries and in different spheres of
      life. The name Calvinist is used in our times first as a
      <em>sectarian</em> name. This is not the case in Protestant, but in Roman
      Catholic countries, especially in Hungary and France. In Hungary the
      Reformed Churches have a membership of some two and a-half millions, and
      in both the Romish and Jewish press of that country her members are
      constantly stigmatized by the non-official name of "Calvinists", a
      derisive name applied even to those who have divested themselves of all
      traces of sympathy with the faith of their fathers. The same phenomenon
      presents itself in France, especially in the Southern parts, where
      "Calviniste" is equally, and even more emphatically, a sectarian stigma,
      which does not refer to the faith or confession of the stigmatized person,
      but is simply put upon every member of the Reformed Churches, even though
      he be an atheist.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Thiebaud, known for his anti-Semitic propaganda, has at the same
      time revived the anti-Calvinistic spirit in France, and even in the
      Dreyfus-case, "Jews and Calvinists" were arraigned by him as the two
      anti-national forces, prejudicial to the "esprit gaulois".—Directly
      opposed to this is the <em>second</em> use of the word Calvinism, and this
      I call the confessional one. In this sense, a Calvinist is represented
      exclusively as the outspoken subscriber to the dogma of fore-ordination.
      They who disapprove of this strong attachment to the doctrine of
      predestination cooperate with the Romish polemists, in that by calling you
      "Calvinist", they represent you as a victim of dogmatic narrowness; and
      what is worse still, as being dangerous to the real seriousness of moral
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a stigma so conspicuously offensive that theologians like Hodge,
      who from fulness of conviction were open defenders of Predestination, and
      counted it an honor to be Calvinists, were nevertheless so deeply
      impressed with the disfavour attached to the "Calvinistic name", that for
      the sake of commending their conviction, they prefered to speak rather of
      Augustinianism than of Calvinism.—The
      <em>denominational</em> title of some Baptists and Methodists indicates a
      <em>third</em>
      use of the name Calvinist. No less a man than Spurgeon belonged to a class
      of Baptists who in England call themselves "Calvinistic Baptists", and the
      Whitefield Methodists in Wales to this day bear the name of "Calvinistic
      Methodists".
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus here also it indicates in some way a confessional difference, but is
      applied as the name for special church-denominations. Without doubt this
      practice would have been most severely criticized by Calvin himself During
      his life-time, no Reformed Church ever dreamed of naming the Church of
      Christ after any man. The Lutherans have done this, the Reformed Churches
      never.—But beyond this sectarian, confessional, and denominational use of
      the name "Calvinist", it serves moreover, in the <em>fourth</em> place, as
      a <em>scientific</em> name, either in an historical, philosophical or
      political sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, the name of Calvinism indicates the channel in which the
      Reformation moved, so far as it was neither Lutheran, nor Anabaptist nor
      Socinian. In the philosophical sense, we understand by it that system of
      conceptions which, under the influence of the master-mind of Calvin raised
      itself to dominance in the several spheres of life. And as a political
      name, Calvinism indicates that political movement which has guaranteed the
      liberty of nations in constitutional statesmanship; first in Holland, then
      in England, and since the close of the last century in the United States.
      In this scientific sense, the name of Calvinism is especially current
      among German scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fact that this not only is the opinion of those who are themselves
      of Calvinistic sympathies, but that also scholars who have abandoned every
      confessional standard of Christianity, nevertheless assign this profound
      significance to Calvinism, appears from the testimony borne by three of
      our best men of science, the first of whom, Dr. Robert Fruin, declares
      that: "Calvinism came into the Netherlands consisting of a logical system
      of divinity, of a democratic Church-order of its own, impelled by a
      severely-moral sense, and as enthusiastic for the moral as for the
      religious reformation of mankind", 1) Another historian, who was even more
      outspoken in his rationalistic sympathies, writes: "Calvinism is the
      highest form of development reached by the religious and political
      principle in the i6th century" 2). And a third authority acknowledges that
      Calvinism has liberated Switzerland, the Netherlands, and England, and in
      the Pilgrim Fathers has provided the impulse to the prosperity of the
      United States, 3) Similarly Bancroft, among you, acknowledged that
      Calvinism "has a theory of ontology, of ethics, of social happiness, and
      of human liberty, all derived from God". 4) Only in this last-named,
      strictly scientific sense do I desire to speak to you on Calvinism as an
      independent general tendency, which from a mother-principle of its own,
      has developed an independent form both for our <em>life</em> and for our
      <em>thought</em>
      among the nations of Western Europe and North America, and at present even
      in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of Calvinism is indeed far broader than the narrow confessional
      interpretation would lead us to suppose. The aversion to naming the Church
      after a man gave rise to the fact, that though in France the Protestants
      were called "Huguenots", in the Netherlands "Beggars", in Great Britain
      "Puritans" and "Presbyterians", and in North America "Pilgrim Fathers",
      yet all these products of the Reformation which on your Continent and ours
      bore the special Reformed type, were of Calvinistic origin. But the extent
      of the Calvinistic domain should not be limited to these purer
      revelations. Nobody applies such an exclusive rule to Christianity. Within
      its boundaries we embrace not only Western Europe, but also Russia, the
      Balkan States, the Armenians, and even Menelik's empire in Abyssinia.
      Therefore it is but just that in the same way we should include in the
      Calvinistic fold those churches also which have diverged more or less from
      its purer forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her XXXIX Articles, the Church of England is strictly Calvinistic, even
      though in her Hierarchy and Liturgy she has abandoned the straight paths,
      and has met with the serious results of this departure in Puseyism and
      Ritualism. The Confession of the Independents was equally Calvinistic,
      even though in their conception of the Church the organic structure was
      broken by individualism. And if under the leadership of Wesley most
      Methodists became opposed to the theological interpretation of Calvinism,
      it is nevertheless the Calvinistic spirit itself that created this
      spiritual reaction against the pertrifying church-life of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a given sense therefore it may be said, that the entire field which in
      the end was covered by the Reformation, so far as it was not Lutheran and
      not Socinian, was dominated in principle by Calvinism. Even the Baptists
      applied for shelter at the tents of the Calvinists. It is the free
      character of Calvinism that accounts for the rise of these several shades
      and differences, and of the reactions against their excesses. By its
      hierarchy, Romanism is and remains uniform. Lutheranism owes its similar
      unity and uniformity to the ascendency of the prince, whose relation to
      the Church is that of "summus episcopus" and to its "ecclesia docens".
    </p>
    <p>
      Calvinism on the other hand, which sanctions no ecclesiastical hierarchy,
      and no magisterial interference, could not develop itself except in many
      and varied forms and deviations, thereby of course incurring the danger of
      degeneration, provoking in its turn all kind of onesided reactions. With
      the free development of life, such as was intended by Calvinism, the
      distinction could not fail to appear between a <em>centre</em>, with its
      fulness and purity of vitality and strength, and the broad
      <em>circumference</em> with its threatening declensions. But in that very
      conflict between a purer <em>centre</em> and a less pure
      <em>circumference</em> the steady working of its spirit was guaranteed to
      Calvinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus understood, Calvinism is rooted in a form of religion which was
      peculiarly its own, and from this specific religious consciousness there
      was developed first a peculiar theology, then a special church-order, and
      then a given form for political and social life, for the interpretation of
      the moral world-order, for the relation between nature and grace, between
      Christianity and the world, between church and state, and finally for art
      and science; and amid all these life-utterances it remained always the
      self-same Calvinism, in so far as simultaneouly and spontaneously all
      these developments sprang from its deepest life-principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence to this extent it stands in line with those other great
      <em>complexes</em> of human life, known as Paganism, Islamism and
      Romanism, by which we distinguish four entirely different worlds in the
      one collective world of human life. And if, speaking precisely, you should
      coordinate Christianity and not Calvinism with Paganism and Islamism, it
      is nevertheless better to place Calvinism in line with them, because
      Calvinism claims to embody the Christian idea more purely and accurately
      than could Romanism and Lutheranism. In the Greek world of Russia and the
      Balkan States, the national element is still dominant, and therefore the
      Christian faith in these countries has not yet been able to produce a form
      of life of its own from the root of its mystical orthodoxy. In Lutheran
      countries, the interference of the magistrate has prevented the free
      working of the spiritual principle. Hence of Romanism only can it be said,
      that it has embodied its life-thought in a world of conceptions and
      utterances entirely its own. But by the side of Romanism, and in
      opposition to it, Calvinism made its appearance, not merely to create a
      different Church-form, but an entirely different form for human life, to
      furnish human society with a different method of existence, and to
      populate the world of the human heart with different ideals and
      conceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this had not been realised until our time, and is now acknowledged by
      friend and enemy in consequence of a better study of history, should not
      surprise us. This would not have been the case, if Calvinism had entered
      life as a well-constructed system, and had presented itself as an outcome
      of study. But its origin came about in an entirely different way. In the
      order of existence, life is first. And to Calvinism life itself was ever
      the first object of its endeavours. There was too much to do and to suffer
      to devote much time to study. What was dominant was Calvinistic practice
      at the stake and in the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover the nations among whom Calvinism gained the day,—such as the
      Swiss, the Dutch, the English and the Scotch—were by nature not very
      philosophically predisposed. Especially at that time, life among those
      nations was spontaneous and void of calculation; and only later on has
      Calvinism in its parts become a subject of that special study by which
      historians and theologians have traced the relation between Calvinistic
      phenomena and the all-embracing unity of its principle. It can even be
      said that the need of a theoretical and systematical study of so incisive
      and comprehensive a phenomenon of Hfe, only arises when its first vitality
      has been exhausted, and when for the sake of maintaining itself in the
      future, it is compelled to greater accuracy in the drawing of its boundary
      lines. And if to this you add the fact that the stress of reflecting our
      existence as a unity in the mirror of our consciousness, is far stronger
      in our philosophical age than it ever was before, it is readily seen that
      both the needs of the present, and the care for the future, compel us to a
      deeper study of Calvinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Roman Catholic Church everybody knows what he lives for, because
      with clear consciousness he enjoys the fruit of Rome's unity of life
      system. Even in Islam you find the same power of a conviction of life
      dominated by one principle. Protestantism alone wanders about in the
      wilderness without aim or direction, moving hither and thither, without
      making any progress. This accounts for the fact that among Protestant
      nations Pantheism, born from the new German Philosophy and owing its
      concrete evolution-form to Darwin, claims for itself more and more the
      supremacy in every sphere of human life, even in that of theology, and
      under all sorts of names tries to overthrow our Christian traditions, and
      is bent even upon exchanging the heritage of our fathers for a hopeless
      modern Buddhism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading thoughts that had their rise in the French Revolution at the
      close of the last, and in German philosophy in the course of the present
      century, form together a life-system which is diametrically opposed to
      that of our fathers. Their struggles were for the sake of the glory of God
      and a purified Christianity; the present movement wages war for the sake
      of the glory of man being inspired, not by the humble mind of Golgotha but
      by the pride of Hero-worship. And why did we, Christians, stand so weak,
      in the face of this Modernism? Why did we constantly lose ground. Simply
      because we were devoid of an equal unity of life-conception, such as alone
      could enable us with irresistible energy to repel the enemy at the
      frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unity of life-conception, however, is never to be found in a vague
      conception of Protestantism winding itself as it does in all kind of
      tortuosities, but you do find it in that mighty historic process, which as
      Calvinism dug a channel of its own for the powerful stream of its life. By
      this unity of conception alone as given in Calvinism, you in America and
      we in Europe might be enabled once more to take our stand, by the side of
      Romanism, in opposition to modern Pantheism. Without this unity of
      starting point and life-system we must lose the power to maintain our
      independent position, and our strength for resistance must ebb away.
