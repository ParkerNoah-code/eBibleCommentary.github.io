        <h2>The Doctrine of the Word of God</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="Purpose.html">Purpose</a>: The light of nature and the works
          of creation and providence clearly demonstrate the goodness, wisdom,
          and power of God, so that people have no excuse. However, these things
          are not sufficient to give the knowledge of God and his will that is
          necessary for salvation. Therefore, the Lord was pleased at various
          times and in various manners to reveal himself and to declare his will
          to his church. Everything we need to know about God's glory and our
          salvation, faith, and life is either explicitly stated in or
          necessarily inferred by the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Attributes.html">Attributes</a>: The Scriptures of the Old
          and New Testaments are the Word of God, written under the inspiration
          of the Holy Spirit, and are therefore infallible, and of divine
          authority in all things pertaining to faith and practice, and
          consequently free from all error whether of doctrine, fact, or
          precept. They are sufficiently perspicuous to be understood by the
          people, in the use of ordinary means and by the aid of the Holy
          Spirit, in all things necessary to faith or practice, without the need
          of any infallible interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Canon.html">Canon</a>: The Bible, the written Word of God,
          contain the Old and New Testaments. The books commonly called the
          Apocrypha were not inspired and are not part of the Bible canon.
          Therefore, they have no authority for the church of God and should be
          viewed and used as other merely human writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Proofs.html">Proofs</a>: The Bible does not depend upon the
          testimony of any person or church, but rather upon God, who is the
          author and is truth itself. Ultimately we believe the Bible because of
          the internal work of the Holy Spirit, who bears witness by and with
          the Bible in our hearts. However, there are proofs we can offer to
          establish the divine origin of the Bible: the testimony of the church,
          the heavenliness of its contents, the power of its teachings, the
          majesty of its style, the harmony of all its parts, the central focus
          on giving all glory to God, the full relevation of the only way to be
          saved, and many other incomparable qualities and complete perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="SolaScriptura.html">Rule of Faith</a>: The Bible contains all
          the extant revelations of God which He designed to be the rule of
          faith and practice for his Church; so that nothing can rightfully be
          imposed on the consciences of men as truth or duty which is not taught
          directly or by necessary implication in the Holy Scriptures. This
          excludes all unwritten traditions and decrees of the visible Church;
          all resolutions of conventions, or other public bodies, declaring this
          or that to be right or wrong, true or false.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Hermeneutics.html">Hermeneutics</a>: The words of Scripture
          are to be taken in the sense attached to them in the age and by the
          people to whom they were addressed. God cannot teach in one place
          anything which is inconsistent with what He teaches in another. Hence
          Scripture must explain Scripture. The Scriptures are to be interpreted
          under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which guidance is to be humbly
          and earnestly sought.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Translation.html">Translation</a>: The Old Testament was
          written in Hebrew, which was the native language of the Israelites.
          The New Testament was written in Greek, which was the most common
          language when it was written. These Testaments were inspired by God,
          and by God's care and providence they were preserved throughout
          history. Therefore, they are authentic and the church should appeal to
          them for all religious controversies. God's people have a right to,
          and desire to, read the Bible, and they are commanded to read the
          Bible in the fear of God and to search the Bible. Since not all
          Christians know these original languages, the Bible should be
          translated into the language of every nation they come to. This way,
          the Bible can dwell richly in everyone, and everyone can both worship
          God acceptably and have hope through the patience and comfort of the
          Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="TextualCriticism.html">Textual Criticism</a>: The Church has
          never held the verbal infallibility of our translations, nor the
          perfect accuracy of the copies of the original Hebrew and Greek
          Scriptures now possessed by us. These copies confessedly contain many
          "discrepancies" resulting from frequent transcription. While these
          variations hinder the interpretation of certain details, they neither
          involve the loss nor abate the evidence of a single essential fact or
          doctrine of Christianity. By the discovery and collation of more
          ancient and accurate copies, the Church is now in possession of a more
          perfect text of the original Scriptures than she has enjoyed since the
          apostolic age.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="Objections.html">Objections</a>: In connection with a
          divine-human work like the Bible, insoluble difficulties may be
          expected to present themselves. So long, however, as its inspiration
          is sustained by competent and sufficient evidence, these difficulties
          cannot justly prevent our full acceptance of the doctrine, any more
          than disorder and mystery in nature warrant us in setting aside the
          proofs of its divine authorship. These difficulties are lessened with
          time; some have already disappeared; many may be due to ignorance, and
          may be removed hereafter; those which remain may be intended to
          stimulate inquiry and to discipline faith.
