      >1833 New Hampshire Confession of Faith</a
    >:
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    This Confession was drawn up by the Rev. John Newton Brown, D. D., of New
    Hampshire about 1833, and was adopted by the New Hampshire Convention, and
    widely accepted by Baptists, especially in the Northern and Western States,
    as a clear and concise statement of their faith, in harmony with the
    doctrines of older confessions, but expressed in milder form. The text is
    taken from the Baptist Church Manual, published by the American Baptist
    Publication Society, Philadelphia.

  <h2>Declaration of Faith</h2>
  <p>
    Of the Scriptures We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely
    inspired, and is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction;<sup>1</sup>
    that it has God for its author, salvation for its end,<sup>2</sup> and truth
    without any mixture of error for its matter;<sup>3</sup> that it reveals the
    principles by which God will judge us;<sup>4</sup> and therefore is, and
    shall remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian
    union,<sup>5</sup> and the supreme standard by which all human conduct,
    creeds, and opinions should be tried.<sup>6</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the True God We believe that there is one, and only one, living and true
    God, an infinite, intelligent Spirit, whose name is JEHOVAH, the Maker and
    Supreme Ruler of Heaven and earth;<sup>7</sup> inexpressibly glorious in
    holiness,<sup>8</sup> and worthy of all possible honor, confidence, and
    love;<sup>9</sup> that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons,
    the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost;<sup>10</sup> equal in every divine
    perfection,<sup>11</sup> and executing distinct and harmonious offices in
    the great work of redemption.<sup>12</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Fall of Man We believe that man was created in holiness, under the
    law of his Maker;<sup>13</sup> but by voluntary transgression fell from that
    holy and happy state;<sup>14</sup> in consequence of which all mankind are
    now sinners,<sup>15</sup> not by constraint, but choice;<sup>16</sup> being
    by nature utterly void of that holiness required by the law of God,
    positively inclined to evil; and therefore under just condemnation to
    eternal ruin,<sup>17</sup> without defense or excuse.<sup>18</sup>
  </p>

    18. Ezek. 18:19-20; Rom. 1:20; 3:19; Gal. 3:22
  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Way of Salvation We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly
    of grace,<sup>19</sup> through the mediatorial offices of the Son of
    God;<sup>20</sup> who by the appointment of the Father, freely took upon him
    our nature, yet without sin;<sup>21</sup> honored the divine law by his
    personal obedience,<sup>22</sup> and by his death made a full atonement for
    our sins;<sup>23</sup> that having risen from the death, he is now enthroned
    in heaven;<sup>24</sup> and uniting in his wonderful person the tenderest
    sympathies with divine perfections, he is every way qualified to be a
    suitable, a compassionate, and an all- sufficient Saviour.<sup>25</sup>
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of Justification We believe that the great gospel blessing which Christ<sup
      >26</sup
    >
    secures to such as believe in him is Justification;<sup>27</sup> that
    Justification includes the pardon of sin,<sup>28</sup> and the promise of
    eternal life on principles of righteousness;<sup>29</sup> that it is
    bestowed, not in consideration of any works of righteousness which we have
    done, but solely through faith in the Redeemer's blood;<sup>30</sup> by
    virtue of which faith his perfect righteousness is freely imputed to us of
    God;<sup>31</sup> that it brings us into a state of most blessed peace and
    favor with God, and secures every other blessing needful for time and
    eternity.<sup>32</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Freeness of Salvation We believe that the blessings of salvation are
    made free to all by the gospel;<sup>33</sup> that it is the immediate duty
    of all to accept them by a cordial, penitent, and obedient faith;<sup
      >34</sup
    >
    and that nothing prevents the salvation of the greatest sinner on earth but
    his own inherent depravity and voluntary rejection of the gospel;<sup
      >35</sup
    >
    which rejection involves him in an aggravated condemnation.<sup>36</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of Grace in Regeneration We believe that, in order to be saved, sinners must
    be regenerated, or born again;<sup>37</sup> that regeneration consists in
    giving a holy disposition to the mind;<sup>38</sup> that it is effected in a
    manner above our comprehension by the power of the Holy Spirit, in
    connection with divine truth,<sup>39</sup> so as to secure our voluntary
    obedience to the gospel;<sup>40</sup> and that its proper evidence appears
    in the holy fruits of repentance, and faith, and newness of life.<sup

    John 5:4, 18
  </p>
  <p>
    Of Repentance and Faith We believe that Repentance and Faith are sacred
    duties, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the
    regenerating Spirit of God;<sup>42</sup> whereby being deeply convinced of
    our guilt, danger, and helplessness, and of the way of salvation by
    Christ,<sup>43</sup> we turn to God with unfeigned contrition, confession,
    and supplication for mercy;<sup>44</sup> at the same time heartily receiving
    the Lord Jesus Christ as our Prophet, Priest, and King, and relying on him
    alone as the only and all-sufficient Saviour.<sup>45</sup>
  </p>
  <p>

    1:12
  </p>
  <p>
    Of God's Purpose of Grace We believe that Election is the eternal purpose of
    God, according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves
    sinners;<sup>46</sup> that being perfectly consistent with the free agency
    of man, it comprehends all the means in connection with the end;<sup
      >47</sup
    >
    that it is a most glorious display of God's sovereign goodness, being
    infinitely free, wise, holy, and unchangeable;<sup>48</sup> that it utterly
    excludes boasting, and promotes humility, love, prayer, praise, trust in
    God, and active imitation of his free mercy;<sup>49</sup> that it encourages
    the use of means in the highest degree;<sup>50</sup> that it may be
    ascertained by its effects in all who truly believe the gospel;<sup>51</sup>
    that it is the foundation of Christian assurance;<sup>52</sup> and that to
    ascertain it with regard to ourselves demands and deserves the utmost
    diligence.<sup>53</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of Sanctification We believe that Sanctification is the process by which,
    according to the will of God, we are made partakers of his holiness;<sup
      >54</sup
    >
    that it is a progressive work;<sup>55</sup> that it is begun in
    regeneration;<sup>56</sup> and that it is carried on in the hearts of
    believers by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, the Sealer and
    Comforter, in the continual use of the appointed means--especially the Word
    of God, self-examination, self-denial, watchfulness, and prayer.<sup

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Perseverance of Saints We believe that such only are real believers
    as endure unto the end;<sup>58</sup> that their persevering attachment to
    Christ is the grand mark which distinguishes them from superficial
    professors;<sup>59</sup> that a special Providence watches over their
    welfare;<sup>60</sup> and they are kept by the power of God through faith
    unto salvation.<sup>61</sup>

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Harmony of the Law and the Gospel We believe that the Law of God is
    the eternal and unchangeable rule of his moral government;<sup>62</sup> that
    it is holy, just, and good;<sup>63</sup> and that the inability which the
    Scriptures ascribe to fallen men to fulfill its precepts arises entirely
    from their love of sin;<sup>64</sup> to deliver them from which, and to
    restore them through a Mediator to unfeigned obedience to the holy Law, is
    one great end of the Gospel, and of the means of grace connected with the
    establishment of the visible Church.<sup>65</sup>
  </p>

    62. Rom. 3:31; Matt. 5:17; Luke 16:17; Rom. 3:20; 4:15

    16:17-18; 1 Cor. 12:28
  </p>
  <p>
    Of a Gospel Church We believe that a visible Church of Christ is a
    congregation of baptized believers,<sup>66</sup> associated by covenant in
    the faith and fellowship of the gospel;<sup>67</sup> observing the
    ordinances of Christ;<sup>68</sup> governed by his laws,<sup>69</sup> and
    exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by his
    Word;<sup>70</sup> that its only scriptural officers are Bishops, or
    Pastors, and Deacons,<sup>71</sup> whose qualifications, claims, and duties
    are defined in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus.

  </p>
  <p>
    Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper We believe that Christian Baptism is the
    immersion in water of a believer,<sup>72</sup> into the name of the Father,
    and Son, and Holy Ghost;<sup>73</sup> to show forth, in a solemn and
    beautiful emblem, our faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Saviour,
    with its effect in our death to sin and resurrection to a new life;<sup
      >74</sup
    >
    that it is prerequisite to the privileges of a Church relation; and to the
    Lord's Supper,<sup>75</sup> in which the members of the Church, by the
    sacred use of bread and wine, are to commemorate together the dying love of
    Christ;<sup>76</sup> preceded always by solemn self- examination.<sup

  </p>
  <p>
    Of the Christian Sabbath We believe that the first day of the week is the
    Lord's Day, or Christian Sabbath;<sup>78</sup> and is to be kept sacred to
    religious purposes,<sup>79</sup> by abstaining from all secular labor and
    sinful recreations;<sup>80</sup> by the devout observance of all the means
    of grace, both private<sup>81</sup> and public;<sup>82</sup> and by
    preparation for that rest that remaineth for the people of God.<sup>83</sup>

    Of Civil Government We believe that civil government is of divine
    appointment, for the interests and good order of human society;<sup>84</sup>
    and that magistrates are to be prayed for, conscientiously honored and
    obeyed;<sup>85</sup> except only in things opposed to the will of our Lord
    Jesus Christ<sup>86</sup> who is the only Lord of the conscience, and the
    Prince of the kings of the earth.<sup>87</sup>

    Of the Righteous and the Wicked We believe that there is a radical and
    essential difference between the righteous and the wicked;<sup>88</sup> that
    such only as through faith are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
    sanctified by the Spirit of our God, are truly righteous in his esteem;<sup
      >89</sup
    >
    while all such as continue in impenitence and unbelief are in his sight
    wicked, and under the curse;<sup>90</sup> and this distinction holds among
    men both in and after death.<sup>91</sup>

    retribution;<sup>94</sup> that a solemn separation will then take place;<sup
