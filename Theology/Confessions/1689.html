    <h2>Preface. To the Judicious and Impartial Reader</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> Courteous Reader: It is now many years since divers of us (with
      other sober Christians then living, and walking in the way of the Lord,
      that we profess) did conceive ourselves to be under a necessity of
      publishing a Confession, of our Faith, for the information and
      satisfaction of those that did not thoroughly understand what our
      principles were, or had entertained prejudices against our profession, by
      reason of the strange representation of them by some men of note who had
      taken very wrong measures, and accordingly led others into misapprehension
      of us and them. And this was first put forth about the year 1643, in the
      name of seven congregations then gathered in London; since which time
      divers impressions thereof have been dispersed abroad, and our end
      proposed in good measure answered, inasmuch as many (and some of those men
      eminent both for piety and learning) were thereby satisfied that we were
      no way guilty of those heterodoxies and fundamental errors which had too
      frequently been charged upon us without ground or occasion given on our
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> And forasmuch as that Confession is not now commonly to be had,
      and also that many others have since embraced the same truth which is
      owned therein, it was judged necessary by us to join together in giving a
      testimony to the world of our firm adhering to those wholesome principles
      by the publication of this which is now in your hand. And forasmuch as our
      method and manner of expressing our sentiments in this doth vary from the
      former (although the substance of this matter is the same), we shall
      freely impart to you the reason and occasion thereof. One thing that
      greatly prevailed with us to undertake this work was (not only to give a
      full account of ourselves to those Christians that differ from us about
      the subject of baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence arise
      unto those that have any account of our labors in their instruction and
      establishment in the great truths of the Gospel, in the clear
      understanding and steady belief of which our comfortable walking with God,
      and fruitfulness before him in all our ways, is most nearly concerned; and
      therefore we did conclude it necessary to express ourselves the more fully
      and distinctly; and also to fix on such a method as might be most
      comprehensive of those things we designed to explain our sense and belief
      of; and finding no defect in this regard in that fixed on by the Assembly,
      and, after them by those of the congregational way, we did readily
      conclude it best to retain the same order in our present Confession; and
      also when we observed that those last mentioned did in their Confessions
      (for reasons which seemed of weight both to themselves and others) choose
      not only to express their mind in words concurrent with the former in
      sense concerning all those articles wherein they were agreed, but also for
      the most part without any variation of the terms, we did in like manner
      conclude it best to follow their example in making use of the very same
      words with them both in these articles (which are very many) wherein our
      faith and doctrine are the same with theirs; and this we did the more
      abundantly to manifest our consent with both in all the fundamental
      articles of the Christian religion, as also with many others whose
      orthodox Confessions have been published to the world on the behalf of the
      Protestant in diverse nations and cities. And also to convince all that we
      have no itch to clog religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in
      that form of sound words which hath been, in consent with the Holy
      Scriptures, used by others before us; hereby declaring, before God,
      angels, and men, our hearty agreement with them in that wholesome
      Protestant doctrine which, with so clear evidence of Scriptures, they have
      asserted. Some things, indeed, are in some places added, some terms
      omitted, and some few changed; but these alterations are of that nature as
      that we need not doubt any charge or suspicion of unsoundness in the faith
      from any of our brethren upon the account of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> In those things wherein we differ from others we have expressed
      ourselves with all candor and plainness, that none might entertain
      jealousy of aught secretly lodged in our breasts that we would not the
      world should be acquainted with; yet we hope we have also observed those
      rules of modesty and humility as will render our freedom in this respect
      inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments are different from ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture at the
      bottom, for the confirmation of each article in our Confession; in which
      work we have studiously endeavored to select such as are most clear and
      pertinent for the proof of what is asserted by us; and our earnest desire
      is that all into whose hands this may come would follow that (never enough
      commended) example of the noble Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily
      that they might find out whether the things preached to them were so or
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> There is one thing more which we sincerely profess and earnestly
      desire credence in - viz., that contention is most remote from our design
      in all that we have done in this matter; and we hope that the liberty of
      an ingenuous unfolding our principles and opening our hearts unto our
      brethren, with the Scripture grounds of our faith and practice will by
      none of them be either denied to us, or taken ill from us. Our whole
      design is accomplished if we may have attained that justice as to be
      measured in our principles and practice, and the judgment of both by
      others, according to what we have now published, which the Lord (whose
      eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to be the doctrine which with our
      hearts we most firmly believe and sincerely endeavor to conform our lives
      to. And O that, other contentions being laid asleep, the only care and
      contention of all upon whom the name of our blessed Redeemer is called
      might for the future be to walk humbly with their God in the exercise of
      all love and meekness toward each other, to perfect holiness in the fear
      of the Lord, each one endeavoring to have his conversation such as
      becometh the gospel; and also, suitable to his place and capacity,
      vigorously to promote in others the practice of true religion and
      undefiled in the sight of God our Father! And that in this backsliding day
      we might not spend our breath in fruitless complaints of the evils of
      others, but may every one begin at home, to reform in the first place our
      own hearts and ways, and then to quicken all that we may have influence
      upon to the some work, that if the will of God were so, none might deceive
      themselves by resting in and trusting to a form of godliness without the
      power of it, and inward experience of the efficacy of those truths that
      are professed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of
      religion in our day which we cannot but touch upon and earnestly urge a
      redress of, and that is the neglect of the worship of God in families by
      those to whom the charge and conduct of them is committed. May not the
      gross ignorance and instability of many, with the profaneness of others,
      be justly charged upon their parents and masters, who have not trained
      them up in the way wherein they ought to walk when they were young, but
      have neglected those frequent and solemn commands which the Lord hath laid
      upon them, so to catechise and instruct them that their tender years might
      be seasoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as revealed in the
      Scriptures; and also by their own omission of prayer and other duties of
      religion of their families, together with the ill example of their loose
      conversation, having, inured them first to a neglect and the contempt of
      all piety and religion? We know this will not excuse the blindness and
      wickedness of any, but certainly it will fall heavy upon those that have
      been thus the occasion thereof; they indeed die in their sins, but will
      not their blood be required of those under whose care they were, who yet
      permitted them to go on without warning - yea, led them into the paths of
      destruction? And will not the diligence of Christians with respect to the
      discharge of these duties in ages past rise up in judgment against and
      condemn many of those who would be esteemed such now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.</b> We shall conclude with our earnest prayer that the God of all
      grace will pour out those measures of his Holy Spirit upon us, that the
      profession of truth may be accompanied with the sound belief and diligent
      practice of it by us, that his name may in all things be glorified through
      Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

    <h2>Chapter 1. Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and
      infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.<sup>1</sup>
      Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do
      so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men
      inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and
      his will which is necessary unto salvation.<sup>2</sup> Therefore it
      pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself,
      and to declare that his will unto his church;<sup>3</sup> and afterward
      for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more
      sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the
      flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same
      wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most
      necessary, those former ways of God&#x27;s revealing his will unto his
      people being now ceased.<sup>4</sup>

    </p>
    <p>5. 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
      inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and,
      therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any
      otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.<sup>6</sup>
    </p>
    <p>6. Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
      believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but
      wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is
      to be received because it is the Word of God.<sup>7</sup>
    </p>
    <p>7. 2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9</p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of
      God to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the
      heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty
      of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which
      is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way
      of man&#x27;s salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and
      entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly
      evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full
      persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority
      thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and
      with the Word in our hearts.<sup>8</sup>
    </p>
    <p>8. John 16:13-14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27</p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his
      own glory, man&#x27;s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set
      down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at
      any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or
      traditions of men.<sup>9</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward
      illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving
      understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,<sup>10</sup> and
      that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and
      government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are
      to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to
      the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.<sup

      <br />
      11. 1 Corinthians 11:13-14; 1 Corinthians 14:26,40
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.</b> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
      alike clear unto all;<sup>12</sup> yet those things which are necessary to
      be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded
      and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
      but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a
      sufficient understanding of them.<sup>13</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      12. 2 Peter 3:16
      <br />
      13. Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:130
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>8.</b> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of
      the people of God of old),<sup>14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek
      (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the
      nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and
      providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all
      controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them.<sup
        >15</sup
      >
      But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God,
      who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded
      in the fear of God to read,<sup>16</sup> and search them,<sup>17</sup>
      therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every
      nation unto which they come,<sup>18</sup> that the Word of God dwelling
      plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and
      through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.<sup>19</sup>

      19. Colossians 3:16
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9.</b> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
      Scripture itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true
      and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must
      be searched by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>20</sup>

      <b>10.</b> The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are
      to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
      writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
      whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture
      delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is
      finally resolved.<sup>21</sup>

    <p>

    <h2>Chapter 9. Of Free Will</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty and

      necessity of nature determined to do good or evil.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p>1. Matthew 17:12; James 1:14; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will
      and to do that which was good and well-pleasing to God,<sup>2</sup> but
      yet was unstable, so that he might fall from it.<sup>3</sup>

    <p>
      <b>3.</b> Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all
      ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation;<sup>4</sup>
      so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in
      sin,<sup>5</sup> is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to
      prepare himself thereunto.<sup>6</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of
      grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin,<sup>7</sup> and by
      His grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is
      spiritually good;<sup>8</sup> yet so as that by reason of his remaining
      corruptions, he does not perfectly, nor only will, that which is good, but
      does also will that which is evil.<sup>9</sup>

    <h2>Chapter 14. Of Saving Faith</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to
      the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their
      hearts,<sup>1</sup> and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the
      Word;<sup>2</sup> by which also, and by the administration of baptism and
      the Lord&#x27;s supper, prayer, and other means appointed of God, it is
      increased and strengthened.<sup>3</sup>

    <p>
      <b>2.</b> By this faith a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is
      revealed in the Word for the authority of God himself,<sup>4</sup> and
      also apprehends an excellency therein above all other writings and all
      things in the world,<sup>5</sup> as it bears forth the glory of God in his
      attributes, the excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and the
      power and fullness of the Holy Spirit in his workings and operations: and
      so is enabled to cast his soul upon the truth consequently believed;<sup
        >6</sup
      >
      and also acts differently upon that which each particular passage thereof
      contains; yielding obedience to the commands,<sup>7</sup> trembling at the
      threatenings,<sup>8</sup> and embracing the promises of God for this life
      and that which is to come;<sup>9</sup> but the principle acts of saving
      faith have immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, and resting
      upon him alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by
      virtue of the covenant of grace.<sup>10</sup>

      <b>1.</b> Such of the elect that are converted at riper years, having

      godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrancy,<sup>5</sup> praying
      for pardon and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavor, by supplies
      of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all

      <b>4.</b> As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our

      <b>2.</b> These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are
      the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith;<sup>3</sup> and by
      them believers manifest their thankfulness,<sup>4</sup> strengthen their

      necessary an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them and

      hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty,

      and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for the debt of
      our former sins;<sup>14</sup> but when we have done all we can, we have
      done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants; and because they are
      good they proceed from his Spirit,<sup>15</sup> and as they are wrought by
      us they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection, that

      Christ and the perfection of his obedience; it is likewise of use to the
      regenerate to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin; and the
      threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins deserve, and what
      afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the
      curse and unallayed rigour thereof. The promises of it likewise show them
      God&#x27;s approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect
      upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them by the law as a
      covenant of works; so as man&#x27;s doing good and refraining from evil,
      because the law encourages to the one and deters from the other, is no

      <b>7.</b> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in

      crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ
      being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the

      Chapter 31. Of the State of Man after Death, and of the Resurrection of
      the Dead
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see
      corruption;<sup>1</sup> but their souls, which neither die nor sleep,
      having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave
      them.<sup>2</sup> The souls of the righteous being then made perfect in
      holiness, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ, and
      behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption
      of their bodies;<sup>3</sup> and the souls of the wicked are cast into
      hell; where they remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the
      judgment of the great day;<sup>4</sup>
      besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the
      Scripture acknowledgeth none.

      not sleep, but be changed;<sup>5</sup> and all the dead shall be raised up

    <p>
      <b>1.</b> God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
      righteousness, by Jesus Christ;<sup>1</sup> to whom all power and judgment
      is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall
      be judged,<sup>2</sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon the
      earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of
      their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they
      have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup>3</sup>

      elect; and of his justice, in the eternal damnation of the reprobate, who
      are wicked and disobedient;<sup>4</sup> for then shall the righteous go
      into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory with
      everlasting rewards, in the presence of the Lord; but the wicked, who do
      not know God, and do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast
      aside into everlasting torments,<sup>5</sup> and punished with everlasting
      destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
