  </p>

  <h2>Sola Scriptura (Scripture Only)</h2>
  <p>
    We reaffirm the inerrant Scripture to be the sole source of written divine
    revelation, which alone can bind the conscience. The Bible alone teaches all
    that is necessary for our salvation from sin and is the standard by which
    all Christian behavior must be measured.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that any creed, council or individual may bind a Christian’s
    conscience, that the Holy Spirit speaks independently of or contrary to what
    is set forth in the Bible, or that personal spiritual experience can ever be
    a vehicle of revelation.
  </p>
  <h2>Solus Christus (Christ Alone)</h2>
  <p>
    We reaffirm that our salvation is accomplished by the mediatorial work of
    the historical Christ alone. His sinless life and substitutionary atonement
    alone are sufficient for our justification and reconciliation to the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that the gospel is preached if Christ’s substitutionary work is not
    declared and faith in Christ and his work is not solicited.
  </p>
  <h2>Sola Gratia (Grace Alone)</h2>
  <p>
    We reaffirm that in salvation we are rescued from God’s wrath by his grace
    alone. It is the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit that brings us to
    Christ by releasing us from our bondage to sin and raising us from spiritual
    death to spiritual life.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that salvation is in any sense a human work. Human methods,
    techniques or strategies by themselves cannot accomplish this
    transformation. Faith is not produced by our unregenerated human nature.
  </p>
  <h2>Sola Fide (Faith Alone)</h2>
  <p>
    We reaffirm that justification is by grace alone through faith alone because
    of Christ alone. In justification Christ’s righteousness is imputed to us as
    the only possible satisfaction of God’s perfect justice.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that justification rests on any merit to be found in us, or upon the
    grounds of an infusion of Christ’s righteousness in us, or that an
    institution claiming to be a church that denies or condemns sola fide can be
    recognized as a legitimate church.
  </p>
  <h2>Soli Deo Gloria (To God Alone Be Glory)</h2>
  <p>
    We reaffirm that because salvation is of God and has been accomplished by
    God, it is for God’s glory and that we must glorify him always. We must live
    our entire lives before the face of God, under the authority of God and for
    his glory alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that we can properly glorify God if our worship is confused with
    entertainment, if we neglect either Law or Gospel in our preaching, or if
    self-improvement, self-esteem or selffulfillment are allowed to become
    alternatives to the gospel.
