    <h2>Chapter I – Of the Holy Scripture</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and
      providence, do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as
      to leave men inexcusable;<sup>a</sup> yet are they not sufficient to give
      that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto
      salvation;<sup>b</sup> therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and
      in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto
      his Church;<sup>c</sup> and afterwards, for the better preserving and
      propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort
      of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan
      and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing;<sup>d</sup>
      which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary;<sup>e</sup> those
      former ways of God’s revealing his will unto his people being now
      ceased.<sup>f</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Psa 19:1-3; Rom 1:19-20; 1:32 with 2:1; 2:14-15. • b. 1 Cor 1:21;
      2:13-14. • c. Heb 1:1. • d. Prov 22:19-21; Isa 8:19-20; Mat 4:4, 7, 10;

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> Under the name of holy Scripture, or the Word of God written,
      are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are
      these:
    </p>

      James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and
      third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation All of which
      are given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup
        >5</sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and
      life.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Luke 16:29, 31; Eph 2:20; 2 Tim 3:16; Rev 22:18-19.</p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
      inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are
      of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or
      made use of, than other human writings.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Luke 24:27, 44; Rom 3:2; 2 Pet 1:21.</p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
      believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or
      church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and
      therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. 1 Thes 2:13; 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:19, 21; 1 John 5:9.</p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an
      high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;<sup>a</sup> and the
      heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of
      the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is
      to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of
      man’s salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire
      perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence
      itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding, our full persuasion
      and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is
      from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the
      Word in our hearts.<sup>b</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. 1 Tim 3:15. • b. Isa 59:21; John 16:13-14; 1 Cor 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20,
      27.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for
      his own glory, man’s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set
      down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced
      from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by
      new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup>a</sup>
      Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God
      to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are
      revealed in the Word;<sup>b</sup> and that there are some circumstances
      concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to
      human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of
      nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word,
      which are always to be observed.<sup>c</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Gal 1:8-9; 2 Thes 2:2; 2 Tim 3:15-17. • b. John 6:45; 1 Cor 2:9-12. •
      c. 1 Cor 11:13-14; 14:26, 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7.</b> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
      alike clear unto all;<sup>a</sup> yet those things which are necessary to
      be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded
      and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
      but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a
      sufficient understanding of them.<sup>b</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. 2 Pet 3:16. • b. Psa 119:105, 130.</p>
    <p>
      <b>8.</b> The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of
      the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the
      time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
      immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept
      pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;<sup>a</sup> so as in all
      controversies of religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them.<sup
        >b</sup
      >
      But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God
      who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in
      the fear of God, to read and search them,<sup>c</sup> therefore they are
      to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
      come,<sup>d</sup> that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they
      may worship him in an acceptable manner,<sup>e</sup> and, through patience
      and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.<sup>f</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Mat 5:18. • b. Isa 8:20; John 5:39, 46; Acts 15:15. • c. John 5:39. •
      d. 1 Cor 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 27-28. • e. Col 3:16. • f. Rom 15:4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>9.</b> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
      Scripture itself; and therefore, when there is a question about the true
      and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must
      be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Acts 15:15; 2 Pet 1:20-21.</p>
    <p>
      <b>10.</b> The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are
      to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
      writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
      whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit
      speaking in the Scripture.<sup>a</sup>
    </p>
    <p>a. Mat 22:29, 31; Eph 2:20 with Acts 28:25.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon all

      a. 1 Sam 23:11-12; Mat 11:21, 23; Acts 15:18. • b. Rom 9:11, 13, 16, 18.

    <p>
      <b>3.</b> By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some

    <h2>Chapter VII – Of God’s Covenant with Man</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The distance between God and the creature is so great that
      although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator,
      yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and
      reward but by some voluntary condescension on God’s part, which he hath
      been pleased to express by way of covenant.<sup>a</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works,<sup
        >a</sup
      >
      wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity,<sup
        >b</sup

    <p>
      <b>3.</b> Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that
      covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second,<sup>a</sup> commonly
      called the covenant of grace: wherein he freely offered unto sinners life
      and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him that they
      may be saved,<sup>b</sup> and promising to give unto all those that are
      ordained unto life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to
      believe.<sup>c</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>4.</b> This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in the Scripture
      by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the
      testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to
      it, therein bequeathed.<sup>a</sup>

    <p>a. Luke 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25; Heb 7:22; 9:15-17.</p>
    <p>
      <b>5.</b> This covenant was differently administered in the time of the
      law and in the time of the gospel:<sup>a</sup> under the law it was
      administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the
      paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of
      the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come,<sup>b</sup> which were for
      that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit,
      to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,<sup
        >c</sup
      >
      by whom they had full remission of sins and eternal salvation; and is

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>6.</b> Under the gospel, when Christ the substance<sup>a</sup> was
      exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the
      preaching of the Word and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism
      and the Lord’s Supper;<sup>b</sup> which, though fewer in number, and
      administered with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet in them it
      is held forth in more fulness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy,<sup
        >c</sup
      >
      to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles;<sup>d</sup> and is called the New
      Testament.<sup>e</sup> There are not, therefore, two covenants of grace

      the favour of God and estate of salvation,<sup>a</sup> which hope of

      Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good

    <p>
      <b>2.</b> This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable
      persuasion, grounded upon a fallible hope;<sup>a</sup> but an infallible
      assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the promises of
      salvation,<sup>b</sup> the inward evidence of those graces unto which
      these promises are made,<sup>c</sup> the testimony of the Spirit of
      adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God:<sup

      by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he
      may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means,
      attain thereunto.<sup>b</sup> And therefore it is the duty of everyone to
      give all diligence to make his calling and election sure;<sup>c</sup> that
      thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in
      love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the

    <h2>Chapter XX – Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the
      gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning
      wrath of God, the curse of the moral law;<sup>a</sup> and in their being
      delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of
      sin,<sup>b</sup> from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the
      victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation;<sup>c</sup> as also in
      their free access to God,<sup>d</sup> and their yielding obedience unto
      him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.<sup
        >e</sup
      >
      All which were common also to believers under the law;<sup>f</sup> but
      under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further enlarged in
      their freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish
      Church was subjected;<sup>g</sup> and in greater boldness of access to the
      throne of grace,<sup>h</sup> and in fuller communications of the free
      Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.<sup

      <b>2.</b> God alone is Lord of the conscience,<sup>a</sup> and hath left
      it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in anything
      contrary to his Word, or beside it, in matters of faith or worship.<sup

      So that to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands out of

      <b>1.</b> The light of nature showeth that there is a God, who hath
      lordship and sovereignty over all; is good, and doeth good unto all; and
      is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and
      served with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the
      might.<sup>a</sup> But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is
      instituted by himself, and so limited to his own revealed will, that he
      may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or
      the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations or any other
      way not prescribed in the Holy Scripture.<sup>b</sup>

    <h2>Chapter XXII – Of Lawful Oaths and Vows</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> A lawful oath is a part of religious worship,<sup>a</sup>
      wherein, upon just occasion, the person swearing solemnly calleth God to
      witness what he asserteth or promiseth; and to judge him according to the
      truth or falsehood of what he sweareth.<sup>b</sup>

    <p>
      a. Deut 10:20. • b. Exod 20:7; Lev 19:12; 2 Chron 6:22-23; 2 Cor 1:23.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and
      therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence;<sup>a</sup>
      therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or
      to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred.<sup
        >b</sup
      >
      Yet as, in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the Word
      of God, under the New Testament, as well as under the Old,<sup>c</sup> so
      a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters ought to
      be taken.<sup>d</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> Whosoever taketh an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness
      of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully
      persuaded is the truth.<sup>a</sup> Neither may any man bind himself by
      oath to anything but what is good and just, and what he believeth so to
      be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.<sup>b</sup> Yet it is a
      sin to refuse an oath touching anything that is good and just, being
      imposed by lawful authority.<sup>c</sup>

    <p>
      <b>4.</b> An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the
      words, without equivocation or mental reservation.<sup>a</sup> It cannot
      oblige to sin; but in anything not sinful, being taken, it binds to
      performance, although to a man’s own hurt:<sup>b</sup> nor is it to be

    <p>
      <b>6.</b> It is not to be made to any creature, but to God alone:<sup
        >a</sup
      >
      and that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of faith
      and conscience of duty, in way of thankfulness for mercy received, or for
      the obtaining of what we want; whereby we more strictly bind ourselves to
      necessary duties, or to other things, so far and so long as they may fitly
      conduce thereunto.<sup>b</sup>

    <p>
      <b>7.</b> No man may vow to do anything forbidden in the Word of God, or
      what would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in his own
      power, and for the performance whereof he hath no promise or ability from
      God.<sup>a</sup> In which respect, Popish monastical vows of perpetual
      single life, professed poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from

      <b>3.</b> The civil magistrate may not assume to himself the

      a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that doth administer

      and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of

    <p>a. Mat 3:11; 28:19-20; John 1:33.</p>

      <b>5.</b> Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this
      ordinance,<sup>a</sup> yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably
      annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without

      the sacrament of his body and blood, called the Lord’s Supper, to be
      observed in his Church, unto the end of the world; for the perpetual

      dead,<sup>a</sup> but only a commemoration of that one offering up of
      himself, by himself, upon the cross, once for all, and a spiritual
      oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same;<sup>b</sup> so that
      the Popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominably

      transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is
      repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense and reason;

      upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood
      of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the

      Chapter XXXII – Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection
      of the Dead
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see
      corruption;<sup>a</sup> but their souls (which neither die nor sleep),
      having an immortal subsistence,<sup>b</sup> immediately return to God who
      gave them. The souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in
      holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the
      face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their
      bodies:<sup>c</sup> and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where
      they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of
      the great day.<sup>d</sup>
      Besides these two places for souls separated from their bodies, the
      Scripture acknowledgeth none.

      Acts 1:25; 1 Pet 3:19; Jude 1:6-7.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be
      changed;<sup>a</sup> and all the dead shall be raised up with the
      self-same bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which
      shall be united again to their souls forever.<sup>b</sup>

      <b>3.</b> The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be
      raised to dishonor; the bodies of the just, by his Spirit, unto honor, and
      be made conformable to his own glorious body.<sup>a</sup>

    <h2>Chapter XXXIII – Of the Last Judgment</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1.</b> God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in
      righteousness by Jesus Christ,<sup>a</sup> to whom all power and judgment
      is given of the Father.<sup>b</sup> In which day, not only the apostate
      angels shall be judged,<sup>c</sup> but likewise all persons, that have
      lived upon earth, shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an
      account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to
      what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup>d</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2.</b> The end of God’s appointing this day, is for the manifestation
      of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the elect;<sup
        >a</sup
      >
      and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and
      disobedient.<sup>b</sup> For then shall the righteous go into everlasting
      life, and receive that fulness of joy and refreshing which shall come from
      the presence of the Lord:<sup>c</sup> but the wicked, who know not God,
      and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal
      torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence
      of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.<sup>d</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.</b> As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there
      shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the
      greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:<sup>a</sup> so will
      he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal
      security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the
      Lord will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come
      quickly. Amen.<sup>b</sup>
