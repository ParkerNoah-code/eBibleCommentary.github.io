        <h1>Calling and Responsibility</h1>
        <h2>James 3:1</h2>
        <p>
          "Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will
          receive heavier judgment."
        </p>

        <h2>1 Timothy 4:12-16</h2>
        <p>
          "Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who
          believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith,
          and in purity. Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation,
          and to teaching. Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was
          given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the
          elders. Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them,
          that your progress may be revealed to all. Pay attention to yourself
          and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you
          will save both yourself and those who hear you."
        </p>

        <h2>Titus 2:1-8</h2>
        <p>
          "But say the things which fit sound doctrine, that older men should be
          temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in
          perseverance, and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior,
          not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is
          good, that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to
          love their children, to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home,
          kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may
          not be blasphemed. Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober
          minded. In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your
          teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, and soundness
          of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be
          ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us."
        </p>

        <h1>Teaching Faithfully</h1>
        <h2>2 Timothy 2:1-2</h2>
        <p>
          "You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in
          Christ Jesus. The things which you have heard from me among many
          witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to
          teach others also."
        </p>

        <h2>Deuteronomy 6:4-9</h2>
        <p>
          "Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is one. You shall love Yahweh
          your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
          might. These words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart;
          and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk
          of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and
          when you lie down, and when you rise up. You shall bind them for a
          sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
          You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your
          gates."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 78:4-8</h2>
        <p>
          "We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation
          to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous deeds
          that he has done. For he established a covenant in Jacob, and
          appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that
          they should make them known to their children; that the generation to
          come might know, even the children who should be born; who should
          arise and tell their children, that they might set their hope in God,
          and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments, and might not
          be as their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a
          generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not
          steadfast with God."
        </p>

        <h1>The Message</h1>
        <h2>Matthew 28:19-20</h2>
        <p>
          "'Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of
          the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to
          observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always,
          even to the end of the age.' Amen."
        </p>

        <h2>Luke 24:46-47</h2>
        <p>
          "He said to them, 'Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for
          the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that
          repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all
          the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Acts 10:42-43</h2>
        <p>
          "He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is
          he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.
          All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who
          believes in him will receive remission of sins."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 4:17</h2>
        <p>
          "From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, 'Repent! For the
          Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.'"
        </p>

        <h1>The Source</h1>
        <h2>2 Timothy 3:16</h2>
        <p>
          "Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for
          reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that
          each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
          for every good work."
        </p>

        <h2>John 17:17</h2>
        <p>"Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth."</p>

        <h2>Psalm 119:105</h2>
        <p>"Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path."</p>

        <h1>Teaching Accurately</h1>
        <h2>2 Timothy 2:14-19</h2>
        <p>
          "Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord
          that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of
          those who hear. Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a
          workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of
          Truth. But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
          and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and
          Philetus: men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the
          resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
          However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: 'The Lord
          knows those who are his,' and, 'Let every one who names the name of
          the Lord depart from unrighteousness.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Joshua 1:8</h2>
        <p>
          "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall
          meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to
          all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way
          prosperous, and then you shall have good success."
        </p>

        <h2>John 8:31-32</h2>
        <p>
          "Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, 'If you
          remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. You will know the
          truth, and the truth will make you free.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Acts 17:11</h2>
        <p>
          "Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
          received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures
          daily to see whether these things were so."
        </p>

        <h1>Spiritual Gifting</h1>
        <h2>Romans 12:4-8</h2>
        <p>
          "For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members
          don’t have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in
          Christ, and individually members of one another, having gifts
          differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy,
          let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; or service,
          let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;
          or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with
          generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
          cheerfulness."
        </p>

        <h2>1 Corinthians 12:28</h2>
        <p>
          "God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets,
          third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps,
          governments, and various kinds of languages."
        </p>

        <h2>Ephesians 4:11-16</h2>
        <p>
          "He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
          evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers; for the perfecting of
          the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of
          Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the
          knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of
          the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may no longer be
          children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of
          doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of
          error; but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into
          him who is the head, Christ, from whom all the body, being fitted and
          knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to
          the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body
          increase to the building up of itself in love."
        </p>

        <h2>1 Peter 4:10-11</h2>
        <p>
          "As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as
          good managers of the grace of God in its various forms. If anyone
          speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves,
          let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things
          God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory
          and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
        </p>

        <h1>False Teaching</h1>
        <h2>2 Timothy 4:1-5</h2>
        <p>
          "I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
          will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
          preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove,
          rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. For the time will
          come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having
          itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own
          lusts, and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to
          fables. But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work
          of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry."
        </p>

        <h2>Galatians 1:6-9</h2>
        <p>
          "I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the
          grace of Christ to a different 'good news', but there isn’t another
          'good news.' Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert
          the Good News of Christ. But even though we, or an angel from heaven,
          should preach to you any 'good news' other than that which we preached
          to you, let him be cursed. As we have said before, so I now say again:
          if any man preaches to you any 'good news' other than that which you
          received, let him be cursed."
        </p>

        <h2>2 Peter 2:1</h2>
        <p>
          "But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers
          will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive
          heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on
          themselves swift destruction."
        </p>

        <h1>Example and Admonition</h1>
        <h2>Colossians 3:16</h2>
        <p>
          "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching
          and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,
          singing with grace in your heart to the Lord."
        </p>

        <h2>Hebrews 13:7</h2>
        <p>
          "Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and
          considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith."
        </p>

        <h2>Philippians 4:9</h2>
        <p>
          "Do the things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me, and
          the God of peace will be with you."
        </p>

        <h2>Proverbs 22:6</h2>
        <p>
          "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will
          not depart from it."
        </p>

        <h1>Teaching Attitude</h1>
        <h2>2 Timothy 2:24-26</h2>
        <p>
          "The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able
          to teach, patient, in gentleness correcting those who oppose him.
          Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of
          the truth, and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare,
          having been taken captive by him to do his will."
        </p>

        <h2>Titus 2:7-8</h2>
        <p>
          "In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your
          teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, and soundness
          of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be
          ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us."
