          Baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances of positive and sovereign
          institution, appointed by the Lord Jesus, the only lawgiver, to be
          continued in his church to the end of the world. These holy
          appointments are to be administered by those only who are qualified
          and thereunto called, according to the commission of Christ.

          Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus
          Christ, to be unto the party baptized, a sign of his fellowship with
          him, in his death and resurrection; of his being engrafted into him;
          of remission of sins; and of giving up into God, through Jesus Christ,
          to live and walk in newness of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who do actually profess repentance towards God, faith in, and
          obedience to, our Lord Jesus Christ, are the only proper subjects of
          this ordinance. The outward element to be used in this ordinance is
          water, wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father,
          and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Immersion, or dipping of the
          person in water, is necessary to the due administration of this
          ordinance.

          The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night
          wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end
          of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the
          world the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith
          of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment,
          and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties
          which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion
          with him, and with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this
          ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not
          carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ
          crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of
          Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present
          to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements
          themselves are to their outward senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion
          with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table, and cannot,
          without great sin against him, while they remain such, partake of
          these holy mysteries, or be admitted thereunto; yea, whosoever shall
          receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,
          eating and drinking judgment to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers to
          pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set
          them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the
          bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to
          give both to the communicants. The outward elements in this ordinance,
          duly set apart to the use ordained by Christ, have such relation to
          him crucified, as that truly, although in terms used figuratively,
          they are sometimes called by the names of the things they represent,
          in other words, the body and blood of Christ, albeit, in substance and
          nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real
          sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but
          only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself upon the
          cross, once for all; and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise
          unto God for the same. So that the popish sacrifice of the mass, as
          they call it, is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own sacrifice
          the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.
        </p>
        <p>
          That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and
          wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood, commonly called
          transubstantiation, by consecration of a priest, or by any other way,
          is repugnant not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense and
          reason, overthrows the nature of the ordinance, and has been, and is,
          the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross idolatries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the
          lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving
          them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature
          of this ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.
