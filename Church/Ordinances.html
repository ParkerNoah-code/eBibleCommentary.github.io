          Baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances of positive and sovereign
          institution, appointed by the Lord Jesus, the only lawgiver, to be
          continued in his church to the end of the world. These holy
          appointments are to be administered by those only who are qualified
          and thereunto called, according to the commission of Christ.

        <p>
          <a href="Ordinances/Baptism.html">Baptism</a>: Baptism is an ordinance
          of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to be unto the party
          baptized, a sign of his fellowship with him, in his death and
          resurrection; of his being engrafted into him; of remission of sins;
          and of giving up into God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in
          newness of life. The outward element to be used in this ordinance is
          water, wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father,
          and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Immersion, or dipping of the
          person in water, is necessary to the due administration of this
          ordinance.

        <p>
          <a href="Ordinances/LordsSupper.html">The Lord's Supper</a>: The
          supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein
          he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the
          world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the
          sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of
          believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment,
          and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties
          which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion
          with him, and with each other.
