        <p><b>1. Its practice is unsupported by the word of God.</b></p>
        <p>
          Proposition stated; no authority in the Bible for infant baptism;
          confessions or its advocates; the great Protestant rule in religion;
          their arguments; it is no baptism; forms of the evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          PERFECTION on earth, in its absolute form, unhappily no longer exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Man's first disobedience&quot; brought sin into the world. Evil
          was its attendant. And since that fatal hour, evil has been connected
          with all that pertains to our race! It is like the air we breathe, an
          ever present influence. It corrupts all that is pure, and impairs all
          that is beautiful. Where are the natural beings whose perfection's it
          has not disturbed? What rule of moral action is there, from compliance
          with which it has not turned men aside? But these are not its most
          lamentable developments. Evil is found prevailing even in the
          professed churches of Christ! Nor is its presence in the sanctuary
          seldom apparent. Scarcely is there a feature in our holy religion,
          which it has not somewhere, marred or distorted! In no form, however,
          has it afflicted the cause of truth and salvation more grievously,
          than in that of infant baptism; a rite generally prevalent, but
          without divine authority; repulsive in itself, and in its consequences
          always injurious. This declaration I hold myself bound, in the
          following pages, to sustain by adequate testimony. At present I
          solicit your attention to the proposition announced: &quot;Infant
          baptism is an evil because it is unsupported by the word of God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is assumed that infant baptism is unsupported by the word of God.
          This is the subject of the proposition. If, upon examination, it be
          found true, the predicate, that it is an evil, follows as a matter of
          course. The forms and bearing of that evil may then be considered. Is
          infant baptism supported by the word of God? I aver that it is not. It
          is nowhere commanded. It is nowhere, in any form, divinely authorized.
          Examine the holy record, from first to last, and you will discover not
          a trace of infant baptism. If it is anywhere commanded, or authorized,
          the passages in which that fact appears, can be produced. Where are
          they? Let them be forthcoming. We have a right to see, and to examine
          them, for ourselves. We demand the texts. But this demand has before
          been often made, and always in vain. They have never been produced.
          They have not yet been found. They never can be found. They do not
          exist. The word of God, in all its length and breadth, contains not a
          syllable of authority for infant baptism, in the form of command, of
          precept, of permission, of example, or in any other form whatever. In
          that sacred book not one word in relation to it, is anywhere uttered.
          He who claims divine authority for infant baptism, must justify
          himself by adducing it. Until he does so, the least that can be said
          of it, is that &quot;it is unsupported by the word of God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The authority demanded, has however often been essayed. Learned,
          ingenious, and protracted efforts have been attempted by every sect
          into which Pedobaptist Christendom is divided. But as if God had
          determined to defend his own truth by the individual conflicts of its
          adversaries, it has turned out that no two of them have been able to
          harmonize either as to what may be regarded as testimony in the
          premises, or the class of infants divinely authorized to be baptized!
          Each is in collision with every other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wall, Hammond, and others of that school, claim that Jewish proselyte
          baptism is its broad and ample foundation. Owen, Jennings, and many
          more, repudiate Jewish proselyte baptism, and predicate it upon
          circumcision as taught in the Abrahamic covenant. Beza, Doddridge, and
          their associates, teach that children are holy, and are therefore to
          be baptized. Wesley, and his disciples, teach that they are unholy,
          and must be baptized to cleanse them from their defilements. Burder,
          Dwight, and their class, permit no other infants to be baptized but
          those of Christian parents, all of whom they contend, are born in the
          church, and are therefore entitled to its ordinances. Baxter, Henry,
          and those of similar faith, baptize infants to bring them into the
          covenant and church of the Redeemer. The evangelical divines of the
          Church of England, and of the Episcopal Church of America, tell us
          that the doctrine of infant baptism is deduced by analogical
          reasoning, from statements of scripture applying more expressly, to
          the case of adult baptism.&quot; But those of the opposite character
          teach that baptism gives to the infant the regeneration of the Holy
          Ghost, and must therefore be administered. Many others receive and
          practice it, because, as they say, &quot;It is in consonance with the
          general spirit of religion!&quot; Each of these theories shows all the
          others to be wholly destitute of scriptural support. Among the several
          classes of religionists now indicated, are to be found very many men
          of the most extensive learning and research. Why are they all thus in
          hopeless conflict on the subject? The moment one brings forward his
          scriptural proofs of infant baptism, all the others clearly show them
          to be utterly false. Could this be the case were the ordinance
          anywhere enjoined or authorized? Every unprejudiced mind must see
          that, taken together, the arguments of all classes of Pedobaptists,
          destroy one another throughout. Like the builders at Babel, no two of
          them speak the same tongue, although every one protests that he utters
          the language of the Bible! It is true consequently, for any thing that
          yet appears to the contrary, that infant baptism is unsupported by the
          word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have testimony in proof of our proposition still stronger if
          possible, than any which has yet been submitted. Very many of the most
          learned and pious Pedobaptist Biblical critics, themselves candidly
          confess that infant baptism is not distinctly enjoined, nor directly
          taught, in the word of God. Some of these I will now proceed to
          specify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martin Luther, the great father of the Reformation, says:?&quot;It
          cannot be proved by the scriptures, that infant baptism was instituted
          by Christ, or begun by the first Christians after the
          apostles.&quot;<sup>1</sup> John Calvin testifies thus:?&quot;It is
          nowhere expressly mentioned by the evangelists, that any child was by
          the apostles baptized.&quot;<sup>2</sup> Bishop Burner avers:
          &quot;There is no express precept, or rule given in the New Testament
          for the baptism of infants.<sup>3</sup> &quot;Strarck says:?&quot;The
          connection of infant baptism with circumcision deserves no
          consideration, since there were physical reasons for circumcising in
          infancy.&quot;<sup>4</sup> Angusti says:?&quot;The parallel between
          circumcision and baptism is altogether foreign to the New
          Testament.&quot;<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Jeremy Taylor thus writes:?&quot;For the argument from
          circumcision, it is invalid from infinite considerations. Figures and
          types prove nothing, unless a command go along with them, or some
          express to signify such to be their purpose.&quot;6 Dr. Woods of
          Andover remarks:?&quot;It is a plain case that there is no express
          precept respecting infant baptism in our sacred writings. The proof
          then, that it is a divine institution must be made out in some other
          way.&quot;7 Prof. Stuart says:?&quot;Commands, or plain and certain
          examples in the New Testament, relative to it [infant baptism] I do
          not find.&quot;8 And finally Dr. Neander declares:?&quot;As baptism
          was closely united with a conscious entrance on Christian communion,
          faith and baptism were always connected with one another; and thus it
          is in the highest degree probable, that baptism was performed only in
          instances where both could meet together, and that the practice of
          infant baptism was unknown&quot; to the apostolic age.9 In another
          work Neander says:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Baptism was at first, administered only to adults, as men were
          accustomed to conceive baptism and faith as strictly connected. We
          have all reason for not deriving infant baptism from apostolic
          institution.&quot;10
        </p>
        <p>
          Multitudes of other similar declarations could, were they necessary,
          be readily produced, but these are amply sufficient. It is
          acknowledged that the word of God does not teach infant baptism. This
          acknowledgment is made candidly, by those who ought to know, since
          they were among the most learned men, and best Biblical critics the
          world has ever produced, made against themselves, voluntarily, freely,
          and of their own accord, and ought therefore to be considered decisive
          of the question. Infant baptism is not found in any form in the Bible.
          Every effort to deduce it from the sacred records, no matter how
          ingeniously conducted, has proved a wretched failure. It is confessed
          by its advocates that it is not found in the inspired pages. Infant
          baptism is therefore, unsupported by the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          May I now, in view of all these facts, and considerations, solicit
          your attention to the great Protestant principle in religion, so
          familiarly known to all who are in the least conversant with sacred
          literature??&quot;The word of God is a perfect rule of faith and
          practice.&quot; To this maxim every evangelical denomination professes
          to bow with entire submission. It avows the scriptures to be not the
          supreme authority only, but also the sole authority, in all that
          pertains to religion. It repudiates all tradition. It looks not to the
          Fathers of the church of whatever period, except in so far as they are
          sustained by the divine word. It relies exclusively upon the
          scriptures. If any doctrine or practice be there clearly taught, it
          must be received heartily, and fully. If otherwise, you dare not admit
          it. &quot;The word of God is a perfect rule of faith and
          practice.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          For myself, and for my brethren?although we are not Protestants?I
          declare for this Christian law in religion the sincerest reverence. We
          receive it fully, and conform to it in every respect. We do this
          however, not simply because it is wise in principle, and safe in
          practice, but because it is really an embodiment in another form, of
          the law of God himself. It comes to us with the sanction not of men
          only, but of God. The language of Jehovah on the subject is this:
        </p>
        <p>
          What thing soever I command you, observe to do it. Thou shalt not add
          thereto, nor diminish from it.&quot; (Deuteronomy 12:3.)
        </p>
        <p>And in another place he says:</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
          shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of
          the Lord your God which I command you.&quot; (Deuteronomy 4:2.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this a plain declaration, in other terms, that, &quot;The word
          of God is a perfect rule of faith and practice?&quot; Does any one
          suppose that since these precepts had a more direct reference to the
          law of Moses, that they are not equally applicable under the gospel?
          To such it may be replied, that the law was much less perfect than is
          the gospel. Did our Heavenly Father enforce the obligations of the
          former with the most jealous particularity, and is he less careful as
          to our compliance with the demands of the latter? Such an objection is
          unreasonable. It is. also in direct conflict with apostolic teaching.
          To this very topic Paul refers, when he says:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;God, who at sundry times, and in diverse manners, spake in times
          past to the fathers, by the prophets hath in these last days spoken
          unto us, by his Son.&quot; (Hebrews 1:1)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
          which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if
          the word spoken by angels [messengers, in the law] was steadfast, and
          every transgression, and disobedience received a just recompense of
          reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at
          the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by
          them that heard him, God also bearing them witness, both with signs
          and wonders, and diverse miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost?&quot;
          (Hebrews 2:1-4.)
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
          not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape
          if we refuse him that speaketh from heaven.&quot; (Hebrews 12:25.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is seen that if the inspired apostle knew where of he
          affirmed, and reasoned not illogically, it is unquestionably true that
          the gospel requires to be obeyed, not with less, but with more
          carefulness, particularity, and fidelity than did the law. To no
          commandment of the gospel therefore, may you add any thing whatever;
          neither may you diminish aught from it. You are obliged to obey, and
          in the manner en joined, all that Jehovah has there revealed for your
          guidance. It is &quot;the word of God,&quot; and that &quot;is a
          perfect rule of faith and practice.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we are constantly told that the gospel, unlike the law, is in many
          respects, indefinite in its instructions, giving only the outlines,
          and great principles of religion, and leaving the details to be filled
          up by the wisdom and pious discretion of the followers of Christ. He
          who has arrived at this conclusion has wholly mistaken the subject. If
          the word of God is a perfect rule of faith and practice, then the
          assumption cannot possibly be true. It is unreasonable in itself; it
          is in conflict with the inspired teachings just recited; and it
          proceeds on the false assumption that the gospel is less perfect than
          the law! On the contrary, in the gospel every duty required is
          distinctly enjoined. No one need mistake its authority, or its nature.
          That rule is certainly not perfect, to whatever department of life it
          may pertain, which only sketches general principles, and great
          outlines, and leaves the details to be supplied by each individual in
          such manner as may seem to him most proper. The word of God is no such
          rule. It is perfect. It is disfigured by neither redundancy nor
          defect. It must be obeyed in all things, without addition, diminution
          or change. You can never depart from it in any particular, without
          incurring imminent peril.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is proper to remark in passing, that our Pedobapist brethren have
          yet another method of satisfying themselves that infant baptism is
          scriptural. When, as we have seen, Dr. Woods stated that since,
          &quot;It is a plain case that there is no express precept concerning
          infant baptism in our sacred writings,&quot; and that consequently,
          &quot;The proof that it is a divine institution must be made out in
          some other way,&quot; you were perhaps, at a loss to conceive what
          that &quot;other way&quot; could be. By what process can any ordinance
          be proved &quot;a divine institution,&quot; in regard to which not a
          word is said &quot;in our sacred writings?&quot; No such thing can be
          done. Since the Bible is our only authority in all cases, the proof
          proposed is clearly impossible. We will, however, hear Dr. Woods. He
          obtains his proof thus:?&quot;It cannot with any good reason, be
          denied, or doubted, that those Christian writers who have, in
          different ways, given testimony to the prevalence of infant baptism in
          the early ages of Christianity, are credible witnesses. Nor can it be
          denied that they were under the best advantages to know whether the
          practice commenced in the times of the apostles. On this subject, as
          they were not liable to mistake, so their testimony is entitled to
          full credit!&quot;11 This is the method. It is by tradition, vouched
          by the Fathers, that Protestant Pedobaptists discover that the word of
          God teaches ordinances which are confessedly not in the word of God!
          These Protestants will not allow the papists to prove, in the same
          way, the divine authority for the invocation of saints, prayers for
          the dead, the use of holy water, and such like institutions,&quot;
          which they can do, readily and fully. They are Popish. But this is
          Protestant. If, therefore, the Fathers say, this was an apostolic
          tradition, it was an apostolic tradition! And more; in this matter,
          these same Fathers were not liable to mistake!&quot; Their authority
          therefore, though entirely worthless when in favor of the Catholics,
          is when infant baptism is to be proved scriptural, as good at least,
          as that of the apostles, since of them no more can be said than that
          they were not liable to mistake! Who would have supposed that
          theological professors could have been guilty of reasoning so
          absurdly? The argument, it would seem, needs not a word of refutation.
          I would not stop to consider it, if Dr. Woods alone, relied upon such
          testimonies. But it is a common Pedobaptist resort. I will offer two
          or three examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Miller deposes thus regarding tradition:?&quot;The history of the
          Christian church from the apostolic age, furnishes an argument of
          irresistible force, in favor of the divine authority of infant
          baptism.&quot; He proceeds:?&quot;Can the most incredulous reader who
          is not fast bound in the fetters of invincible prejudice, hesitate to
          admit, first, that Augustine, and Pelagius, verily believed that
          infant baptism had been the universal practice of the church from the
          days of the apostles; and secondly, that situated, and informed as
          they were, it was impossible that they should be mistaken?&quot;12
          These men flourished four hundred years after Christ. The word of God
          says not a word about infant baptism. This however does not disconcert
          Dr. Miller. Augustine, and Pelagius, say it was an apostolic
          tradition. And this he says, is &quot;an argument of irresistible
          force, in favor of the divine authority of infant baptism,&quot; and
          by which every one &quot;not fast bound in the fetters of invincible
          prejudice,&quot; must be convinced. But these Fathers also declared
          that infant communion was an apostolic tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Dr. Miller does not regard as of any importance. Their testimony
          makes infant baptism scriptural; but it has no such effect upon infant
          communion! Was Dr. Miller dreaming when he uttered this logic? Richard
          Watson says:?&quot;The antiquity of infant baptism,&quot; taken
          together with the other arguments, establish this practice of the
          church upon the strongest basis of scripture authority!&quot; In
          another place he says:?&quot;That a practice which can be traced up to
          the very first periods of the church, and has been till very modern
          times, its uncontradicted practice, should have a lower authority than
          apostolic usage, may be pronounced impossible.&quot;13 To these I will
          add the declaration of Mr. Hodges. He says:?&quot;Were there no other
          testimony but that of Irenaeus alone, it seems to me, every unbiased
          and conscientious man must hold himself bound to continue infant
          baptism, were the scriptures even silent on the subject.&quot;14 By
          these and such like arguments, our Pedobaptist brethren essay to prove
          infant baptism scriptural, not by the scriptures, but by the Fathers.
          &quot;It is a plain case,&quot; say they, &quot;that there is no
          express precept respecting infant baptism in our sacred
          writings;&quot; yet we are assured that the traditions of early times,
          vouched by the Fathers, &quot;establish the divine authority of infant
          baptism with irresistible force.&quot; The Fathers say it was
          practiced in the time of the apostles, and &quot;it was impossible
          that they should be mistaken!&quot; It is not in the scriptures, but
          it is undeniably scriptural! And these men who so contradict
          themselves, and abuse common sense, are Protestant?s, who proclaim
          that &quot;The word of God is a perfect rule of faith and
          practice,&quot; and who clamorously join in the cry, &quot;The Bible,
          the Bible alone, is the religion of Protestants.&quot; Yet totally
          aside from the Bible, and by tradition exclusively, they hold infant
          baptism. Thus they renounce, in this case at least, their professed
          Protestant principles, and return to the old and exploded dogmatism of
          Popery. Their position is utterly inconsistent, and cannot be
          maintained. They are in truth, compelled either to reject all the
          traditions, as they do all the teachings of the Fathers, which are not
          sustained by the word of God, and thus become Baptists; or, as in this
          instance, they must receive them all irrespective of their biblical
          character, and thus become avowed Roman Catholics. However this may
          be, by the confession that the Bible does not in itself teach it, they
          have surrendered the argument to us, and made the truth still more
          sure, that Infant baptism is unsupported by the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          How unlike the reasoning of Woods, and Miller, Watson, and the rest,
          on patristic tradition, is that of their brother pedobaptist, the
          great Neander! He says: &quot;Not till so late a period as?at least
          certainly not earlier than?Irenaeus appears a trace of infant baptism.
          That it first became recognized as an apostolic tradition in the
          course of the third century is evidence rather against, than for the
          admission of its apostolic origin, especially since, in the spirit of
          the age when Christianity appeared, there were many elements which
          must have been favorable to the introduction of infant baptism.&quot;
          These were &quot;the same elements from which [afterwards] proceeded
          the notion of the magical effects of outward baptism; the notion of
          its absolute necessity for salvation; the notion which gave rise to
          the mythos that the apostles baptized the Old Testament saints in
          Hades.
        </p>
        <p>
          How very much must infant baptism have corresponded with such a
          tendency, if it had been favored by tradition! It might indeed, be
          alleged on the other hand, that after infant baptism had long been
          recognized as an apostolical tradition, many other causes hindered its
          universal introduction, and the same causes might still earlier stand
          in the way of its spread, although a practice sanctioned by the
          apostles. But these causes could not have acted in this manner in the
          apostolic age. In later times we see the opposition between theory and
          practice, in this respect, actually coming forth. Besides, it is a
          different thing that a practice which could not altogether deny the
          marks of its later institution, although at last recognized as of
          apostolic founding, could not for a length of time, pervade the life
          of the church; and that a practice really proceeding from apostolic
          institution, and tradition, notwithstanding the authority that
          introduced it, and the circumstances in its favor arising from the
          spirit of the times, should not yet [in the third century] have been
          generally adopted. And if we wish to ascertain from whom such an
          institution was originated, we should say certainly, not immediately
          from Christ himself. Was it from the primitive church in Palestine,
          from an injunction given by the earlier apostles? But among the Jewish
          Christians circumcision was held as a seal of the covenant, and hence
          they had so much less occasion to make use of another dedication for
          their children. Could it have been Paul who first among heathen
          Christians introduced this alteration in the use of baptism?
        </p>
        <p>
          But this would agree least of all with the peculiar Christian
          characteristics of this apostle. He who says of himself that Christ
          sent him not to baptize, but to preach the gospel; he who always kept
          his eye fixed on one thing, justification by faith, and so carefully
          avoided every thing which could give a handle or support to the notion
          of a justification by outward things; how could he have set up infant
          baptism against the circumcision that continued to be practiced by the
          Jewish Christians? In this case the dispute carried on with the
          Judaizing party, on the necessity of circumcision, would easily have
          given an opportunity of introducing this substitute into the
          controversy, if it had really existed. The evidence arising from
          silence on this topic has therefore the greater weight.&quot;15 Thus
          this distinguished scholar, and Ecclesiastical Historian, disposes of
          the question about which others are so confident, whether infant
          baptism was really an apostolical tradition. He fully proves the whole
          to be an utter fiction, not less gross than that which insisted that
          &quot;the apostles baptized the Old Testament saints in Hades.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There is still one other argument however, which is supposed by many,
          to be sufficient to sustain infant baptism upon a scriptural basis, as
          a &quot;divine institution.&quot; I am told It is not forbidden in the
          word of God. It may therefore be practiced. Not forbidden, forsooth!
          Infant baptism not forbidden in the word of God! It may therefore, be
          practiced! And is this the fashion of your argument? Upon this
          principle what may you not do? You are obliged to baptize all to whom
          God has commanded the ordinance to be administered; and you may also
          baptize all others whose baptism he has not expressly forbidden! What
          shall I say of a proposition so monstrous? Its folly can be concealed
          from no one, who will think for a single moment on the subject. Need I
          enter into its formal refutation? This is surely unnecessary. Yet,
          since the argument is so easy and plain, it may be as well to prove
          that infant baptism is in truth, actually prohibited by the word of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is prohibited, in the first place, by the fact that it is
          unrecognized in the sacred records, as a divine institution. The great
          Christian axiom which teaches that &quot;The word of God is a perfect
          rule of faith and practice,&quot; is, as we have seen, adopted by
          every Protestant denomination upon the face of the earth. We have,
          besides this, seen that it is fully sustained by the teachings of
          divine revelation, and that no other principle in religion, can be
          true in theory, or safe in practice. Whatever God has revealed, we are
          bound to receive in the love of it, and to obey with reverence, and
          fidelity, without addition, diminution, or change. Infant baptism, we
          have clearly seen, is not taught in the Bible. Its friends and
          advocates confess that it does not there appear, and therefore they
          vainly seek to sustain it by tradition, and the authority of early
          Christian Fathers. Is all this true? Is the word of God not a perfect
          rule of faith and practice? Are you, as taught by Moses and Paul,
          permitted to add any thing to the commandments of God, or to diminish
          aught from them? Dare you receive any doctrine as an article of faith.
          Or practice any rite as a Christian ordinance, not taught, and
          instituted by Jehovah? To these inquires who will venture an
          affirmative answer? No one, surely. Is infant baptism directly
          enjoined in the word of God? It confessedly is not. Then it is not by
          the word of God allowed. It is unlawful. And that which cannot be
          allowed, because it is not lawful, is clearly prohibited. Thus God
          has, in his word, clearly prohibited infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infant baptism is prohibited, secondly, by the apostolic commission.
          This is the &quot;law of baptism&quot; instituted by Jesus Christ
          himself, and the &quot;only law, as Baxter justly observes, &quot;he
          ever ordained on the subject.&quot; As recorded by Mark, it has the
          following reading:?&quot;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
          gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be
          saved.&quot; This statue is perfectly simple and perspicuous. It
          ordains first, that the gospel shall be preached; secondly, that it
          shall be preached to every creature; thirdly, that all those who
          believe the gospel shall be baptized; and fourthly, it promises that
          those who so believe, and are baptized, shall be saved. These are all
          positive declarations. Every positive necessarily has its negative.
          And does not every one know that the requirement of the positive is,
          as a general rule, the prohibition of the negative? When God commands
          you to do a specified thing, the command embraces that particular
          thing only; and all that is not embraced is, by the very terms of the
          order, necessarily excluded. Especially is forbidden whatever is
          inconsistent with the faithful performance of the duty enjoined. All
          these are self-evident truths. Let them be applied to the law of
          baptism as contained in the commission. Only those are permitted to
          preach who are called of God to the work; they are not allowed to
          preach, as coming from Christ, any thing but the gospel; and those,
          and those alone, who believe the gospel, they are required to baptize.
          The persons to be baptized are minutely described. They are believers.
          Believers therefore, and believers only, are to be baptized. A law to
          baptize believers is necessarily confined in its administration to
          believers. It embraces no others. To baptize any others is a violation
          of the law. It is unlawful. It is prohibited. Infants are not
          believers. The baptism of infants supersedes and prevents the baptism
          of believers, and is therefore inconsistent with a faithful compliance
          with the law. Every violation of the law is unlawful, and consequently
          prohibited. Infant baptism is a violation of the law; is therefore
          unlawful; and consequently by the law itself, clearly prohibited.
          Infant baptism, thirdly, is prohibited by the very nature and design
          of baptism. This ordinance was instituted and enjoined as the form in
          which you publicly profess your faith in Christ, and devote yourself
          to his service. Paul so teaches when he says, &quot;As many of you as
          have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&quot; Episcopalians
          and Methodists consent to this truth when they concur in the
          declaration that it &quot;is a sign of profession, and a mark of
          difference, whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are
          not baptized.&quot;16 Presbyterians and Congregationalists, of all
          classes, regard it as &quot;not only for the solemn admission of the
          party baptized into the visible church, but also,&quot; of &quot;his
          giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of
          life.&quot;17 In this great fact, therefore, all parties are in theory
          agreed. I now submit the inquiry whether such a profession of faith,
          and devotion to Christ, as baptism expresses, must not necessarily be
          a voluntary and intelligent act, on the part of the baptized? To me no
          fact appears more certain. To those who are incapable of such
          voluntary and intelligent action, baptism can never be administered.
          Infants cannot profess their faith, even if they had any faith to
          profess. They cannot devote themselves to Christ. By the very nature
          of the ordinance, therefore, since they are incapable of compliance
          with its demands, they cannot be baptized. Any baptism which is
          unreasonable and inconsistent, because it does not embrace the design,
          nor express the sense of the ordinance, is unlawful, and therefore
          prohibited. Infant baptism is unreasonable and inconsistent, because
          it does not embrace the design, nor express the sense of the
          ordinance. It is therefore unlawful. It is prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must now, I think, be evident to every unprejudiced mind that
          infant baptism is by the word of God actually prohibited. It is
          prohibited by the fact that it is unrecognized in the sacred records,
          as a divine institution; it is prohibited by the terms of the
          apostolic commission; and it is prohibited by the very nature and
          design of baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          My proposition is thus fully established. We have seen that
          &quot;Infant baptism is not supported by the word of God,&quot;
          because it is not found to be instituted, or in any manner authorized
          in the inspired records; because the different sects who imagine that
          they find it there, prove the contrary by their mutual refutation of
          each other; because the most pious and learned among pedobaptists
          themselves, confess it is not directly taught in the sacred writings;
          because the great Christian axiom which teaches that the divine word
          is our sole authority in religion, does not permit us to receive as
          scriptural what is not recognized in the scriptures; because the
          attempt to make it a divine institution by the testimony of the
          Fathers, through the medium of tradition, is a miserable failure; and
          because it is really and distinctly forbidden in the word of God.
          Infant. baptism is, in truth, therefore, no baptism at all. God in his
          word, does not recognize it as baptism. It never can be recognized as
          baptism by the people of God. It is exclusively an institution of men
          foisted surreptitiously into the religion of Christ. It is therefore a
          most appalling evil. Some of the forms and bearings of this evil may
          now not improperly be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          It betrays ministers into most fearful presumption. When an infant is
          baptized the minister performs the rite professedly, in the name, and
          by the authority of Jesus Christ! But Jesus Christ never authorized
          any such thing! On the contrary, he has discountenanced and forbidden
          it! What then, shall be said of the act? What magistrate in civil
          society would venture, under pretense of law, to do a thing, and
          especially in his official capacity, for the sanction of which no law
          could be produced, and which by existing laws, according to any
          reasonable interpretation, is plainly prohibited? Such an officer
          would act most presumptuously. He would violate his trust. In what
          well-regulated community would his administration long be endured? And
          shall ministers of religion thus conduct themselves, and that too
          without compunction, and without rebuke? In this unauthorized and
          prohibited ceremony of infant baptism, shall they not only meet no
          discountenance, but on the contrary be sustained, and defended? How
          can a conscientious servant of Christ occupy a position so revolting,
          and abhorrent?
        </p>
        <p>
          But ministers are not alone concerned in this evil. Infant baptism
          must create in the minds of the people generally, who are under its
          influence, a want of proper respect for the word of God. The habit of
          acting without law, and in opposition to law, leads to this result
          inevitably. This truth is so obvious that no argument is needed in its
          support. May men do, under pretense of law, the most important acts
          for which no law can be produced? May they indeed, do all these
          things, and be sustained in them, even in opposition to law? How long
          then, will it be to them a matter of any special concern what the law
          may require? They are not obliged to conform to its demands. They may
          do what they please with impunity, without regard to law! Do they any
          longer yield a due respect to the law?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do they feel for it any special deference? Assuredly they do not. In
          civil society this is true, and it is pre-eminently true in religion.
          Infant baptism necessarily destroys respect for the authority of the
          word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evil is still more striking in the fact, that it is a bold attempt
          to perfect that which it is vainly conceived God has left imperfect.
          It is greatly more criminal to do in the name of Jesus Christ, what he
          has not commanded, than it is not to do what he has commanded, since
          when you fall short you thereby confess the difficulty of obedience,
          but when you go beyond, you impugn his wisdom. In the former case you
          acknowledge your own deplorable weakness. In the latter, and
          especially when you claim what he has not authorized or permitted as a
          part of his religion, you madly charge him with defectiveness, and
          attempt by additions of your own, to make his government more
          complete. Why did he not ordain infant baptism? Evidently because he
          did not design that his religion should embrace any such ordinance.
          You have discovered that it is necessary, and have therefore added it!
          You saw that it was demanded to make God?s appointments complete! You
          know better than Jehovah, what is requisite to give perfection to his
          religion!
        </p>
        <p>
          Who, in view of all these facts, can avoid the conclusion that infant
          baptism is a sin against God? What is sin? Is it not any thought,
          word, action, omission, or desire contrary to the law of God?18
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Sin is the transgression of the law.&quot; (1 John 3:4).</p>
        <p>
          Infant baptism is not according to the law of God. It is a violation
          of the law of God. It is the transgression of the law of God.
          Therefore infant baptism is a sin against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some of the forms in which, as an ordinance not instituted,
          nor sanctioned by Jesus Christ, the evil of infant baptism is
          developed. Its practice betrays ministers into fearful presumption; it
          creates a want of respect for the divine law; it charges imperfection
          upon the institutions of Messiah; and it is a sin against God. Infant
          baptism is unsupported by the word of God. It is therefore a great and
          fearful evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion permit me to entreat for these facts and arguments, your
          patient, unbiased, and prayerful consideration. You fervently desire
          to glorify God, and in all things to do his will. You have no wish to
          depart in any respect from the divine law. You would not encumber
          religion, much less pollute it, with any doctrines, or observances,
          not sanctioned from on high. You must therefore, remove infant baptism
          from its place in your theological system. While it remains there, it
          will continue to produce its natural fruits. Its extirpation only, can
          relieve you from its inherent evil. Humbly receive, and diligently
          practice the religion of Christ, guided in all things, exclusively by
          his most holy word, and infant baptism will be known no more. To the
          ascertained will of our Heavenly Father meekly submit yourself. Upon
          this principle alone is it possible for you to &quot;keep the
          commandments of the Lord your God which he commanded you.&quot;
          &quot;Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the
          fat of rams.&quot; But rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and
          stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.&quot;
