        <h2>2. Its defense leads to injurious perversions of Scripture.</h2>
        <p>
          The general principle; instances in illustration, from the apostolic
          commission; from Peter?s sermon; from Paul?s instructions to the
          Corinthians; from Christ?s blessing the children; forms of the evil
        </p>
        <p>
          THE defense of infant baptism, unsustained as it is by divine
          authority, necessarily leads to most injurious perversions of the word
          of God. The same may be said also, of every other departure from
          truth, to support which a resort is had to the sacred record. The evil
          resulting will of course, be in proportion to the magnitude, and
          peculiar bearing, of the error sought to be established. Infant
          baptism is not a mere ceremony, which when performed, ceases to be of
          any further importance. Considered in itself, it may indeed seem of
          little consequence. It is not however thus isolated. Its relations,
          and influences extend themselves into every department of
          Christianity. It is the process by which the churches which practice
          it, receive their entire membership, and must therefore enstamp upon
          them all, its own peculiar character. It leads to insidious and
          hurtful expositions of scripture; imposes upon the people false
          doctrines; subverts the true ecclesiastical polity; corrupts the
          spirit of religion; vitiates Christian intercourse; weakens the power
          of the gospel; and hinders the conversion, and salvation of men. Like
          an error in the beginning of a mathematical calculation, it runs
          through the whole process, continually increasing in magnitude as it
          advances, until every part of it is involved in hopeless confusion.
          How then, can infant baptism be taught and defended without most
          injurious perversions of the word of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          In proof of the proposition now before you, I will point you to
          appropriate examples. But these are so numerous that I know not where
          to begin. A proper exposition of them all would require a volume. In
          the space allowed to this chapter it is not practicable to do more
          than briefly to refer to a few instances. These, however, of
          themselves, will be sufficient to establish the truth of the
          proposition now before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostolic commission, which I had occasion in the preceding
          chapter to recite, has been confidently claimed as a law for the
          baptism of infants. &quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
          baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
          Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
          commanded you; and lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the
          world.&quot; This is the version of Matthew. That of Mark is as
          follows:?&quot;And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and
          preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is
          baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be
          damned.&quot; How plain! How perspicuous! How comprehensive! To
          mistake its sense would seem almost impossible. The solemn obligations
          thus imposed, are to be faithfully and always obeyed by both the
          teachers, and the taught. And let it not be forgotten that the several
          parts of the commission are to be observed in the order in which they
          are enjoined. The order is plainly as imperative as the commands
          themselves. A violation of the order is indeed a violation of the
          commands. This interpretation so evidently correct, is not peculiar to
          Baptists. Pedobaptists also give it their concurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baxter, for example, says:?&quot;This is not like some occasional
          historical mention of baptism, but is the very commission of Christ to
          his apostles, and purposely expresseth their several works in their
          several places and order.&quot; &quot;To contemn this order, is to
          renounce all rules of order; for where can we expect to find it if not
          here?&quot;1 Each duty in the commission must therefore be observed in
          the order in which it is enjoined. Thus far all is simple and obvious.
          The commission is evidently, as before seen, a law to baptize
          believers, and believers only.
        </p>
        <p>
          By what kind of process, we now inquire, can it be possibly made to
          appear, that this law to baptize believers is a law to baptize
          infants? Pedobaptists shall themselves answer, and in their own words.
          &quot;In this commission to his apostles,&quot; says Dr. Worcester,
          &quot;his direction was that all nations should be baptized, and
          children constitute a part of all nations;&quot; therefore children
          are to be baptized.2 Dr. John Edwards remarks:?&quot;This general
          commission includes all particulars. Go baptize all nations, is as
          much, and as full, as if Christ had said, Go baptize all, men, women,
          and children.&quot;3 Matthew Henry observes:?&quot;If it be the will
          and command of the Lord Jesus that all nations should be discipled by
          baptism, and children, a part of all nations, are not excepted, then
          children are to be discipled by baptism.4 These are fair examples of
          their teaching; and of the manner in which they bring infant baptism
          into the commission of Christ to his apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider these expositions attentively. How evident the perversions
          they contain! Were the apostles directed to baptize all nations
          without respect to moral character, or any other religious
          qualification? Surely not. Is the commission a command in other words,
          to &quot;baptize all, men, women, and children?&quot; Preposterous
          claim! If infants are not in the commission &quot;excepted&quot; in
          express terms from baptism, are they therefore to be baptized? How
          surprising the pretension! Is any one ever &quot;discipled by
          baptism?&quot; To disciple is to teach. To teach is one thing. To
          baptize is another. They are not the same thing. To pretend then, that
          any one is &quot;discipled by baptism&quot; is nonsense. Here we have
          four perversions of this portion of the word of God, all palpable, and
          all made evidently for no other reason than to defend infant baptism.
          When great and good men, such as these, and the thousands of others
          who agree with them, thus interpret the commission, we cannot but
          lament the blindness of mind into which this pernicious error has
          betrayed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One striking instance is now before you of the perversion of the word
          of God, made for the sake of defending infant baptism. Take if you
          please, another. In a learned and very elaborate work recently
          published, by a distinguished clergyman of the Episcopal church, we
          have the following passage:?&quot;The chief scripture ground upon
          which it [infant baptism] is placed, is the text,
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The promise is unto you, and your children.&quot;?Acts 2:39.
        </p>
        <p>
          And one of its best supports is St. Paul?s statement that the children
          of a believing parent are in a certain sense holy.?1 Corinthians
          7:14.5 We have here therefore, as claimed by pedobaptists themselves,
          the two passages which are, the one their &quot;chief scripture
          ground&quot; for infant baptism, and the other &quot;its best
          support.&quot; We will therefore, briefly examine them both, and see
          to what extent they have been perverted for the defense of the rite in
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The promise is to you, and to your children.&quot; (Acts 2:39.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This text we are told, is the chief scripture ground upon which infant
          baptism is placed.&quot; That you may understand it perfectly, I will
          refresh your memory with the circumstances under which this inspired
          declaration occurred. It was uttered by Peter, in Jerusalem, during
          the ever memorable Pentecost. Multitudes had on that day, been called
          together by &quot;the signs, and wonders, and miracles&quot; resulting
          from the fulfillment of the promise of God in the gift of the Holy
          Ghost. This intrepid apostle seized the occasion to preach Christ to
          the people. His sermon evinced great power, and was attended with
          singular success. Large numbers were convicted of sin, and in the
          anguish of their heart cried out:?&quot;What shall we do?&quot; In the
          strictest consonance with the apostolic commission, and almost in its
          very words, he answered: &quot;Repent, and be baptized every one of
          you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye
          shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is to you,
          and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as
          the Lord our God shall call.&quot; What, I now inquire, was the
          promise of which the apostle here spoke? It was undoubtedly, the gift
          of the Holy Ghost. Peter himself so declares.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;This is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel: (Joel
          2:2832.) And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
          pour out of my spirit upon all. flesh; and your sons and your
          daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and
          your old men shall dream dreams; and on my servants, and on my
          handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit.&quot;
          &quot;And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name
          of the Lord shall be saved.&quot; (Acts 2:16-21.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is decided therefore that the promise was the Holy Ghost, whose
          influences as predicted by Joel especially, were at that moment seen
          so conspicuously among the people. This truth is indubitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To whom, I next ask, was this promise made? Peter answers, &quot;To
          you Jews, and to your children, and to all that are afar off.&quot;
          The words of the promise in Joel, recited by Peter, are, To you Jews,
          and to &quot;your sons and your daughters.&quot; By
          &quot;children&quot; therefore, the apostle means &quot;sons and
          daughters,&quot; or in general terms, posterity. (tekna) The gentile
          nations are in other places of the scriptures spoken of as &quot;them
          that are afar off.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They are, therefore, the persons alluded to in that form of language.
          But was it the promise of God that all or any these classes of
          persons, who in reality included &quot;all flesh,&quot; should receive
          the Holy Ghost in the times of Messiah?&quot;the last
          days&quot;?unconditionally? No one will surely maintain that it was,
          and especially since these very conditions were explicitly stated.
          They were according to Joel, that the persons in question should
          &quot;call on the name of the Lord.&quot; Peter instructs us that by
          calling on the name of the Lord is implied, that they should
          &quot;repent, and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; The
          promise was to be fulfilled to all those who should comply with these
          conditions, and to none others. If you Jews repent of your sins, and
          by baptism profess your faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, you shall
          receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is to you. If your
          &quot;children,&quot; or as Joel calls them, &quot;your sons and your
          daughters,&quot; repent of their sins, and by baptism profess their
          faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall receive the gift of the
          Holy Ghost, for the promise is to your children. Nor are these
          privileges and blessings to be confined to your nation. They are to be
          extended to &quot;them that are afar off,&quot; to &quot;all
          flesh,&quot; to &quot;every creature,&quot; to all nations,&quot; to
          as many as the Lord our God shall call by his gospel, and who shall
          repent and be baptized, no matter to what people they belong. They
          also shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is to
          them. To that anxious multitude how full of encouragement was this
          precious gospel message! It fell upon their hearts like gentle showers
          upon the parched earth. Hope sprang up in the bosoms of about three
          thousand, who gladly received the word.&quot; They believed it; they
          acted upon it; they became the subjects of renewing grace, and
          received the Holy Ghost, according to the promise of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, briefly, I have submitted the sense of the passage, and that it
          is the true sense it seems to me impossible to doubt. In what part of
          it is infant baptism taught? Not the remotest reference is found to
          any such thing. Yet say our friends, &quot;it is the chief scripture
          ground for infant baptism!&quot; How is it possible for them to make
          good this assertion? It cannot be done. But you shall hear their
          arguments. They shall speak for themselves. Mr. Henry gives the
          meaning of this passage as follows. Peter, he asserts, intends to say,
          in other words, to the people:?&quot;Your children shall have, as they
          have had, an interest in the covenant, and a title to the external
          seal of it. Come over to Christ to receive those inestimable benefits;
          for the promise of the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy
          Ghost, is to you, and to your children.&quot; &quot;When God took
          Abraham into covenant he said, I will be a God to thee, and to thy
          seed;?Genesis 17:7?and accordingly every Israelite had his son
          circumcised at eight days old. Now it is proper for an Israelite, when
          he is by baptism to come into a new dispensation of this covenant, to
          ask, What shall I do with my children? Must they be thrown out, or
          taken in with me? Taken in, says Peter, by all means; for the promise,
          the great promise of God?s being to you a God, is as much to you and
          your children now, as ever it was.6
        </p>
        <p>
          Who that possesses any tolerable knowledge of the scriptures could
          readily imagine that learned and good men would venture this as the
          sense of the passage in question? It is crowded in nearly every line,
          with absurdities and perversions. Let them be separately, and more
          particularly designated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, the representation that the word
          &quot;children&quot; in the passage means the babes of those then
          present is absurd for three reasons; first, because Joel says they
          were their sons and their daughters, who should then prophesy; and
          Peter did not intend to contradict Joel: secondly, because their babes
          could not fulfill the conditions upon which the promise was made: and
          thirdly, because of the nature of the promise itself, which was that
          they should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and prophesy. The word
          &quot;children&quot; is unquestionably used by Peter, in the sense of
          posterity simply. This fact is so obvious that it is frankly conceded
          by some of the best biblical critics among the pedobaptists
          themselves. Dr. Whitby says:?&quot;These words will not prove a right
          of infants to receive baptism, the promise here being that of the Holy
          Ghost mentioned in verses 16, 17, 18, and so relating only to the
          times of the miraculous effusions of the Holy Ghost, and to those
          persons who by age were capable of these extraordinary gifts.&quot;7
          Limborch of Amsterdam, says:?&quot;By children the apostle understands
          not infants, but posterity.&quot; &quot;Whence it appears that the
          argument which is commonly taken from this passage for the baptism of
          infants is of no force, and good for nothing.&quot;8 With these
          distinguished interpreters agree Doddridge, Hammond, and many others.
          To represent Peter therefore, as referring to infant children, and
          inculcating their baptism, is a most injurious perversion of the word
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second perversion is found in the implication that the faith and
          baptism, of their parents, were the conditions upon which their infant
          children were to receive the Holy Ghost, and the remission of sins.
          This passage teaches no such thing. Our pedobaptist brethren however
          represent Peter as saying in other words, to the Jews there under
          conviction of sin, and whom they, singularly enough, suppose to be
          inquiring, &quot;What must I do with my children;&quot; &quot;Come
          over to Christ to receive these inestimable benefits; for the promise
          of the remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, is to you
          and to your children.&quot; Do you join the church of Christ, and your
          children, by virtue of their relation to you, shall be entitled to the
          same blessings you receive. They shall share with you every gospel
          blessing, and especially &quot;the remission of sins, and the gift of
          the Holy Ghost.&quot; Do not hesitate therefore; &quot;come over to
          Christ.&quot; What a monstrous perversion!
        </p>
        <p>
          A third perversion of this passage is committed. Our Pedobaptist
          brethren insist that the promise in question, relates to the blessings
          pledged in the covenant with Abraham. The promise as stated by Peter,
          was the gift of the Holy Ghost to believers. But their version is
          wholly different. They interpret the apostle as saying to the
          Jews:?Your children [infants] shall [still] have as they have had, an
          interest in the covenant [with Abraham] and a title to the external
          seal of it,&quot; all which the gospel gives to you, and consequently
          to them!
        </p>
        <p>
          This short passage is subjected to a fourth perversion. They maintain
          that the gospel covenant is a continuance of the covenant of
          circumcision! Their language is, &quot;When God took Abraham into
          covenant, he said, I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed;?Genesis
          17:7?and accordingly every Israelite had his son circumcised at eight
          days old. Now it is proper for an Israelite when he is to enter into a
          new dispensation of this covenant, to ask, What must be done With my
          children?&quot; And is the gospel a new dispensation of this covenant
          that God made with Abraham, according to which &quot;every Israelite
          had his son circumcised at eight days old? The gospel a new
          dispensation of the covenant of circumcision! And does Peter so teach?
          No such thing appears, either in this text, or elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifth perversion of this passage, and the last I shall mention, is
          the claim that Peter means by &quot;the promise,&quot; that infants
          are to be baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and be taken into the
          church. &quot;An Israelite&quot; is represented as inquiring, If I
          &quot;come over to Christ,&quot; and unite with this gospel church of
          yours, &quot;What must be done with my children? Must they be thrown
          out, or taken in with me?&quot; To this they represent the passage as
          answering?&quot;Taken in, says Peter, by all means; for the promise,
          that great promise of God?s being to you a God, is as much to you and
          your children now, as ever it was.&quot; How manifest a perversion is
          here! Strangely are good men blinded, so blinded by infant baptism,
          that they it seems, really believe that Peter teaches what they
          represent in the passage! Having thus disposed of &quot;the chief
          scripture ground upon which it is placed,&quot; and found that no
          allusion whatever is made in it to infant baptism, we now turn to the
          other passage, which is, &quot;one of its best supports.&quot; This
          &quot;is St. Paul?s statement that the children of a believing parent
          are in a certain sense holy.&quot; In what sense are they holy? To
          comprehend the whole matter perfectly, let us turn to the sacred
          record, and together with its context, read carefully the entire
          passage, &quot;Now concerning the things where of ye wrote unto
          me,&quot; says Paul, and proceeding, he gave various instructions to
          the Corinthians regarding marriage, and domestic duties. Among other
          things he says:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Let not the wife depart from her husband; but if she depart let
          her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the
          husband put away his wife.&quot; &quot;If any brother hath a wife that
          believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put
          her away. And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and
          if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the
          unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving
          wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children unclean,
          but now are they holy. But if the unbelieving depart let him depart. A
          brother, or a sister, is not in bondage in such cases; but God hath
          called us to peace. For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt
          save thy husband? Or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
          thy wife? But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
          called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the
          churches.&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:1-17.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We will here pause if you please, until we have ascertained
          definitely, the true sense of this interesting portion of divine
          truth. Paul is without doubt, instructing the Corinthians regarding
          their conjugal, domestic, and social relations. This fact no one can
          rationally question. On these topics they needed to be enlightened,
          since they were evidently disposed to go astray. By some means,
          probably the instructions of Judaizing teachers among them, the church
          had, it seems, become agitated with the question whether the old
          Jewish law which required Israel to regard all gentiles as unclean,
          and their touch polluting, which in a word prohibited all familiar
          intercourse with them, ought not to govern Christians in their
          relations with unbelievers. Should not the church regard all who are
          not members as unclean to them in the same sense that gentiles were
          formerly looked upon as unclean to Jews? To this opinion the brethren
          of Corinth appear to have strongly inclined. They soon saw, however,
          that such a rule of intercourse if adopted among them, must be
          attended with the gravest consequences. It would not only sever their
          social and domestic relations, but would actually break up and destroy
          their families, since some of them were married to unbelievers, from
          whom of course, they must instantly separate. That this was the true
          state of the case, and the actual question submitted by them to the
          apostle, is so plain, from his answer alone, that it is confessed by
          some of the Pedobaptist commentators and divines themselves. Even
          Henry, for instance, could not avoid seeing it. He says:?&quot;They
          thought that (the unconverted members of their families) would be
          common, or unclean, in the same sense as heathens in general were
          styled in the apostle vision.&quot;9 Dr. Miller, notwithstanding his
          prejudices, is still more full. He says:?&quot;It appears that among
          the Corinthians to whom the apostle wrote, there were many cases of
          professing Christians being united by the marriage tie with pagans;
          the former being perhaps converted after marriage, or being so unwise
          as after conversion deliberately to form this unequal and unhappy
          connection. What was to be deemed of such marriages seems to have been
          the grave question submitted to this inspired teacher.&quot;10 Upon
          this point therefore, we are certainly right.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the perplexing circumstances under which they wrote to Paul
          for advice. He answered them in substance, that the old Jewish law
          regulating intercourse with gentiles, was not applicable to them, not
          only because the ceremonial dispensation to which it exclusively
          belonged had passed away, but also because in their case, (and the
          same was true of all other churches,) its observance was
          impracticable. Any attempts to enforce it, must have been attended
          with the most disastrous consequences. The Christians, unlike the
          Jews, lived, and must live, in the midst of unbelievers. Many of them
          were connected with their families, and were a part of them. With such
          persons they could not avoid contact, and association. If such
          separation was necessary to preserve their Christian purity, then to
          retain it they &quot;must needs go out of the world.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But especially some of them were married to unbelievers, and if this
          abrogated Jewish law was to be enforced all such husbands and wives
          must part from each other. But this was not demanded by the gospel,
          and ought not to take place, unless the temper of the unbelieving
          party should render it necessary. &quot;If any brother hath a wife
          that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not
          put her away. And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not,
          if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.&quot;
          &quot;But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
          sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God hath called us to
          peace.&quot; Believers and unbelievers who are husband and wife, may
          lawfully, and ought to continue to dwell together. No such rule of
          ceremonial holiness, and uncleanness, obtains under the gospel as that
          which characterized the Mosaic economy. The marriage tie makes the
          parties, though it unite a believer with an unbeliever, holy to each
          other. The unbelieving husband is not unclean so that the believing
          wife may not lawfully dwell with him. The unbelieving wife is not
          unclean so that the believing husband may not lawfully dwell with her.
          Why then separate? Let them remain together. And for their continued
          union there is yet another most important reason. God may perhaps,
          bless the efforts of the believing, to the conversion and salvation of
          the unbelieving party.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet more. Must the believing husband or wife separate from the
          unbelieving, for the reasons alleged? Then it will follow that, for
          the very same reasons, the believing parent must also separate from
          his own children, since they also are not believers! Indeed, not a
          member of the church, if separation from all unbelievers is necessary
          to preserve his Christian purity, must touch his own children, eat
          with them, or associate with them. The believing parent occupies, in
          this respect, precisely the same relation to his child that he does to
          his unbelieving wife. Must he separate from his wife? He must also
          separate from his child. But you do not, said Paul, consider your
          children unclean to you, but holy. You do not, you must not, humanity
          forbids that you should, consider their touch polluting. They are
          sanctified, holy, clean, to you. So also the unbelieving wife is
          sanctified, holy, clean to you. You must not separate from your child.
          Therefore you must not separate from your wife. &quot;The unbelieving
          husband is sanctified to11 the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
          sanctified to the husband, else were your children unclean [to you],
          but now they are holy&quot; to you. Therefore the unbelieving wife is
          holy to you. In the same way that the child is holy to the believing
          parent, the unbelieving husband is holy to the believing wife, and the
          unbelieving wife is holy to the believing husband. You may lawfully
          remain with your children. You may therefore lawfully remain with each
          other. Throw aside these absurd notions about the old Jewish law of
          ceremonial purity. Dwell together in the conjugal relation. &quot;As
          God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one,
          so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.&quot; Is not
          this a true exposition of the sense of the apostle? It is
          self-evident. Some few of the more learned pedobaptist divines have
          seen and confessed it. Dressier, for example, says:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;According to Paul a holy pedigree is nothing in religion.
          Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing, but
          keeping the commandment of God. The passage 1 Corinthians 7:13-14,
          [that now before us] does not support any such view. He says, if the
          Christians would flee from every unbeliever, regarding him as unclean,
          they must flee from their own children, and hold them as unclean, for
          they were among the unbelievers. ?Otherwise your children would be
          unclean,? for they are not Christians by birth merely. ?But now are
          they holy,? i.e., you are not to consider yourselves polluted by
          them.&quot;12
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the lesson, in response to their inquiry, taught by Paul to
          his brethren the Corinthians. How beautiful! How important! How
          simple! How easy to be understood! Not the remotest reference is made
          in it in any way, to infant baptism. Yet it is declared to be
          &quot;one of its best supports!&quot; Accordingly our brethren have
          chiefly predicated upon it this declaration in the Westminster
          Confession of Faith?&quot;Not only those that do actually profess
          faith in and obedience unto Christ, but also the infants of one or
          both believing parents are to be baptized.&quot;13 Commenting upon the
          passage, &quot;Else were your children unclean, but now are they
          holy,&quot; Mr. Henry says:?&quot;That is, they would be heathen, out
          of the pale of the church, and covenant of God. They would not be of
          the holy seed.&quot; &quot;The children born to Christians, though
          married to unbelievers, are not part of the world, but of the
          church.&quot;14 On the same passage Dr. Clarke remarks:?&quot;If this
          kind of relative sanctification were not allowed, the children of
          these persons could not be received into the Christian church, nor
          enjoy any rights or privileges as Christians; but the church of God
          never scrupled to admit such children as members.&quot; Dr. Miller,
          after admitting all that we have just seen, still says that Paul
          &quot;pronounces under the direction of the Holy Spirit, that in all
          such cases, when the unbeliever is willing to live with the believer,
          they ought to continue to live together, that their connection is so
          sanctified by the character of the believing companion that their
          children are ?holy? that is, in covenant with God; members of that
          church with which the believing parent is in virtue of his profession
          united; in one word, that the infidel party is so far, and in such a
          sense, consecrated by the believing party, that their children shall
          be reckoned to belong to the sacred family with which the latter is
          connected, and shall be regarded and treated as members of the church
          of God.&quot;15
        </p>
        <p>
          These are specimens of the havoc made of the sense of the word of God
          for the sake ?of infant baptism. Look at the perversions here
          committed. Paul teaches, as they contend, that the offspring of
          parents one of whom is a believer, are born members of the church with
          which the believing parent is connected; that they are born in
          covenant with God; that as such they are entitled to &quot;enjoy the
          right and privileges of Christians;&quot; and that were it not so
          their children &quot;would be heathens!&quot; Here are four palpable
          perversions. None of these propositions are true in themselves; they
          are not sustained at all in the word of God; and especially they are
          not found in the instructions of Paul to the Corinthians. But a still
          greater perversion of this passage, if possible, remains to be
          mentioned. Paul told the Corinthians that as they did not consider
          their children ceremonially unclean or unholy to them, but holy, and
          they therefore took care of them; so the unbelieving party in
          marriage, since she bore the same relation to the believing party with
          the child, was not to be considered by the other ceremonially unclean,
          or unholy, but holy, and they should therefore remain together. No,
          no, Paul! respond our Pedobaptist brethren, this is not what you mean!
          You mean that the holiness of the children is spiritual, that it is
          &quot;ecclesiastical,&quot; and more, you mean that this holiness is
          produced by hereditary transmission, so that the children are born in
          the covenant and church of God, and, since as such they are entitled
          to &quot;enjoy the privileges and rights of Christians,&quot; they are
          to be baptized! Thus boldly do they contradict the apostle himself,
          and greatly also to his injury; since if their interpretation is true
          they make Paul speak nonsense, and bring him into collision with
          himself, and other portions of divine truth. Are the terms unclean,
          sanctified, and holy to be understood in a spiritual, or an
          ecclesiastical sense? They so maintain. It is certain that these words
          are used in the same sense in their application to both parent and
          child. It follows thus, that if the child is to be baptized because
          that relationship makes it holy, as certainly is the unbelieving
          husband, or wife, to be baptized because by the same relationship he,
          or she, is sanctified. He who is sanctified is holy, and the
          sanctified have the same right to baptism with the holy?16 If then you
          baptize the child upon the faith of its mother, you must, to be
          consistent, baptize the unbelieving husband upon the faith of his
          wife, since if the child is holy, so also is the unbelieving father
          sanctified. But it is certain Paul teaches no such doctrine. Paul was
          wise. We have reason to lament that so much cannot be said of very
          many of his professed interpreters.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other passage ought to be considered, and its false glosses
          briefly exposed, since much confidence has of late, been expressed
          that it contains evident authority for infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come
          unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Matthew 19:14.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us, in the first place, carefully examine this text, and ascertain
          its exact Sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Savior was in the midst of a discourse of surpassing interest. His
          disciples were absorbed in their attention to his instructions.
          Suddenly there &quot;were brought unto him little children.&quot; The
          object of those who brought them?probably their parents?the evangelist
          fully states. It was, &quot;That he should put his hands on them, and
          pray.&quot;17 This was a very familiar observance among the Jews.
          Great importance was attached by them, and justly, to the benedictions
          of holy men. To obtain them therefore, when practicable, had been
          common from the earliest times. (Genesis 48:14; Matthew 9:18;. Mark
          16:18.) These parents fully believed that Jesus was a prophet of God,
          and they desired for their children his prayers and blessing. This was
          what they sought, and all that they sought. They however, encountered
          in their approach, a rebuke from the disciples!
        </p>
        <p>
          This occurred, not certainly, from any want of respect on the part of
          the disciples for their motives, and wishes, but evidently because
          they were impatient of the interruption. Their feelings were deeply
          enlisted in the topic before them, and they were not willing that
          their Master should, on any account, be diverted from it. But he,
          observing what they did, &quot;was much displeased,&quot; (Mark
          10:14-16.) and immediately suspending his discourse, &quot;Called the
          little children to him.&quot; (Luke 18:16.) Thus he manifested his
          great love, patience, and condescension. What the Savior did for these
          children is now distinctly and fully stated:?&quot;He took them up in
          his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.&quot; Meantime he
          compensated his disciples: for the interruption, by imparting one of
          the richest lessons to be found in all his teachings. It is contained
          in the very passage now in question:?&quot;Of such is the kingdom of
          heaven.&quot; And he adds:?&quot;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever
          shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no
          wise enter therein.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          By &quot;the kingdom of heaven,&quot; and &quot;the kingdom of
          God,&quot; here employed as convertible terms, our Savior refers to
          the Gospel, the true principles of which in the heart, alone can
          qualify any one for the holy brotherhood of the church upon earth.
          This fact needs only to be stated. But what are we to understand by
          the phrase, &quot;Of such is the kingdom of heaven?&quot; Is it not
          sufficiently explained by the other phrase, &quot;Whosoever shall not
          receive the kingdom of God [the grace offered by Christ] as a little
          child, [in the spirit, and with the disposition of a little child]
          shall in no wise enter therein?&quot; This appears to me most evident.
          He does not say that the kingdom of heaven?the church?belongs to
          little children, or is composed of these, and other such little
          children. Certainly not. This is plain from our present version, but
          in the original it is still more obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word rendered &quot;of such,&quot; (toioutwn, not autwn.) conveys
          the idea, as every scholar must see, of comparison, and does not
          therefore, signify identity, but likeness. The church therefore, is
          made up, not, as Pedobaptists tell us, of little children, but of
          those who by divine grace are made like little children. Only
          &quot;such&quot; can have a place there, as are spiritually, what
          little children are literally. Little children love their parents
          supremely: To fit you for a place in his visible church, you must love
          God supremely. Little children receive as true, and implicitly
          believe, whatever is declared by their parents: You must receive as
          true, and implicitly believe whatever is declared in his word, by God.
          Little children submit themselves to such provisions as are made for
          them by their parents: You must submit yourselves to such arrangements
          as are made for you by God. Little children obey the commandments of
          their parents: You must obey the commandments of God. In these and
          other respects, to qualify you for a place in the kingdom, or church
          of God, you must be like little children. You &quot;receive the
          kingdom of God as a little child&quot; when you cherish the same love,
          faith, submission, and obedience towards God, that little children do
          towards their parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is undoubtedly, the true, and full sense of the passage. How
          evangelical! How rich! Never, as has been said, did the Redeemer
          himself, teach a more important lesson. Let it be observed, however,
          that neither in the passage, nor in the context, nor anywhere else in
          this connection, is there an allusion of any kind even remotely to
          baptism. With these facts and expositions before us, we turn to the
          interpretations of our pedobaptist brethren. What are they? Mr. Henry
          shall again serve as an example of them all.18 He speaks thus:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Observe the faith of those who brought [these children to
          Christ. They were believing parents.] The children of believing
          parents belong to the kingdom of heaven, and are members of the
          visible church. Of such?not only of such in disposition, and
          affection, (that might have served for a reason why doves, or lambs
          should be brought to him,) but of such in age?is the kingdom of
          heaven; to them pertain the privileges of visible church-membership as
          among the Jews of old.&quot; &quot;Parents are trustees of their
          children?s wills, are empowered by nature to transact for their
          benefit, and therefore Christ accepts their dedication of them as
          their [the children?s] act and deed, and will own these dedicated
          things in the day when he makes up his jewels. Therefore he takes it
          ill of those who forbid them, and [who] exclude those [children] whom
          he has received;&quot; &quot;and who forbid water that they [infants]
          should be baptized, who if that promise be fulfilled (Isaiah 44:3) [I
          will pour out my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
          offspring] have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, for aught we
          know.&quot; Look at this gloss! Ponder it! How preposterous! Dr.
          Clarke?s commentary is as follows
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Let every parent that fears God, bring up his children in that
          fear; and by baptism let each be dedicated to the Holy Trinity.
          Whatever is solemnly consecrated to God, abides under his protection
          and blessing.&quot;19
        </p>

          These, and such like, are the Pedobaptist interpretations of the
          passage in question! They are published to the world, and received,
          and defended, as expressing its true sense! Is it surprising
          therefore, that a vail is thus thrown over the gospel, and its great
          truths withheld from the faith of the simple?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now mark if you please, the glaring perversions with which this
          whole Pedobaptist &quot;exposition&quot; is crowded. I shall notice
          six only. It is here denied that Christ designs to illustrate the true
          Christian character by the disposition of children, and it is asserted
          that this might have been done by the dispositions and affections of
          doves, or lambs, as well as by those of children; thus the obvious
          truth is repudiated: it is maintained that Christ here teaches the
          church-membership of literal infants, by natural birth; that parents
          have a natural right to &quot;transact&quot; in religion for their
          children?impose upon them the vows, and ordinance of baptism?and that
          God will accept it as binding upon the children; that in the last day,
          when God shall make up his jewels, persons will be &quot;owned&quot;
          by him, because they were in their infancy &quot;dedicated to the Holy
          Trinity in baptism;&quot; that Christ takes it ill of those who refuse
          to receive infants into the church, and to baptize them; and that
          &quot;for aught we know, infants have received the Holy Ghost as well
          as we,&quot; and ought therefore to be baptized! What perversions!
          What falsifications of truth!
        </p>
        <p>
          We have thus seen how the word of God is perverted in order to sustain
          this unauthorized rite, in the instances of the apostolic commission,
          the address of Peter on the day of pentecost, the instructions of Paul
          to the Corinthians, regarding social and domestic intercourse, and the
          blessing of children by our Lord Jesus Christ. Many, very many other
          examples equally striking, might be produced, but enough has been said
          to establish fully the proposition with which we set out. It is
          unquestionably true that the defense of infant baptism necessarily
          leads to most injurious perversions of the word of God. This is an
          evil, a most melancholy evil. It destroys all just principles of
          biblical interpretation; it covers the sacred oracles with
          impenetrable obscurity; it inculcates error, and withholds the truth
          from the cause and people of God; by it knowledge is abridged; faith
          is made weak; religion becomes less enlightened; and practical
          godliness is overwhelmed!
