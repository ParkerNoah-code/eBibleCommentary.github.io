        <p>List of reasons to reject infant baptism:</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason1.html">1.</a> Its practice is
          unsupported by the word of God.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason2.html">2.</a> Its defense leads to
          injurious perversions of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason3.html">3.</a> It engrafts Judaism upon
          the gospel of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason4.html">4.</a> It falsifies the doctrine
          of universal depravity.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason5.html">5.</a> The doctrines upon which
          it is predicated contradict the great fundamental principle of
          justification by faith.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason6.html">6.</a> It is in direct conflict
          with the doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason7.html">7.</a> It despoils the church of
          those peculiar qualities which are essential to the church of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason8.html">8.</a> Its practice perpetuates
          the superstitions that originally produced it.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason9.html">9.</a> It subverts the scripture
          doctrine of infant salvation.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason10.html">10.</a> It leads its advocates
          into rebellion against the authority of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason11.html">11.</a> The connection it
          assumes with the moral and religious training of children.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason12.html">12.</a> It is the grand
          foundation upon which rests the union of church and state.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason13.html">13.</a> It leads to religious
          persecutions.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason14.html">14.</a> It is contrary to the
          principles of civil and religious freedom.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason15.html">15.</a> It enfeebles the power
          of the church to combat error.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason16.html">16.</a> It injures the credit of
          religion with reflecting men of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason17.html">17.</a> It is the great barrier
          to Christian union.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason18.html">18.</a> It prevents the salutary
          impression which baptism was designed to make upon the minds both of
          those who receive it, and of those who witness its administration.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="InfantBaptism/Reason19.html">19.</a> It retards the designs
          of Christ in the conversion of the world.
