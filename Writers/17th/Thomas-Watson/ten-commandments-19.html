          Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.' Acts
          11: 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repentance seems to be a bitter pill to take, but it is to purge out
          the bad humour of sin. By some Antinomian spirits it is cried down as
          a legal doctrine; but Christ himself preached it. From that time Jesus
          began to preach, and to say, Repent,' &amp;c. Matt 4: 17. In his last
          farewell, when he was ascending to heaven, he commanded that
          Repentance should be preached in his name.' Luke 24: 47. Repentance is
          a pure gospel grace. The covenant of works would not admit of
          repentance; it cursed all that could not perform perfect and personal
          obedience. Gal 3: 10. Repentance comes in by the gospel; it is the
          fruit of Christ's purchase that repenting sinners shall be saved. It
          is wrought by the ministry of the gospel, while it sets before our
          eyes Christ crucified. It is not arbitrary, but necessary; there is no
          being saved without it. Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
          perish.' Luke 13: 3. We may be thankful to God that he has left us
          this plank after shipwreck.
        </p>
        <p>I. I shall show first the counterfeits of repentance.</p>
        <p>
          Natural softness and tenderness of spirit. Some have a tender
          affection, arising from their constitution, whereby they are apt to
          weep and relent when they see any object of pity. These are not
          repenting tears: for many weep to see another's misery, who cannot
          weep at their own sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legal terrors. A man who has lived in a course of sin, at last is made
          sensible; he sees hell ready to devour him, and is filled with anguish
          and horror; but after a while the tempest of conscience is blown over,
          and he is quiet. He then concludes he is a true penitent, because he
          has felt some bitterness in sin, but this is not repentance. Judas had
          some trouble of mind. If anguish and trouble were sufficient for
          repentance, then the damned would be most penitent, for they are most
          in anguish of mind. There may be trouble of mind where there is no
          grieving for the offence against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slight superficial sorrow. When God's hand lies heavy upon a man, as
          when he is sick or lame, he may vent a sigh or tear, and say, Lord,
          have mercy;' yet this is not true repentance. Ahab did more than all
          this. He rent his clothes, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went
          softly.' 1 Kings 21: 27. His clothes were rent, but not his heart. The
          eye may be watery, and the heart flinty. An apricot may be soft
          without, but it has a hard stone within.
        </p>
        <p>
          God motions rising in the heart. Every good motion is not repentance.
          Some think if they have motions in their hearts to break off their
          sins, and become religious, it is repentance. As the devil may stir up
          bad motions in the godly, so the Spirit of God may stir up good
          motions in the wicked. Herod had many good thoughts and inclinations
          stirred up in him by John Baptist's preaching, yet he did not truly
          repent, for he still lived in incest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vows and resolutions. What vows and solemn protestations do some make
          in their sickness, that if God should recover them they will be new
          men, but afterwards they are as bad as ever! Thou saidst, I will not
          transgress;' here was a resolution: but for all this, she ran after
          her idols. Under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.'
          Jer 2: 20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving off some gross sin. (1) A man may leave off some sins, and
          keep others. Herod reformed many things that were amiss, but kept his
          Herodias. (2) An old sin may be left to entertain a new one. A man may
          leave off riot and prodigality, and turn covetous; which is merely to
          exchange one sin for another.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the counterfeits of repentance. Now, if you find that yours
          is a counterfeit repentance, and you have not repented aright, mend
          what you have done amiss. As in the body, if a bone be set wrong, the
          surgeon has no way but to break it again, and set it aright; so you
          must do by repentance; if you have not repented aright, you must have
          your heart broken again in a godly manner, and be more deeply
          afflicted for sin than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me to show wherein repentance consists. It consists in
          two things: humiliation and transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humiliation. If their uncircumcised hearts be humbled.' Lev 26: 41.
          There is, as the schoolmen say, a twofold humiliation, or breaking of
          the heart. (1) Attrition; as when a rock is broken in pieces. This is
          done by the law, which is a hammer to break the heart. (2) Contrition;
          as when ice is melted into water. This is done by the gospel, which is
          as a fire to melt the heart.' Jer 23: 9. The sense of abused kindness
          causes contrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transformation, or change. Be ye transformed by the renewing of your
          mind.' Rom 12: 2. Repentance works a change in the whole man. As when
          wine is put into a glass of water, it runs into every part of the
          water, and changes its colour and taste; so true repentance does not
          rest in one part, but diffuses and spreads itself into every part.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Repentance causes a change in the mind. Before, a man liked sin
          well, and said in defence of it, as Jonah, I do well to be angry;'
          chap 4: 9; or I did well to swear, and break the Sabbath. When he
          becomes penitent, his judgement is changed, he looks upon sin as the
          greatest evil. The Greek word for repentance signifies after-wisdom;
          when, having seen how deformed and damnable a thing sin is, we change
          our mind. Paul, before conversion, verily thought he ought to do many
          things contrary to the name of Jesus (Acts 26: 9); but, when he became
          a penitent, he was of another mind. I count all things but loss for
          the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.' Phil 3: 8.
          Repentance causes a change of judgement.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Repentance causes a change in the affections, which move under the
          will as the commander-in-chief. It metamorphoses the affections. It
          turns rejoicing in sin into sorrowing for sin; it turns boldness in
          sin into holy shame; it turns the love of sin into hatred. As Ammon
          hated Tamar more than ever he loved her (2 Sam 13: 15), so the true
          penitent hates sin more than ever he loved it. I hate every false
          way.' Psa 119: 104.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Repentance works a change in the life. Though repentance begins at
          the heart, it does rest there, but goes into the life. It begins at
          the heart. O Jerusalem, wash thy heart.' Jer 4: 14. If the spring be
          corrupt, no pure stream can run from it. But though repentance begins
          at the heart, it does not rest there, but changes the life. What a
          change did repentance make in Paul! It changed a persecutor into a
          preacher. What a change did it make in the jailer! Acts 16: 33. He
          took Paul and Silas, and washed their stripes, and set meat before
          them. What a change did it make in Mary Magdalene! She who before
          kissed her lovers with wanton embraces, now kisses Christ's feet; she
          that used to curl her hair, and dress it with costly jewels, now makes
          it a towel to wipe Christ's feet; her eyes that used to sparkle with
          lust, and with impure glances to entice her lovers, now become
          fountains of tears to wash her Saviour's feet; her tongue that used to
          speak vainly and loosely, now is an instrument set in tune to praise
          God. This change of life has two things in it: --
        </p>
        <p>
          The terminus a quo, a breaking off sin. Break off thy sins by
          righteousness.' Dan 4: 27. This breaking off sin must have three
          qualifications. (1) It must be universal, a breaking off all sin. One
          disease may kill as well as more. One sin lived in, may damn as well
          as more. The real penitent breaks off secret, gainful, habitual sins;
          he takes the sacrificing knife of mortification, and runs it through
          the heart of his dearest lusts. (2) Breaking off sin must be sincere;
          it must not be out of fear, but upon spiritual grounds; as from
          antipathy and disgust, and a principle of love to God. If sin had not
          such evil effects, a true penitent would forsake it out of love to
          God. The best way to separate things that are frozen, is by fire. When
          sin and the heart are frozen together, the best way to separate them
          is by the fire of love. Shall I sin against a gracious Father, and
          abuse that love which pardons me? (3) The breaking off sin must be
          perpetual, so as never to have to do with sin any more. What have I to
          do any more with idols?' Hos 14: 8. Repentance is a spiritual divorce,
          which must be till death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change of life has in it terminus ad quem, a returning unto the Lord.
          It is called Repentance towards God.' Acts 20: 21. It is not enough,
          when we repent, to leave old sins; but we must engage in God's
          service; as when the wind leaves the west, it turns into a contrary
          corner. The repenting prodigal not only left his harlots, but arose
          and went to his father. Luke 15: 18. In true repentance the heart
          points directly to God, as the needle to the north pole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use. Let us all set upon this great work of repentance; let us repent
          sincerely and speedily: let us repent of all our sins, our pride, rash
          anger, and unbelief. Without repentance, no remission.' It is not
          consistent with the holiness of God's nature to pardon a sinner while
          he is in the act of rebellion. O meet God, not with weapons, but tears
          in your eyes. To stir you up to a melting penitent frame: --
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Consider what there is in sin, that you should continue in the
          practice of it. It is the accursed thing.' Josh 7: 11. It is the
          spirits of mischief distilled. It defiles the soul's glory; it is like
          a stain to beauty. It is compared to a plague-sore.1 Kings 8: 38.
          Nothing so changes one's glory into shame as sin. Without repentance
          sin tends to final damnation. Peccatum transit actu, manet reatu [The
          moment of sin passes, the guilt remains]. Sin at first shows its
          colour in the glass, but afterwards it bites like a serpent. Those
          locusts in Rev 9: 7, are an emblem of sin: On their heads were crowns
          like gold, and they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth
          were as the teeth of lions, and there were stings in their tails.' Sin
          unrepented of ends in a tragedy. It has the devil for its father,
          shame for its companion, and death for its wages. Rom 6: 23. What is
          there in sin then, that men should continue in it? Say not it is
          sweet. Who would desire the pleasure which kills?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Repentance is very pleasing to God. No sacrifice like a broken
          heart. A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.'
          Psa 51: 17. Augustine caused this sentence to be written over his bed
          when he was sick. When the widow brought empty vessels to Elisha, the
          oil was poured into them.2 Kings 4: 6. Bring God the broken vessel of
          a contrite heart, and he will pour in the oil of mercy. Repenting
          tears are the joy of God and of angels. Luke 15: 7. Doves delight to
          be about the waters; and surely God's Spirit, who once descended in
          the likeness of a dove, takes great delight in the waters of
          repentance. Mary stood at Jesus' feet weeping. Luke 7: 38. She brought
          two things to Christ, tears and ointment; but her tears were more
          precious to Christ than her ointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Repentance ushers in pardon. Therefore they are joined together.
          Repentance and remission.' Luke 24: 47. Pardon of sin is the richest
          blessing; it is enough to make a sick man well. The inhabitant shall
          not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven
          their iniquity.' Isa 33: 24. Pardon settles upon us the richer charter
          of the promises. Pardoning mercy is the sauce that makes all other
          mercies relish the sweeter; it sweetens our health, riches, and
          honour. David had a crown of pure gold set upon his head. Psa 21: 3.
          That which David most blessed God for, was not that God had set a
          crown of gold upon his head, but that he had set a crown of mercy upon
          his head. Who crowneth thee with mercies.' Psa 103: 4. What was this
          crown of mercy? You may see in ver 3: Who forgiveth all thine
          iniquities.' David more rejoiced that he was crowned with forgiveness
          than that he wore a crown of pure gold. Now, what is it that makes way
          for pardon of sin but repentance? When David's soul was humbled and
          broken, the prophet Nathan brought him good news. The Lord has put
          away thy sin.' 2 Sam 12: 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my sins are so great, that if I should repent, God would not
          pardon them!
        </p>
        <p>
          God will not go from his promise. Return, thou backsliding Israel,
          saith the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you, for
          I am merciful.' Jer 3: 12. If thy sins are as rocks, yet upon thy
          repentance, the sea of God's mercy can drown them. Wash you, make you
          clean.' Isa 1: 16. Wash in the lever of repentance. Come now, and let
          us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet,
          they shall be as white as snow;' ver 18. Manasseh was a crimson
          sinner; but when he humbled himself greatly, the golden sceptre of
          mercy was held forth. When his head was a fountain to weep for sin,
          Christ's side was a fountain to wash away sin. It is not the greatness
          of sin, but impenitence, that destroys. The Jews, who had a hand in
          crucifying Christ, upon their repentance found the blood they had shed
          was a sovereign balm to heal them. When the prodigal came home to his
          father, he had the robe and the ring put upon him, and his father
          kissed him.' Luke 15: 20, 22. If you break off your sins, God will
          become a friend to you; all that is in God shall be yours; his power
          shall be yours, to help you; his wisdom shall be yours, to counsel
          you; his Spirit shall be yours, to sanctify you; his promises shall be
          yours, to comfort you; his angels shall be yours, to guard you; his
          mercy shall be yours, to save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) There is much sweetness in repenting tears. The soul is never more
          enlarged and inwardly delighted than when it can melt kindly for sin.
          Weeping days are festival days. The Hebrew word to repent, nicham,
          signifies consolari, to take comfort.' Your sorrow shall be turned
          into joy.' John 16: 20. Christ turns the water of tears into wine.
          David, who was the great mourner in Israel, was the sweet singer. And
          the joy which a true penitent finds, is a pre-libation and foretaste
          of the joy of paradise. The wicked man's joy turns to sadness: the
          penitent's sadness turns to joy. Though repentance seems at first to
          be thorny and bitter, yet of this thorn a Christian gathers grapes.
          All which considerations may open a vein of godly sorrow in our souls,
          that we may both weep for sin, and turn from it. If ever God restores
          comfort, it is to his mourners. Isa 57: 18. When we have wept, let us
          look up to Christ's blood for pardon. Say, as that holy man, lava,
          Domine, lacrimas meas: Lord, wash my tears in thy blood.' We drop sin
          with our tears, and need Christ's blood to wash them. This repentance
          must be not for a few days only, like the mourning for a friend, which
          is soon over, but it must be the work of our lives; the issue of godly
          sorrow must not be stopped till death. After sin is pardoned, we must
          repent. We run afresh upon the score, we sin daily, therefore must
          repent daily.' Some shed a few tears for sin; and when, like the
          widow's oil, they have run awhile, they cease. Many, if the plaister
          of repentance begin to smart a little, pluck it off; whereas the
          plaister of repentance must still lie on, and not be plucked off till
          death, when, as all other tears, so these of godly sorrow shall be
          wiped away.
        </p>
        <p>What shall we do to obtain a penitential frame of heart?</p>
        <p>
          Seek to God for it. It is his promise to give a heart of flesh' (Ezek
          36:26); and to pour on us a spirit of mourning. Zech 12: 10. Beg God's
          Holy Spirit.' He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.' Psa
          147: 18. When the wind of God's Spirit blows upon us, then the waters
          of repentant tears will flow from us.<br />
