        <p>But I give myself unto prayer.' Psa 109: 4.</p>
        <p>
          I shall not here expatiate upon prayer, as it will be considered more
          fully in the Lord's prayer. It is one thing to pray, and another thing
          to be given to prayer: he who prays frequently, is said to be given to
          prayer; as he who often distributes alms, is said to be given to
          charity. Prayer is a glorious ordinance, it is the soul's trading with
          heaven. God comes down to us by his Spirit, and we go up to him by
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>What is prayer?</p>
        <p>
          It is an offering up of our desires to God for things agreeable to his
          will, in the name of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer is offering up our desires;' and therefore called making known
          our requests. Phil 4: 6. In prayer we come as humble petitioners,
          begging to have our suit granted. It is offering up our desires to
          God.' Prayer is not to be made to any but God. The Papists pray to
          saints and angels, who know not our grievances. Abraham be ignorant of
          us.' Isa 63: 16. All angel-worship is forbidden. Col 2: 18, 19. We
          must not pray to any but whom we may believe in. How shall they call
          on him in whom they have not believed?' Rom 10: 14. We cannot believe
          in an angel, therefore we must not pray to him.
        </p>
        <p>Why must prayer be made to God only?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Because he only hears prayer. Oh thou that hearest prayer.' Psa
          65: 2. Hereby God is known to be the true God, in that he hears
          prayer. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou
          art the Lord God.' 1 Kings 18: 37.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Because God only can help. We may look to second causes, and cry,
          as the woman did, Help, my lord, O king.' And he said, If the Lord do
          not help thee, whence shall I help thee?' 2 Kings 6: 26, 27. If we are
          in outward distress, God must send from heaven and save; if we are in
          inward agonies, he only can pour in the oil of joy; therefore prayer
          is to be made to him only.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to pray for things agreeable to his will.' When we pray for
          outward things, for riches or children, perhaps God sees these things
          not to be good for us; and our prayers should comport with his will.
          We may pray absolutely for grace; For this is the will of God, even
          your sanctification.' 1 Thess 4: 3. There must be no strange incense
          offered. Exod 30: 9. When we pray for things which are not agreeable
          to God's will, it is offering strange incense.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to pray in the name of Christ.' To pray in the name of Christ,
          is not only to mention Christ's name in prayer, but to pray in the
          hope and confidence of his merits. Samuel took a sucking lamb and
          offered it,' &amp;c.1 Sam 7: 9. We must carry the lamb Christ in the
          arms of our faith, and so shall we prevail in prayer. When Uzziah
          would offer incense without a priest, God was angry, and struck him
          with leprosy.2 Chron 26: 16. When we do not pray in Christ's name, in
          the hope of his mediation, we offer up incense without a priest; and
          what can we expect but to meet with rebukes, and to have God answer us
          by terrible things?
        </p>
        <p>What are the several parts of prayer?</p>
        <p>
          (1) There is the confessors part, which is the acknowledgement of sin.
          (2) The supplicatory part, when we either deprecate and pray against
          some evil, or request the obtaining of some good. (3) The
          congratulatory part, when we give thanks for mercies received, which
          is the most excellent part of prayer. In petition, we act like men; in
          giving thanks, we act like angels.
        </p>
        <p>What are the several sorts of prayer?</p>
        <p>
          (1) There is mental prayer, in the mind.1 Sam 1: 13. (2) Vocal. Psa
          77: 1. (3) Ejaculatory, which is a sudden and short elevation of the
          heart to God. So I prayed to the God of heaven.' Neh 2: 4. (4)
          Inspired prayer, when we pray for those things which God puts into our
          heart. The Spirit helps us with sighs and groans. Rom 8: 26. Both the
          expressions of the tongue, and the impressions of the heart, so far as
          they are right, are from the Spirit. (5) Prescribed prayer. Our
          Saviour has set us a pattern of prayer. God prescribed a set form of
          blessing for the priests. Numb 6: 23. (6) Public prayer, when we pray
          in the audience of others. Prayer is more powerful when many join and
          unite their forces. Vis unita fortior [A united force is stronger].
          Matt 18: 19. (7) Private prayer; when we pray by ourselves. Enter into
          thy closet.' Matt 6: 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          That prayer is most likely to prevail with God which is rightly
          qualified. That is a good medicine which has the right ingredients;
          and that prayer is good, and most likely to prevail with God, which
          has these seven ingredients in it: --
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be mixed with faith. But let him ask in faith.' James 1: 6.
          Believe that God hears, and will in due time grant, believe his love
          and truth; believe that he is love, and therefore will not deny you;
          believe that he is truth, and therefore will not deny himself. Faith
          sets prayer to work. Faith is to prayer what the feather is to the
          arrow; it feathers the arrow of prayer, and makes it fly swifter, and
          pierce the throne of grace. The prayer that is faithless is fruitless.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be a melting prayer. The sacrifices of God are a broken
          spirit.' Psa 51: 17. The incense was to be beaten to typify the
          breaking of the heart in prayer. Oh! says a Christian, I cannot pray
          with such gifts and elocution as others; as Moses said, I am not
          eloquent;' but can't thou weep? Does thy heart melt in prayer? Weeping
          prayer prevails. Tears drop as pearls from the eye. Jacob wept and
          made supplication; and had power over the angel.' Hosea 12: 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer must be fired with zeal and fervency. Effectual fervent prayer
          availeth much.' James 5: 16. Cold prayer, like cold suitors, never
          speed. Prayer without fervency, is like a sacrifice without a fire.
          Prayer is called a pouring out of the soul,' to signify vehemence.1
          Sam 1: 15. Formality starves prayer. Prayer is compared to incense.
          Let my prayer be set forth as incense.' Psa 141: 2. Hot coals were to
          be put to the incense, to make it odoriferous and fragrant; so
          fervency of affection is like coals to the incense; it makes prayer
          ascend as a sweet perfume. Christ prayed with strong cries. Heb 5: 7.
          Clamor iste penetrat nubes [Such a cry pierces the clouds]. Luther.
          Fervent prayer, like a powder engine set against heaven's gates, makes
          them fly open. To cause holy fervour and ardour of soul in prayer,
          consider, (1) Prayer without fervency is no prayer; it is speaking,
          not praying. Lifeless prayer is no more prayer than the picture of a
          man is a man. One may say as Pharaoh, I have dreamed a dream.' Gen 41:
          15. It is dreaming, not praying. Life and fervency baptise a duty, and
          give it a name. (2) Consider in what need we stand of those things
          which we ask in prayer. We come to ask the favour of God; and if we
          have not his love all we enjoy is cursed to us. We pray that our souls
          may be washed in Christ's blood; if he wash us not we have no part in
          him. John 13: 8. When will we be in earnest, if not when we are
          praying for the life of our souls? (3) It is only fervent prayer that
          has the promise of mercy affixed to it. Ye shall find me, when ye
          shall search for me with all your heart.' Jer 29: 13. It is dead
          praying without a promise; and the promise is made only to ardency.
          The a tiles among the Romans, had their doors always standing open,
          that all who had petitions might have free access to them; so God's
          heart is ever open to fervent prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer must be sincere. Sincerity is the silver thread which must run
          through the whole duties of religion. Sincerity in prayer is when we
          have gracious holy ends; when our prayer is not so much for temporal
          mercies as for spiritual. We send out prayer as our merchant ship,
          that we may have large returns of spiritual blessings. Our aim in it
          is, that our hearts may be more holy, that we may have more communion
          with God and that we may increase our stock of grace. The prayer which
          wants a good aim, wants a good issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prayer that will prevail with God must have a fixedness of mind.
          My heart is fixed, O God.' Psa 57: 7. Since the fall the mind is like
          quicksilver, which will not fix; it has principium motus, but non
          quietus [a principle of restlessness, not of peace]. The thoughts will
          be roving and dancing up and down in prayer, just as if a man who is
          travelling to a certain place should run out of the road, and wander
          he knows not whither. In prayer we are travelling to the throne of
          grace, but how often do we, by vain cogitations, turn out of the road!
          This is rather wandering than praying.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall we cure these vain impertinent thoughts, which distract us
          in prayer, and, we fear, hinder its acceptance?
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Be very apprehensive in prayer of the infiniteness of God's
          majesty and purity. His eye is upon us in prayer, and we may say as
          David, Thou tellest my wanderings.' Psa 56: 8. The thoughts of this
          would make us hoc agere, mind the duty we are about. If a man were to
          deliver a petition to an earthly prince, would he at the same time be
          playing with a feather? Set yourselves, when you pray, as in God's
          presence. Could you but look through the keyhole of heaven, and see
          how devout and intent the angels are in their worshipping God, surely
          you would be ready to blush at your vain thoughts and vile
          impertinences in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If you would keep your mind fixed in prayer, keep your eye fixed.
          Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.'
          Psa 123: 1. Much vanity comes in at the eye. When the eye wanders in
          prayer, the heart wanders. To think to keep the heart fixed in prayer,
          and yet let the eye gaze, is as if one should think to keep his house
          safe, and yet let the windows be open.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If you would have your thoughts fixed in prayer, get more love to
          God. Love is a great fixer of the thoughts. He who is in love cannot
          keep his thoughts off the object. He who loves the world has his
          thoughts upon the world. Did we love God more, our minds would be more
          intent upon him in prayer. Were there more delight in duty, there
          would be less distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Implore the help of God's Spirit to fix your minds, and make them
          intent and serious in prayer. The ship without a pilot rather floats
          than sails. That our thoughts do not float up and down in prayer, we
          need the blessed Spirit to be our pilot to steer us. Only God's Spirit
          can bound the thoughts. A shaking hand may as well write a line
          steadily, as we can keep our hearts fixed in prayer without the Spirit
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Make holy thoughts familiar to you in your ordinary course of
          life. David was often musing on God. When I am awake, I am still with
          thee.' Psa 139: 18. He who gives himself liberty to have vain thoughts
          out of prayer, will scarcely have other thoughts in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) If you would keep your mind fixed on God, watch your hearts, not
          only after prayer, but in prayer. The heart will be apt to give you
          the slip, and have a thousand vagaries in prayer. We read of angels
          ascending and descending on Jacob's ladder; so in prayer you shall
          find your hearts ascending to heaven, and in a moment descending upon
          earthly objects. O Christians, watch your hearts in prayer. What a
          shame is it to think, that when we are speaking to God our hearts
          should be in the fields, or in our counting-houses, or one way or
          other, running upon the devil's errand!
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) Labour for larger degrees of grace. The more ballast the ship has
          the better it sails; so the more the heart is ballasted with grace,
          the steadier it will sail to heaven in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer that is likely to prevail with God must be argumentative. God
          loves to have us plead with him, and use arguments in prayer. See how
          many arguments Jacob used in prayer. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the
          hand of my brother.' Gen 32: 11. The arguments he used are from God's
          command Thou saidst to me, Return to thy country;' ver 9; as if he had
          said, I did not take this journey of my own head, but by thy
          direction; therefore thou canst not but in honour protect me. And he
          uses another argument. Thou saidst, I will surely do thee good;' ver
          12. Lord, wilt thou go back from thy own promise? Thus he was
          argumentative in prayer; and he got not only a new blessing, but a new
          name. Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a
          prince hast thou power with God, and hast prevailed;' ver 28. God
          loves to be overcome with strength of argument. Thus, when we come to
          God in prayer for grace, let us be argumentative. Lord, thou callest
          thyself the God of all grace; and whither should we go with our
          vessel, but to the fountain? Lord, thy grace may be imparted, yet not
          impaired. Has not Christ purchased grace for poor indigent creatures?
          Every drachm of grace costs a drop of blood. Shall Christ die to
          purchase grace for us, and shall not we have the fruit of his
          purchase? Lord, it is thy delight to milk out the breast of mercy and
          grace, and wilt thou abridge thyself of thy own delight? Thou hast
          promised to give thy Spirit to implant grace; can truth lie? can
          faithfulness deceive? God loves thus to be overcome with arguments in
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prayer that would prevail with God, must be joined with reformation.
          If thou stretch out thy hands toward him; if iniquity be in thy hand,
          put it far away.' Job 11: 13, 14. Sin, lived in, makes the heart hard,
          and God's ear deaf. It is foolish to pray against sin, and then sin
          against prayer. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not
          hear me.' Psa 66: 18. The loadstone loses its virtue when bespread
          with garlic; so does prayer when polluted with sin. The incense of
          prayer must be offered upon the altar of a holy heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you see what is the prayer which is most likely to prevail with
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. It reproves (1) Such as pray not at all. It is made the note
          of a reprobate, that he calls not upon God. Psa 14: 4. Does he think
          to have an alms who never asks it? Do they think to have mercy from
          Cod who never seek it? Then God would befriend them more than he did
          his own Son. Christ offered up prayers with strong cries. Heb 5: 7.
          None of God's children are born dumb. Gal 4: 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It reproves such as have left off prayer, which is a sign that
          they never felt the fruit and comfort of it. He that leaves off prayer
          leaves off to fear God. Thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer
          before God.' Job 15: 4. A man that has left off prayer, is fit for any
          wickedness. When Saul had given over inquiring after God he went to
          the witch of Endor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Be persons given to prayer. I give myself,' says David, to
          prayer.' Pray for pardon and purity. Prayer is the golden key that
          opens heaven. The tree of the promise will not drop its fruit unless
          shaken by the hand of prayer. All the benefits of Christ's redemption
          are handed over to us by prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have prayed a long time for mercy, and have no answer. I am weary of
          crying.' Ps 69: 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) God may hear us when we do not hear from him; as soon as prayer is
          made, God hears it, though he does not presently answer. A friend may
          receive our letter, though he does not presently send us an answer.
          (2) God may delay prayer, yet he will not deny it.
        </p>
        <p>Why does God delay an answer to prayer?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Because he loves to hear the voice of prayer. The prayer of the
          upright is his delight.' Prov 15: 8. You let the musician play a great
          while ere you throw him down money, because you love to hear his
          music. Cant 2: 14.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) God may delay prayer when he will not deny it, that he may humble
          us. He has spoken to us long in his word to leave our sins, but we
          would not hear him; therefore he lets us speak to him in prayer and
          seems not to hear us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) He may delay to answer prayer when he will not deny it, because he
          sees we are not yet fit for the mercy we ask. Perhaps we pray for
          deliverance when we are not fit for it; our scum is not yet boiled
          away. We would have God swift to deliver, and we are slow to repent.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) God may delay to answer prayer, that the mercy we pray for may be
          more prized, and may be sweeter when it comes. The longer the
          merchant's ships stay abroad, the more he rejoices when they come home
          laden with spices and jewels; therefore be not discouraged, but follow
          God with prayer. Though God delays, he will not deny. Prayer vincit
          invincibilem [conquers the invincible], it overcomes the Omnipotent.
          Hos 12: 4. The Syrians tied their god Hercules fast with a golden
          chain, that he should not remove. The Lord was held by Moses' prayer
          as with a golden chain. Let me alone;' why, what did Moses? he only
          prayed. Exod 32: 10. Prayer ushers in mercy. Be thy case never so sad,
