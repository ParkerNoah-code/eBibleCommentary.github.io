      <section>
        <p>
          Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
          thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
          that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself
          to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am o jealous God,
          visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
          and fourth generation of then that hate me; and shewing mercy unto
          thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.' Exod 20:
          4-6.
        </p>
        <p>I. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.</p>
        <p>
          In the first commandment worshipping a false god is forbidden; in
          this, worshipping the true God in a false manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.' This forbids not
          making an image for civil use. Whose is this image and superscription?
          They say unto him, It is Caesar's.' Matt 22: 20, 21. But the
          commandment forbids setting up an image for religious use or worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor the likeness of any thing,' &amp;c. All ideas, portraitures,
          shapes, images of God, whether by effigies or pictures, are here
          forbidden. Take heed lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make the
          similitude of any figure.' Deut 4: 15, 16. God is to be adored in the
          heart, not painted to the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou shalt not bow down to them.' The intent of making images and
          pictures is to worship them. No sooner was Nebuchadnezzar's golden
          image set up, but all the people fell down and worshipped it. Dan 3:
          7. God forbids such prostrating ourselves before an idol. The thing
          prohibited in this commandment is image-worship. To set up an image to
          represent God, is debasing him. If any one should make images of
          snakes or spiders, saying he did it to represent his prince, would not
          the prince take it in disdain? What greater disparagement to the
          infinite God than to represent him by that which is unite; the living
          God, by that which is without life; and the Maker of all by a thing
          which is made?
        </p>
        <p>
          To make a true image of God is impossible. God is a spiritual essence
          and, being a Spirit, he is invisible. John 4: 24. Ye saw no manner of
          similitude on the day that the Lord spake with you out of the midst of
          the fire.' Deut 4: 15. How can any paint the Deity? Can they make an
          image of that which they never saw? Quod invisibile est, pingi non
          potest [There is no depicting the invisible]. Ambrose. Ye saw no
          similitude.' It is impossible to make a picture of the soul, or to
          paint the angels, because they are of a spiritual nature; much less
          can we paint God by an image, who is an infinite, untreated Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>To worship God by an image, is both absurd and unlawful.</p>
        <p>
          (1) It is absurd and irrational; for, the workman is better than the
          work,' He who has builded the house has more honour than the house.'
          Heb 3: 3. If the workman be better than the work, and none bow to the
          workman, how absurd, then, is it to bow to the work of his hands! Is
          it not an absurd thing to bow down to the king's picture, when the
          king himself is present? It is more so to bow down to an image of God,
          when God himself is everywhere present.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It is unlawful to worship God by an image; for it is against the
          homily of the church, which runs thus: The images of God, our Saviour,
          the Virgin Mary, are of all others the most dangerous; therefore the
          greatest care ought to be had that they stand not in temples and
          churches.' So that image-worship is contrary to our own homilies, and
          affronts the authority of the Church of England. Image-worship is
          expressly against the letter of Scripture. Ye shall make no graven
          image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone to bow down unto
          it.' Lev 26: 1. Neither shalt thou set up any image; which the Lord
          thy God hateth.' Deut 16: 22. Confounded be all they that serve graven
          images.' Psa 97: 7. Do we think to please God by doing that which is
          contrary to his mind, and that which he has expressly forbidden?
        </p>
        <p>
          Image worship is against the practice of the saints of old. Josiah,
          that renowned king, destroyed the groves and images.2 Kings 23: 6, 24.
          Constantine abrogated the images set up in temples. The Christians
          destroyed images at Baste, Zurich, and Bohemia. When the Roman
          emperors would have thrust images upon them, they chose rather to die
          than deflower their virgin profession by idolatry; they refused to
          admit any painter or carver into their society, because they would not
          have any carved state or image of God. When Seraphion bowed to an
          idol, the Christians excommunicated him, and delivered him up to
          Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. The Church of Rome is reproved and condemned, which, from the
          Alpha of its religion to the Omega, is wholly idolatrous. Romanists
          make images of God the Father, painting him in their church windows as
          an old man; and an image of Christ on the crucifix; and, because it is
          against the letter of this commandment, they sacrilegiously blot it
          out of their catechism, and divide the tenth commandment into two.
          Image worship must needs be very impious and blasphemous, because it
          is giving the religious worship to the creature which is due to God
          only. It is vain for Papists to say, they give God the worship of the
          heart, and the image only the worship of the body; for the worship of
          the body is due to God, as well as the worship of the heart; and to
          give an outward veneration to an image is to give the adoration to a
          creature which belongs to God only. My glory will I not give to
          another.' Isa 42: 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Papists say they do not worship the image, but only use it as a
          medium through which to worship God. Ne imagini quidem Christi in
          quantum est lignum sculptum, ulla debetur reverentia [Not even to a
          statue of Christ is any reverence owed, since it is only a piece of
          carved wood]. Aquinas.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Where has God bidden them worship him by an effigy or image? Who
          has required this at your hands?' Isa 1: 12. The Papists cannot say so
          much as the devil, Scriptum est: It is written.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The heathen may bring the same argument for their gross idolatry,
          as the Papists do for their image-worship. What heathen has been so
          simple as to think gold or silver, or the figure of an ox or elephant,
          was God? These were emblems and hieroglyphics only to represent him.
          They worshipped an invisible God by such visible things. To worship
          God by an image, God takes as done to the image itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, say the Papists, images are laymen's books, and they are good to
          put them in mind of God. One of the Popish Councils affirmed, that we
          might learn more by an image than by long study of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          What profiteth the graven image, the molten image, and a teacher of
          lies.' Hab 2: 18. Is an image a layman's book? Then see what lessons
          this book teaches. It teaches lies; it represents God in a visible
          shape, who is invisible. For Papists to say they make use of an image
          to put them in mind of God, is as if a woman should say she keeps
          company with another man to put her in mind of her husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          But did not Moses make the image of a brazen serpent? Why, then, may
          not images be set tip?
        </p>
        <p>
          That was done by God's special command. Make thee a brazen serpent.'
          Numb 21: 8. There was also a special use in it, both literal and
          spiritual. What! does the setting up of the image of the brazen
          serpent justify the setting up images in churches? What! because Moses
          made an image by God's appointment, may we set up an image of our own
          devising? Because Moses made an image to heal them that were stung, is
          it lawful to set up images in churches to sting them that are whole?
          Nay, that very brazen serpent which God himself commanded to be set
          up, when Israel looked upon it with too much reverence, and began to
          burn incense to it, Hezekiah defaced, and called it Nehushtan, mere
          brass; and God commended him for so doing.2 Kings 18: 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is not God represented as having hands, and eyes, and cars? Why
          nay we not, then, make an image to represent him, and help our
          devotion?
        </p>
        <p>
          Though God is pleased to stoop to our weak capacities, and set himself
          out in Scripture by eyes, to signify his omniscience, and hands to
          signify his power, yet it is absurd, from such metaphors and
          figurative expressions, to bring an argument for images and pictures;
          for, by that rule, God may be pictured by the sun and the element of
          fire, and by a rock; for he is set forth by these metaphors in
          Scripture; and, sure, the Papists themselves would not like to have
          such images made of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be not lawful to make the image of God the Father, yet may we
          not make an image of Christ, who took upon him the nature of man?
        </p>
        <p>
          No! Epiphanies, seeing an image of Christ hanging in a church, brake
          it in pieces. It is Christ's Godhead, united to his manhood, that
          makes him to be Christ; therefore to picture his manhood, when we
          cannot picture his Godhead, is a sin, because we make him to be but
          half Christ -- we separate what God has joined, we leave out that
          which is the chief thing which makes him to be Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how shall we conceive of God aright, if we may not make any image
          or resemblance of him?
        </p>
        <p>
          We must conceive of God spiritually. (1) In his attributes -- his
          holiness, justice, goodness -- which are the beams by which his divine
          nature shines forth. (2) We must conceive of him as he is in Christ.
          Christ is the Image of the invisible God' as in the wax we see the
          print of the seal. Col 1: 15. Set the eyes of your faith on
          Christ-God-man. He that has seen me, has seen the Father.' John 14: 9.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Take heed of the idolatry of image-worship. Our nature is
          prone to this sin as dry wood to take fire; and, indeed, what need of
          so many words in the commandment: Thou shalt not make any graven
          image, or the likeness of anything in heaven, earth, water,' sun,
          moon, stars, male, female, fish; Thou shalt not bow down to them.' I
          say, what need of so many words, but to show how subject we are to
          this sin of false worship? It concerns us, therefore, to resist this
          sin. Where the tide is apt to run with greater force, there we had
          need to make the banks higher and stronger. The plague of idolatry is
          very infectious. They were mingled among the heathen, and served their
          idols.' Psa 106: 35, 36. It is my advice to you, to avoid all
          occasions of this sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Come not into the company of idolatrous Papists. Dare not to live
          under the same roof with them, or you run into the devil's mouth. John
          the divine would not be in the has where Cerinthus the heretic was.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Go not into their chapels to see their crucifixes, or hear mass.
          As looking on a harlot draws to adultery, so looking on the popish
          gilded picture may draw to idolatry. Some go to see their
          idol-worship. A vagrant who has nothing to lose, cares not to go among
          thieves; so such as have no goodness in them, care not to what
          idolatrous places they come or to what temptations they expose
          themselves; but you who have a treasure of good principles about you,
          take heed the popish priests do not rob you of them, and defile you
          with their images.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Dare not join in marriage with image-worshippers. Though Solomon
          was a man of wisdom, his idolatrous wives drew his heart away from
          God. The people of Israel entered into an oath and curse, that they
          would not give their daughters in marriage to idolaters. Neh 10: 30.
          For a Protestant and Papist to marry, is to be unequally yoked (2 Cor
          6: 14); and there is more danger that the Papist will corrupt the
          Protestant, shall hope that the Protestant will convert the Papist.
          Mingle wine and vinegar, the vinegar will sooner sour the wine, than
          the wine will sweeten the vinegar.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Avoid superstition, which is a bridge that leads over to Rome.
          Superstition is bringing any ceremony, fancy, or innovation into God's
          worship, which he never appointed. It is provoking God, because it
          reflects much upon his honour, as if he were not wise enough to
          appoint the manner of his own worship. He hates all strange fire to be
          offered in his temple. Lev 10: 1. A ceremony may in time lead to a
          crucifix. They who contend for the cross in baptism, why not have the
          oil, salt, and cream as well, the one being as ancient as the other?
          They who are for altar-worship, and will bow to the east, may in time
          bow to the Host. Take heed of all occasions of idolatry, for idolatry
          is devil-worship. Psalm 106: 37. If you search through the whole
          Bible, there is not one sin that God has more followed with plagues
          than idolatry. The Jews have a saying, that in every evil that befalls
          them, there is uncia aurei vituli, an ounce of the golden calf in it.
          Hell is a place for idolaters. For without are idolaters.' Rev 22: 15.
          Senesius calls the devil a rejoicer at idols, because the
          image-worshippers help to fill hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. That you may be preserved from idolatry and image-worship.
          (1) Get good principles, that you may be able to oppose the gainsayer.
          Whence does the popish religion get ground? Not from the goodness of
          their cause, but from the ignorance of their people. (2) Get love to
          God. The wife that loves her husband is safe from the adulterer; and
          the soul that loves Christ is safe from the idolater. (3) Pray that
          God will keep you. Though it is true, there is nothing in an image to
          tempt (for if we pray to an image, it cannot hear, and if we pray to
          God by an image, he will not hear), yet we know not our own hearts, or
          how soon we may be drawn to vanity, if God leaves us. Therefore pray
          that you be not enticed by false worship, or receive the mark of the
          beast in your right hand or forehead. Pray, Hold thou me up, and I
          shall be safe.' Psa 119: 117. Lord, let me neither mistake my way for
          want of light, nor leave the true way for want of courage. (4) Let us
          bless God who has given us the knowledge of his truth, that we have
          tasted the honey of his word, and our eyes are enlightened. Let us
          bless him that he has shown us the pattern of his house, the right
          mode of worship; that he has discovered to us the forgery and
          blasphemy of the Romish religion. Let us pray that God will preserve
          pure ordinances and powerful preaching among us. Idolatry came in at
          first by the want of good preaching. The people began to have golden
          images when they had wooden priests.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I the Lord thy God am a jealous God. The first reason why Israel
          must not worship graven images is, because the Lord is a jealous God.
          The Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.' Exod 34: 14.
          Jealousy is taken, In a good sense, as God is jealous for his people.
          In a bad sense, as he is jealous of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a good sense; as God is jealous for his people. Thus saith the
          Lord, I am jealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion, with a great
          jealousy.' Zech 1: 14. God has a dear affection for his people, they
          are his Hephzibah, or delight. Isa 62: 4. They are the apple of his
          eye, Zech 2: 8, to express how dear they are to him, and how tender he
          is of them, Nihil carius pupilla oculi [Nothing is dearer than the
          apple of the eye]. Drusius. They are his spouse, adorned with jewels
          of grace; they lie near his heart. He is jealous for his spouse,
          therefore he will be avenged on those who wrong her. The Lord shall
          stir up jealousy like a man of war; he shall roar, he shall prevail
          against his enemies.' Isa 42: 13. What is done to the saints, God
          takes as done to himself (2 Kings 19: 22); and the Lord will undo all
          that afflict Zion. I will undo all that afflict thee.' Zeph 3: 19.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jealousy is taken in a bad sense, in which God is jealous of his
          people. It is so taken in this commandment, I the Lord thy God am a
          jealous God.' I am jealous lest you should go after false gods, or
          worship the true God in a false manner; lest you defile your
          virgin-profession by images. God will have his spouse to keep close to
          him, and not go after other lovers. Thou shalt not be for another man'
          Hos 3: 3. He cannot bear a rival. Our conjugal love, a love joined
          with adoration and worship, must be given to God only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. Let us give God no just cause to be jealous. A good wife will
          be so discreet and chaste, as to give her husband no just occasion of
          jealousy. Let us avoid all sin, especially this of idolatry, or
          image-worship. It is heinous, after we have entered into a marriage
          covenant with God, to prostitute ourselves to an image. Idolatry is
          spiritual adultery, and God is a jealous God, he will avenge it.
          Image-worship makes God abhor a people. They moved him to jealousy
          with their graven images. When God heard this, he was wrath, and
          greatly abhorred Israel.' Psa 78: 58, 59. Jealousy is the rage of a
          man.' Prov 6: 34. Image-worship enrages God; it makes God divorce a
          people. Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife.' Hos 2:
          2. Jealousy is cruel as the grave.' Cant 8: 6. As the grave devours
          men's bodies, so God will devour image-worshippers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. If God be a jealous God, let it be remembered by those whose
          friends are popish idolaters, and who are hated by their friends,
          because they are of a different religion, and perhaps their
          maintenance cut off from them. Oh, remember, God is a jealous God;
          better move your parents to hatred, than move God to jealousy! Their
          anger cannot do you so much hurt as God's. If they will not provide
          for you, God will. When my father and my mother forsake me, then the
          Lord will take me up.' Psa 27: 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
          third and fourth generation. Here is the second reason against
          image-worship. There is a twofold visiting. There is God's visiting in
          mercy. God will surely visit you:' that is, he will bring you into the
          land of Canaan, the type of heaven. Gen 50: 25. Thus God has visited
          us with the sunbeams of his favour; he has made us swim in a sea of
          mercy. This is a happy visitation. There is God's visiting in anger.
          Shall I not visit for these things?' that is, God's visiting with the
          rod. Jer 5: 9. What will ye do in the day of visitation?' that is, in
          the day when God shall visit with his judgements. Isa 10: 3. Thus
          God's visiting is taken in this commandment, visiting iniquity,' that
          is, punishing iniquity. Observe here three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          That sin makes God visit. Visiting iniquity.' Sin is the cause why God
          visits with sickness, poverty, &amp;c. If they keep not my
          commandments, then will I visit their transgressions with the rod.'
          Psa 89: 31, 32. Sin twists the cords which pinch us; it creates all
          our troubles, is the gall in our cup, and the gravel in our bread. Sin
          is the Trojan horse, the Phaeton that sets all on fire; it is the womb
          of our sorrows, and the grave of our comfort. God visits for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          One special sin for which God's visits, is idolatry and image-worship.
          Visiting the iniquity of the fathers.' Most of his envenomed arrows
          have been shot among idolaters. Go now unto my place which was in
          Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it.'
          Jer 7: 12. For Israel's idolatry he suffered their army to be routed,
          their priests slain, the ark taken captive, of the returns of which to
          Shiloh we never read any more. Jerusalem was the most famous
          metropolis of the world; there was the temple. Whither the tribes go
          up, the tribes of the Lord.' Psa 122: 4. But for the high places and
          images, that city was besieged and taken by the Chaldean forces.2
          Kings 25: 4. When images were set up in Constantinople, the chief seat
          of the Eastern empire, a city which in the eye of the world was
          impregnable, it was taken by the Turks, and many cruelly massacred.
          The Turks in their triumphs at that time reproached the idolatrous
          Christians, caused an image or crucifix to be carried through the
          streets in contempt, and threw dirt upon it, crying, This is the god
          of the Christians.' Here was God's visitation for their idolatry. God
          has set special marks of his wrath upon idolaters. At a place called
          Epoletium, there perished by an earthquake 350 persons, while they
          were offering sacrifice to idols. Idolatry brought misery upon the
          Eastern churches, and removed the golden candlesticks of Asia. For
          this iniquity God visits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Idolatrous persons are enemies not to their own souls only, but to
          their children. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon their
          children.' As an idolatrous father entails his land of inheritance, so
          he entails God's anger and curse upon his children. A jealous husband,
          finding his wife has stained her fidelity, may justly cast her offend
          her children too, because they are none of his. If the father be a
          traitor to his prince, no wonder if all the children suffer. God may
          visit the iniquity of image-worshippers upon their children.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is it not said, Every man shall die for his own sin; the son shall
          not bear the iniquity of the father?' 2 Chron 25: 4, Ezek 18: 20. How
          then does God say, he will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the
          children?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the son be not damned, yet he may be severely punished for his
          father's sin. God layeth up his iniquity for his children' (Job 21:
          19); that is, God lays up the punishment of his iniquity for his
          children -- the child smarts for the father's sin. Jeroboam thought to
          have established the kingdom by idolatrous worship, but it brought
          ruin upon him, and all his posterity.1 Kings 14: 10. Ahab's idolatry
          wronged his posterity, which lost the kingdom, and were all beheaded.
          They took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons.' 2 Kings 10: 7.
          Here God visited the iniquity of the father upon the children. As a
          son catches an hereditary disease from his father, the stone or gout,
          so he catches misery from him: his father's sin ruins him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. How sad is it to be the child of an idolater! It had been sad
          to have been one of Gehazi's children, who had leprosy entailed upon
          them. The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed
          for ever.' 2 Kings 5: 27. So it is sad to be a child of an idolater,
          or image-worshipper; for his seed are exposed to heavy judgements in
          this life. God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon their
          children.' Methinks I hear God speak, as in Isa 14: 21, Prepare
          slaughter for his children, for the iniquity of their fathers.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. What a privilege it is to be the children of good parents.
          The parents are in covenant with God, and God lays up mercy for their
          posterity. The just man walketh in his integrity, his children are
          blessed after him.' Prov 20: 7. A religious parent does not procure
          wrath, but helps to keep off wrath from his child; he seasons his
          child with religious principles, he prays down a blessing on it; he is
          a loadstone to draw his child to Christ by good counsel and example.
          Oh, what a privilege is it to be born of godly, religious parents!
          Augustine says that his mother Monica travailed with greater care and
          pains for his new birth, than for his natural. Wicked idolaters entail
          misery on their posterity; God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon
          their children;' but religious parents procure a blessing upon their
          children; God reserves mercy for their posterity.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Of them that hate me. Another reason against image-worship is,
          that it is hating God. The Papists, who worship God by an image, hate
          God. Image-worship is a pretended love to God, but God interprets it
          as hating him. Quae diligit alienum odit sponsum, she that loves
          another man, hates her own husband.' An image-lover is a God hater.
          Idolaters are said to go a whoring from God. Exod 34: 15. How can they
          love God? I shall show that image-worshippers hate God, whatever love
          they pretend.
        </p>
        <p>
          They who go contrary to his express will hate him. He says, you shall
          not set up any statue, image, nor picture, to represent me; these
          things I hate. Neither shalt thou set up any image; which the Lord thy
          God hateth.' Deut 16: 22. Yet the idolater sets up images, and
          worships them. This God looks upon as hating him. How does the child
          love his father that does all it can to cross him?
        </p>
        <p>
          They who turned Jephthah out of doors hated him, therefore they
          laboured to shut him out of his father's house. Judges 11: 7. The
          idolater shuts the truth out of doors; he blots out the second
          commandment; he makes an image of the invisible God; he brings a lie
          into God's worship; which are clear proofs that he hates God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though idolaters love the false image of God in a picture, they hate
          his true image in a believer. They pretend to honour Christ in a
          crucifix, and yet persecute him in his members. Such hate God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. This confutes those who plead for image-worshippers. They are
          very devout people; they adore images; they set up the crucifix; kiss
          it; light candles to it; therefore they love God. Nay, but who shall
          be judge of their love? God says they hate him, and give religious
          adoration to a creature. They hate God, and God hates them; and they
          shall never live with God whom he hates; he will never lay such vipers
          in his bosom. Heaven is kept as paradise, with a flaming sword, that
          they shall not enter in. He repayeth them that hate him to their
          face.' Deut.7: 10. He will shoot all his deadly arrows among
          idolaters. All the plagues and curses in the book of God shall befall
          the idolater. The Lord repays him that hates him to his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Let it exhort all to flee from Romish idolatry. Let us not be
          among God-haters. Little children, keep yourselves from idols.' 1 John
          5: 21. As you would keep your bodies from adultery, keep your souls
          from idolatry. Take heed of images, they are images of jealousy to
          provoke God to anger; they are damnable. You may perish by false
          devotions as much as by real scandal; by image-worship, as by
          drunkenness and whoredom. A man may die by poison as much as a pistol.
          We may go to hell by drinking poison in the Romish cup of fornication,
          as much as by being pistoled with gross and scandalous sins. To
          conclude, God is a jealous God,' who will admit of no co-rival; He
          will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon their children;' he will
          entail a plague upon the posterity of idolaters. He interprets
          idolaters to be such as hate him. He that is an image-lover is a
          God-hater. Therefore keep yourself pure from Romish idolatry; if you
          love your souls, keep yourselves from idols.
        </p>
        <p>V. Showing mercy unto thousands.</p>
        <p>
          Another argument against image-worship, is that God is merciful to
          those who do not provoke him with their images, and will entail mercy
          upon their posterity. Shewing mercy unto thousands.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The golden sceptre of God's mercy is here displayed, shewing mercy to
          thousands.' The heathen thought they praised Jupiter enough when they
          called him good and great. Both excellencies of majesty and mercy meet
          in God. Mercy is an innate propensity in God to do good to distressed
          sinners. God showing mercy, makes his Godhead appear full of glory.
          When Moses said to God, I beseech thee, show me thy glory;' I will,'
          said God, show mercy.' Exod 33: 19. His mercy is his glory. Mercy is
          the name by which he will be known. The Lord passed by, and
          proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious.' Exod 34:
          6. Mercy proceeds primarily, and originally from God. He is called the
          Father of mercies' (2 Cor 1: 3), because he begets all the mercies
          which are in the creature. Our mercies compared with his are scarcely
          so much as a drop to the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>What are the properties of God's mercy?</p>
        <p>
          (1) It is free and spontaneous. To set up merit is to destroy mercy.
          Nothing can deserve mercy or force it; we cannot deserve it nor force
          it, because of our enmity. We may force God to punish us, but not to
          love us. I will love them freely.' Hos 14: 4. Every link in the golden
          chain of salvation is wrought and interwoven with free grace. Election
          is free. He has chosen us in him according to the good pleasure of his
          will.' Eph 1: 4. Justification is free. Being justified freely by his
          grace.' Rom 3: 24. Say not I am unworthy; for mercy is free. If God
          should show mercy only to such as deserve it, he must show mercy to
          none.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The mercy which God shows is powerful. How powerful is that mercy
          which softens a heart of stone! Mercy changed Mary Magdalen's heart,
          out of whom seven devils were cast: she who was an inflexible adamant
          was made a weeping penitent. God's mercy works sweetly, yet
          irresistibly; it allures, yet conquers. The law may terrify, but mercy
          mollifies. Of what sovereign power and efficacy is that mercy which
          subdues the pride and enmity of the heart, and beats off those chains
          of sin in which the soul is held.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The mercy which God shows is superabundant. Abundant in goodness
          and truth, keeping mercy for thousands.' Exod 34: 6. God visits
          iniquity to the third and fourth generation' only, but he shows mercy
          to a thousand generations. Exod 20: 5, 6. The Lord has treasures of
          mercy in store, and therefore is said to be plenteous in mercy' (Psa
          86: 5), and rich in mercy' (Eph 2: 4). The vial of God's wrath drops
          only, but the fountain of his mercy runs. The sun is not so full of
          light as God is of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has mercy of all dimensions. He has depth of mercy, it reaches as
          low as sinners; and height of mercy, it reaches above the clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has mercies for all seasons; mercies for the night, he gives
          sleep; nay, sometimes he gives a song in the night. Psa 42: 8. He has
          also mercies for the morning. His compassions are new every morning.'
          Lam 3: 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has mercies for all sorts. Mercies for the poor: He raiseth up the
          poor out of the dust.' 1 Sam 2: 8. Mercies for the prisoner: he
          despiseth not his prisoners.' Psa 69: 33. Mercies for the dejected: In
          a little wrath I hid my face from thee but with everlasting kindness
          will I have mercy on thee.' Isa 54: 8. He has old mercies: Thy mercies
          have been ever of old.' Psa 25: 6. New mercies: He has put a new song
          in my mouth.' Psa 40: 3. Every time we draw our breath we suck in
          mercy. God has mercies under heaven, and those we taste; and mercies
          in heaven, and those we hope for. Thus his mercies are superabundant.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The mercy of God is abiding. The mercy of the Lord is from
          everlasting to everlasting.' Psa 103: 17. God's anger to his children
          lasts but a while (Psa 103: 9), but his mercy lasts for ever. His
          mercy is not like the widow's oil, which ran awhile, and then ceased
          (2 Kings 4: 6), but overflowing and everflowing. As his mercy is
          without bounds, so is it without end. His mercy endureth for ever.'
          Psa 136. God never cuts off the entail of mercy from the elect.
        </p>
        <p>In how many ways is God said to show mercy?</p>
        <p>
          (1) We are all living monuments of his mercy. He shows mercy to us in
          daily supplying us. He supplies us with health. Health is the sauce
          which makes life sweeter. How would they prize this mercy who are
          chained to a sick-bed! God supplies us with provisions. God which fed
          me all my life long.' Gen 48: 15. Mercy spreads our tables, and carves
          for us every bit of bread we cat; we never drink but in the golden cup
          of mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) God shows mercy in lengthening out our gospel-liberties.1 Cor 16:
          9. There are many adversaries; many would stop the waters of the
          sanctuary that that they should not run. We enjoy the sweet seasons of
          grace, we hear joyful sounds, we see the goings of God in his
          sanctuary, we enjoy Sabbath after Sabbath; the manna of the word falls
          about our tents, when in other parts of the land there is no manna.
          God shows mercy to us in continuing our forfeited privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) He shows mercy in preventing many evils from invading us. Thou, O
          Lord, art a shield for me.' Psa 3: 3. God has restrained the wrath of
          men, and been a screen between us and danger; when the destroying
          angel has been abroad, and shed his deadly arrow of pestilence, he has
          kept off the arrow that it has not come near us.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) He shows mercy in delivering us. And I was delivered out of the
          mouth of the lion' (viz., Nero).2 Tim 4: 17. He has restored us from
          the grave. May we not write the writing of Hezekiah, when he had been
          sick, and was recovered of his sickness?' Isa 38: 9. When we thought
          the sun of our life was setting God has made it return to its former
          brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (S) He shows mercy in restraining us from sin. Lusts within are worse
          than lions without. The greatest sign of God's anger is to give men up
          to their sins. So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust.' Psa 81:
          12. While they sin themselves to hell, God has laid the bridle of
          restraining grace upon us. As he said to Abimelech, I withheld thee
          from sinning against me.' Gen 20: 6. So he has withheld us from those
          sins which might have made us a prey to Satan, and a terror to
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) God shows mercy in guiding and directing us. Is it not a mercy for
          one that is out of the way to have a guide? There is a providential
          guidance. God guides our affairs for us; chalks out the way he would
          have us to walk in. He resolves our doubts, unties our knots, and
          appoints the bounds of our habitation. Acts 17: 26. A spiritual
          guidance. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel.' Psa 73: 24. As Israel
          had a pillar of fire to go before them, so God guides us with the
          oracles of his word, and the conduct of his Spirit. He guides our
          heads to keep us from error; and he guides our feet to keep us from
          scandal. Oh, what mercy is it to have God to be our guide and pilot!
          For thy name's sake, lead me and guide me.' Psa 31: 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) God shows mercy in correcting us. He is angry in love; he smites
          that he may save. His rod is not a rod of iron to break us, but a
          fatherly rod to humble us. He, for our profit, that we might be
          partakers of his holiness.' Heb 12: l0. Either he will mortify some
          corruption, or exercise some grace. Is there not mercy in this? Every
          cross, to a child of God, is like Paul's cross wind, which, though it
          broke the ship, it brought Paul to shore upon the broken pieces. Acts
          27: 44.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) God shows mercy in pardoning us, Who is a God like unto thee, that
          pardoneth iniquity?' Mic 7: 18. It is mercy to feed us, rich mercy to
          pardon us. This mercy is spun out of the bowels of the free grace, and
          is enough to make a sick man well. The inhabitant shall not say, I am
          sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.'
          Isa 33: 24. Pardon of sin is a mercy of the first magnitude. God seals
          the sinner's pardon with a kiss. This made David put on his best
          clothes, and anoint himself. His child was newly dead, and God had
          told him the sword should not depart from his house, yet he anoints
          himself. The reason was that God had sent him pardon by the prophet
          Nathan. The Lord has put away thy sin.' 2 Sam 12: 13. Pardon is the
          only fit remedy for a troubled conscience. What can give ease to a
          wounded spirit but pardoning mercy? Offer him the honours and pleasure
          of the world. It is as if flowers and music were brought to one that
          is condemned.
        </p>
        <p>How may I know that my sins are pardoned?</p>
        <p>
          Where God removes the guilt, he breaks the power of sin. He will have
          compassion: he will subdue our iniquities.' Mic 7: 19. With pardoning
          love God gives subduing grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          (9) God shows his mercy in sanctifying us. I am the Lord which
          sanctify you.' Lev 20: 8. This is the partaking of the divine nature.2
          Pet 1: 4. God's Spirit is a spirit of consecration; though it sanctify
          us but in part, yet it is in every part.1 Thess 5: 23. It is such a
          mercy that God cannot give it in anger. If we are sanctified, we are
          elected. God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification.' 2
          Thess 2: 13. This prepares for happiness, as the seed prepares for
          harvest. When the virgins had been anointed and perfumed, they were to
          stand before the king (Esth 2: 12); SO, when we have had the anointing
          of God, we shall stand before the King of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          (10) God shows mercy in hearing our prayers. Have mercy upon me, and
          hear my prayer.' Psa 4: 1. Is it not a favour, when a man puts up a
          petition to the king, to have it granted? So when we pray for pardon,
          adoption, and the sense of God's love, it is a signal mercy to have a
          gracious answer. God may delay an answer, and yet not deny. You do not
          throw a musician money at once, because you love to hear his music.
          God loves the music of prayer, but does not always let us hear from
          him at once; but in due season gives an answer of peace. Blessed be
          God, which has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.' Psa
          66: 20. If God does not turn away our prayer, he does not turn away
          his mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (11) God shows mercy in saving us. According to his mercy he saved
          us.' Titus 3: 5. This is the top-stone of mercy, and it is laid in
          heaven. Here mercy displays itself in all its orient colours. Mercy is
          mercy indeed, when God perfectly refines us from all the lees and
          dregs of corruption; when our bodies are made like Christ's glorious
          body, and our souls like the angels. Saving mercy is crowning mercy.
          It is not merely to be freed from hell, but enthroned in a kingdom. In
          this life we desire God, rather than enjoy him; but what rich mercy
          will it be to be fully possessed of him, to see his smiling face, and
          to lay us in his bosom! This will fill us with joy unspeakable and
          full of glory.' 1 Peter 1: 8. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with
          thy likeness.' Psa 17: 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. Let us not despair. What an encouragement we have here to
          serve God. He shows mercy to thousands. Who would not be willing to
          serve a prince who is given to mercy and clemency? God is represented
          with a rainbow round about him, as an emblem of his mercy. Rev 4: 3.
          Acts of severity are forced from God; judgement is his strange work.
          Isa 28: 21. The disciples, who are not said to wonder at the other
          miracles of Christ, did wonder when the fig-tree was cursed and
          withered, because it was not his manner to put forth acts of severity.
          God is said to delight in mercy. Mic 7: 18. Justice is God's left
          hand: mercy is his right hand. He uses his right hand most; he is more
          used to mercy than to justice. Pronior est Deus ad parcendum quam ad
          puniendum [God is more inclined to mercy than to punishment]. God is
          said to be slow to anger (Psa 103: 8), but ready to forgive. Psa 86:
          5. This may encourage us to serve him. What argument will prevail, if
          mercy will not? Were God all justice, it might frighten us from him,
          but his mercy is a loadstone to draw us to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Hope in God's mercies. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that
          fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.' Psa 147: 11. He counts it
          his glory to scatter pardons among men.
        </p>
        <p>But I have been a great sinner and sure there is no mercy for me!</p>
        <p>
          Not if thou goest on in sin, and art so resolved; but, if thou wilt
          break off thy sins, the golden sceptre of mercy shall be held forth to
          thee. Let the wicked forsake his way, and let him return unto the
          Lord, and he will have mercy upon him.' Isa 55: 7. Christ's blood is a
          fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness.' Zech 13: 1. Mercy more
          overflows in God, than sin in us. His mercy can drown great sins, as
          the sea covers great rocks. Some of the Jews who had their hands
          imbrued in Christ's blood, were saved by that blood. God loves to
          magnify his goodness, to display the trophies of free grace, and to
          set up his mercy in spite of sin. Therefore, hope in his mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. Labour to know that God's mercy is for you. He is the God
          of my mercy.' Psa.59: 17. A man who was being drowned, seeing a
          rainbow, said, What am I the better, though God will not drown the
          world, if I am drowned?' So, what are we the better, though God is
          merciful, if we perish? Let us labour to know God's special mercy is
          for us.
        </p>
        <p>How shall we know it belongs to us?</p>
        <p>
          (1) If we put a high value and estimate upon it. He will not throw
          away his mercy on them that slight it. We prize health, but we prize
          adopting mercy more. This is the diamond ring; it outshines all other
          comforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If we fear God, if we have a reverend awe upon us, if we tremble
          at sin, and flee from it, as Moses did from his rod turned into a
          serpent. His mercy is on them that fear him.' Luke 1: 50.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If we take sanctuary in God's mercy, we trust in it as a man saved
          by catching hold of a cable. God's mercy to us is a cable let down
          from heaven. By taking fast hold of this by faith, we are saved. I
          trust in the mercy of God for ever.' Psa 52: 8. As a man trusts his
          life and goods in a garrison, so we trust our souls in God's mercy.
        </p>
        <p>How shall we get a share in God's special mercy?</p>
        <p>
          (1) If we would have mercy, it must be through Christ. Out of Christ
          no mercy is to be had. We read in the old law, that none might come
          unto the holy of holies, where the mercy-seat stood, but the
          high-priest: to signify that we have nothing to do with mercy but
          through Christ our High-priest; that the high-priest might not come
          near the mercy-seat without blood, to show that we have no right to
          mercy, but through the expiatory sacrifice of Christ's blood, Lev 16:
          14; that the high-priest might not, upon pain of death, come near the
          mercy-seat without incense, Lev 16: 13, to show that there is no mercy
          from God without the incense of Christ's intercession. If we would
          have mercy, we must get a part in Christ. Mercy swims to us through
          Christ's blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) If we would have mercy, we must pray for it. Show us thy mercy, O
          Lord, and grant us thy salvation.' Psa 85: 7. Turn thee unto me, and
          have mercy upon me.' Psa 25: 16. Lord, put me not off with common
          mercy; give me not only mercy to feed and clothe me, but mercy to
          pardon me; not only sparing mercy, but saving mercy. Lord, give me the
          cream of thy mercies; let me have mercy and loving kindness. Who
          crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies.' Psa 103: 4. Be
          earnest suitors for mercy; let your wants quicken your importunity. We
          pray most fervently when we pray most feelingly.
        </p>
        <p>VI. Of them that love me.</p>
        <p>
          God's mercy is for them that love him. Love is a grace that shines and
          sparkles in his eye, as the precious stone upon Aaron's breastplate.
          Love is a holy expansion or enlargement of soul, by which it is
          carried with delight after God, as the chief good. Aquinas defines
          love -- Complacentia amantis in amato; a complacent delight in God, as
          our treasure. Love is the soul of religion; it is a momentous grace.
          If we had knowledge as the angels, or faith of miracles, yet without
          love it would profit nothing.1 Cor 13: 2. Love is the first and great
          commandment.' Matt.22: 38. It is so, because, if it be wanting, there
          can be no religion in the heart; there can be no faith, for faith
          works by love. Gal 5: 6. All else is but pageantry, or a devout
          compliment. It meliorates and sweetens all the duties of religion, it
          makes them savoury meat, without which God cares not to taste them. It
          is the first and great commandment, in respect of the excellence of
          this grace. Love is the queen of graces; it outshines all others, as
          the sun the lesser planets. In some respects it is more excellent than
          faith; though in one sense faith is more excellent, virtute unionis,
          as it unites us to Christ. It puts upon us the embroidered robe of
          Christ's righteousness, which is brighter than any the angels wear. In
          another sense it is more excellent, respectu durationis, in respect of
          the continuance of it: it is the most durable grace; as faith and hope
          will shortly cease, but love will remain. When all other graces, like
          Rachel, shall die in travail, love shall revive. The other graces are
          in the nature of a lease, for the term of life only; but love is a
          freehold that continues for ever. Thus love carries away the garland
          from all other graces, it is the most long-lived grace, it is a bud of
          eternity. This grace alone will accompany us in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>How must our love to God be characterised?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Love to God must be pure and genuine. He must be loved chiefly for
          himself; which the schoolmen call amor amicitiae. We must love God,
          not only for his benefits, but for those intrinsic excellencies with
          which he is crowned. We must love God not only for the good which
          flows from him, but for the good which is in him. True love is not
          mercenary, he who is deeply in love with God, needs not be hired with
          rewards, he cannot but love God for the beauty of his holiness; though
          it is not unlawful to look for benefits. Moses had an eye to the
          recompense of reward (Heb 11: 26); but we must not love God for his
          benefits only, for then it is not love of God, but self-love.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Love to God must be with all the heart. Thou shalt love the Lord
          thy God with all thy heart.' Mark 12: 30. We must not love God a
          little, give him a drop or two of our love; but the main stream must
          flow to him. The mind must think of God, the will choose him, the
          affections pant after him. The true mother would not have the child
          divided, nor will God have the heart divided. We must love him with
          our whole heart. Though we may love the creature, yet it must be a
          subordinate love. Love to God must be highest, as oil swims above the
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Love to God must be flaming. To love coldly is the same as not to
          love. The spouse is said to be amore perculsa, sick of love.' Cant 2:
          5. The seraphim are so called from their burning love. Love turns
          saints into seraphim; it makes them burn in holy love to God. Many
          waters cannot quench this love.
        </p>
        <p>How may we know whether we love God?</p>
        <p>
          (1) He who loves God desires his presence. Lovers cannot be long
          asunder, they soon have their fainting fits, for want of a sight of
          the object of their love. A soul deeply in love with God desires the
          enjoyment of him in his ordinances, in word, prayer, and sacraments.
          David was ready to faint away and die when he had not a sight of God.
          My soul fainteth for God.' Psa 84: 2. Such as care not for ordinances,
          but say, When will the Sabbath be over? plainly discover want of love
          to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) He who loves God, does not love sin. Ye that love the Lord, hate
          evil.' Psa 97: 10. The love of God, and the love of sin, can no more
          mix together than iron and clay. Every sin loved, strikes at the being
          of God; but he who loves God, has an antipathy against sin. He who
          would part two lovers is a hateful person. God and the believing soul
          are two lovers; sin parts between them, therefore the soul is
          implacably set against it. By this try your love to God. How could
          Delilah say she loved Samson, when she entertained correspondence with
          the Philistine, who were his mortal enemies? How can he say he loves
          God who loves sin, which is God's enemy?
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) He who loves God is not much in love with anything else. His love
          is very cool to worldly things. His love to God moves swiftly, as the
          sun in the firmament; to the world it moves slowly, as the sun on the
          dial. The love of the world eats out the heart of religion; it chokes
          good affections, as earth puts out the fire. The world was a dead
          thing to Paul. The world is crucified unto me and I to the world.' Gal
          6: 14. In Paul we may see both the picture and pattern of a mortified
          man. He that loves God, uses the world but chooses God. The world is
          his pension, but God is his portion. Psa 119: 57. The world engages
          him, but God delights and satisfies him. He says as David, God my
          exceeding joy,' the gladness or cream of my joy. Psa 43: 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) He who loves God cannot live without him. Things we love we cannot
          be without. A man can do without music or flowers, but not food; so a
          soul deeply in love with God looks upon himself as undone without him.
          Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like them that go down into the
          pit.' Psa 143: 7. He says as Job, I went mourning without the sun;'
          chap.30: 28. I have starlight, I want the Sun of Righteousness; I
          enjoy not the sweet presence of my God. Is God our chief good, and we
          cannot live without him? Alas! how do they show they have no love to
          God who can do well enough without him! Let them have but corn and
          oil, and you shall never hear them complain of the want of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) He who loves God will be at any pains to get him. What pains the
          merchant takes, what hazards he runs, to have a rich return from the
          Indies! Extremos currit mercator ad Indos [The merchant races to the
          farthest Indies]. Jacob loved Rachel, and he could endure the heat by
          day, and the frost by night, that he might enjoy her. A soul that
          loves God will take any pains for the fruition of him. My soul
          followeth hard after thee.' Psa 63: 8. Love is pondus animae [the
          pendulum of the soul]. Augustine. It is as the weight which sets the
          clock going. It is much in prayer, weeping, fasting; it strives as in
          agony, that he may obtain him whom his soul loves. Plutarch reports of
          the Gauls, an ancient people of France, that after they had tasted the
          sweet wine of Italy, they never rested till they had arrived at that
          country. He who is in love with God, never rests till he has a part in
          him. I will seek him whom my soul loveth.' Cant 3: 2. How can they say
          they love God, who are not industrious in the use of means to obtain
          him? A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom.' Prov 19: 24. He is
          not in agony, but lethargy. If Christ and salvation would drop as a
          ripe fig into his mouth, he would be content to have them; but he is
          loath to put himself to too much trouble. Does he love his friend, who
          will not undertake a journey to see him?
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) He who loves God, prefers him before estate and life. Before
          estate. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things.' Phil 3: 8.
          Who that loves a rich jewel would not part with a flower for it?
          Galeacius, marquis of Vico, parted with a fair estate to enjoy God in
          his pure ordinances. When a Jesuit persuaded him to return to his
          popish religion in Italy, promising him a large sum of money, he said,
          Let their money perish with them who esteem all the gold in the world
          worth one day's communion with Jesus Christ and his Holy Spirit.'
          Before life. They loved not their lives unto the death.' Rev 12: 2:
          Love to God carries the soul above the love of life and the fear of
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) He who loves God loves his favourites, the saints.1 John 5: 1.
          Idem est motus animi in imaginem et rem [The mind reacts to the
          likeness of an object just as it does to the object itself]. To love a
          man for his grace, and the more we see of God in him, the more we love
          him, is an infallible sign of love to God. The wicked pretend to love
          God, but hate and persecute his image. Does he love his prince who
          abuses his statue, or tears his picture? They seem indeed to show
          great reverence to saints departed; they have great reverence for St.
          Paul, and St. Stephen, and St. Luke; they canonise dead saints, but
          persecute living saints; and do they love God? Can it be imagined that
          he loves God who hates his children because they are like him? If
          Christ were alive again, he would not escape a second persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) If we love God we cannot but be fearful of dishonouring him, as
          the more a child loves his father the more he is afraid to displease
          him, and we weep and mourn when we have offended him. Peter went out
          and wept bitterly.' Matt 26: 75. Peter might well think that Christ
          dearly loved him when he took him up to the mount where he was
          transfigured, and showed him the glory of heaven in a vision. That he
          should deny Christ after he had received such signal tokens of his
          love, broke his heart with grief He wept bitterly.' Are our eyes
          dropping tears of grief for sin against God? It is a blessed evidence
          of our love to God; and such shall find mercy. He shows mercy to
          thousands of them that love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use. Let us be lovers of God. We love our food, and shall we not love
          him that gives it? All the joy we hope for in heaven is in God; and
          shall not he who shall be our joy then, be our love now? It is a
          saying of Augustine, Annon poena satis magna est non amare te? Is it
          not punishment enough, Lord, not to love thee?' And again, Animam meam
          in odio haberem. I would hate my own soul if I did not find it loving
          God.'
        </p>
        <p>What are the incentives to provoke and inflame our love to God?</p>
        <p>
          (1) God's benefits bestowed on us. If a prince bestows continual
          favours on a subject, and that subject has any ingenuity, he cannot
          but love his prince. God is constantly heaping benefits upon us,
          filling our hearts with food and gladness.' Acts 14: 17. As streams of
          water out of the rock followed Israel whithersoever they went, so
          God's blessings follow us every day. We swim in a sea of mercy. That
          heart is hard that is not prevailed with by all God's blessings to
          love him. Magnes amoris amor [Love attracts love]. Kindness works even
          on a brute: the ox knows his owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Love to God would make duties of religion facile and pleasant. I
          confess that to him who has no love to God, religion must needs be a
          burden; and I wonder not to hear him say, What a weariness is it to
          serve the Lord!' It is like rowing against the tide. But love oils the
          wheels, it makes duty a pleasure. Why are the angels so swift and
          winged in God's service, but because they love him? Jacob thought
          seven years but little for the love he bare to Rachel. Love is never
          weary. He who loves money is not weary of telling it: and he who loves
          God is not weary of serving him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) It is advantageous. There is nothing lost by love to God. Eye has
          not seen, &amp;c., the things which God has prepared for them that
          love him.' 1 Cor 2: 9. Such glorious rewards are laid up for them that
          love God, that as Augustine says, they not only transcend our reason,
          but faith itself is not able to comprehend them.' A crown is the
          highest ensign of worldly glory; but God has promised a crown of life
          to them that love him,' and a never-fading crown. James 1: 12.1 Pet 5:
          4.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) By loving God we know that he loves us. We love him because he
          first loved us.' 1 John 5: 19. If ice melts, it is because the sun has
          shone upon it; so if the frozen heart melts in love, it is because the
          Sun of Righteousness has shone upon it.
        </p>
        <p>What means should be used to excite our love to God?</p>
        <p>
          (1) Labour to know God aright. The schoolmen say truly, Bonum non
          amatur quod non cognoscitur; we cannot love that which we do not
          know.' God is the most eligible good; all excellencies which lie
          scattered in the creature are united in him; he is Optimus maximus.
          Wisdom, beauty, riches, love, all concentrate in him. How fair was
          that tulip which had the colours of all tulips in it! All perfections
          and sweetnesses are eminently in God. Did we know God more, and by the
          eye of faith see his orient beauty, our hearts would be fired with
          love to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Make the Scriptures familiar to you. Augustine says that before
          his conversion he took no pleasure in Scripture, but afterwards it was
          his chief delight. The book of God discovers God to us, in his
          holiness, wisdom, veracity, and truth; it represents him as rich in
          mercy, and encircled with promises. Augustine calls the Scripture a
          golden epistle, or love-letter, sent from God to us. By reading this
          love-letter we become more enamoured with God; as by reading
          lascivious books, comedies, romances, &amp;c., lust is excited.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Meditate much upon God, and this will promote love to him. While I
          was musing, the fire burned.' Psa 39: 3. Meditation is as bellows to
          the affections. Meditate on God's love in the gift of Christ. God so
          loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,' &amp;c. John 3:
          16. That God should give Christ to us, and not to angels that fell,
          that the Sun of Righteousness should shine in our horizon, that he is
          revealed to us, and not to others; what wonderful love is this! Can
          one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?' Prov 6: 28. Who
          can meditate on God's love, who can tread on these hot coals, and his
          heart not burn in love? Beg a heart to love God. The affection of love
          is natural, but not the grace of love. Gal 5: 22. This fire of love is
          kindled from heaven; beg that it may burn upon the altar of your
          heart. Surely the request is pleasing to God, and he will not deny
          such a prayer as Lord, give me a heart to love thee.'
        </p>
        <p>VII. And keep my commandments.</p>
        <p>
          Love and obedience, like two sisters, must go hand and hand. If ye
          love me, keep my commandments.' John 14: 15. Probatio delectionis est
          exhibitio operis [We show our love by performing the work]. The son
          that loves his father will obey him. Obedience pleases God. To obey is
          better than sacrifice.' 1 Sam 15: 22. In sacrifice, a dead beast only
          is offered; in obedience, a living soul; in sacrifice, only a part of
          the fruit is offered; in obedience, fruit and tree and all; man offers
          himself up to God. Keep my commandments.' It is not said, God shows
          mercy to thousands that know his commandments, but that keep them.
          Knowing his commandments, without keeping them, does not entitle any
          to mercy. The commandment is not only a rule of knowledge, but of
          duty. God gives us his commandments, not only as a landscape to look
          upon, but as his will and testament, which we are to perform. A good
          Christian, like the sun, not only sends forth light, but makes a
          circuit round the world. He has not only the light of knowledge; but
          moves in a sphere of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should keep the commandments from faith. Our obedience ought,
          profluere a fide to spring from faith.' It is called, therefore, the
          obedience of faith.' Rom 16: 26. Abel, by faith, offered up a better
          sacrifice than Cain. Heb 11: 4. Faith is a vital principle, without
          which all our services are opera mortua, dead works. Heb 6: 1. It
          meliorates and sweetens obedience, and makes it come off with a better
          relish.
        </p>
        <p>But why must faith be mixed with obedience to the commandments?</p>
        <p>
          Because faith eyes Christ in every duty, in whom both the person and
          offering are accepted. The high-priest under the law laid his hand
          upon the head of the slain beast, which pointed to the Messiah. Exod
          29: 10. So faith in every duty lays its hand upon the head of Christ.
          His blood expiates their guilt, and the sweet odour of his
          intercession perfumes our works of obedience. He has made us accepted
          in the beloved.' Eph 1: 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping the commandments must be uniform. We must make conscience of
          one commandment as well as of another. Then shall I not be ashamed,
          when I have respect unto all thy commandments.' Psa 119: 6. Every
          commandment has jus divinum, the same stamp of divine authority upon
          it; and if I obey one precept because God commands, by the same reason
          I must obey all. Some obey the commands of the first table, but are
          careless of the duties of the second: some of the second and not of
          the first. Physicians have a rule that when the body sweats in one
          part, and is cold in another, it is a sign of a distemper; so when men
          seem zealous in some duties of religion, but are cold and frozen in
          others, it is a sign of hypocrisy. We must have respect to all God's
          commandments.
        </p>
        <p>But who can keep all his commandments?</p>
        <p>
          There is a fulfilling God's commands, and a keeping of them. Though we
          cannot fulfil all, yet we may be said to keep them in an evangelical
          sense. We may facere, though not perficere [build, though not
          complete]. We keep the commandments evangelically: (1) When we make
          conscience of every command, when, though we come short in every duty,
          we dare not neglect any. (2) When our desire is to keep every
          commandment. O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!' Psa
          119: 5. What we want in strength we make up in will. (3) When we
          grieve that we can do no better; weep when we fail; prefer bills of
          complaint against ourselves; and judge ourselves for our failings. Rom
          7: 24. (4) When we endeavour to obey every commandment, elicere
          conatum. I press toward the mark.' Phil 3: 14. We strive as in agony;
          and, if it lay in our power, we would fully comport with every
          commandment. (5) When, falling short, and unable to come up to the
          full latitude of the law, we look to Christ's blood to sprinkle our
          imperfect obedience, and, with the grains of his merits cast into the
          scales, to make it pass current. This, in an evangelical sense, is to
          keep all the commandments; and though it be not to satisfaction, yet
          it is to acceptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping God's commandments must be voluntary. If ye be willing and
          obedient.' Isa 1: 19. God required a free-will offering. Deut 16: 10.
          David will run the way of God's commandments, that is freely and
          cheerfully. Psa 119: 32. Lawyers have a rule that adverbs are better
          than adjectives; that it is not the bonum, but the bene; not the doing
          much, but the doing well. A musician is not commended for playing
          long, but for playing well. Obeying God willingly is accepted. Virtus
          nolentium nulla est [Righteous deeds done unwillingly are worthless].
          The Lord hates that which is forced; which is paying a tax rather than
          an offering. Cain served God grudgingly; he brought his sacrifice, not
          his heart. To obey God's commandments unwillingly, is like the devils
          who came out of the men possessed, at Christ's command, but with
          reluctance, and against their will. Matt 8: 29. Obedientia praest and
          adest non timore poenae, sed amore Dei [Obedience is the chief thing,
          and this not through fear of punishment, but for love of God]. God
          duties must not be pressed nor beaten out of us, as the waters came
          from the rock, when Moses smote it with his rod, but must drop freely
          from us as myrrh from the tree, or honey from the comb. If a willing
          mind be wanting, the flower is wanting to perfume our obedience, and
          to make it a sweet-smelling savour to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          That we may keep God's commandments willingly, let these things be
          well weighed: (1) Our willingness is more esteemed than our service.
          David counsels Solomon not only to serve God, but with a willing
          mind.1 Chron 28: 9. The will makes sin to be worse, and duty to be
          better. To obey willingly shows we do it with love; and this crowns
          all our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) There is that in the law-giver which may make us willing to obey
          the commandments, which is God's indulgence to us. God does not
          require the summum jus as absolutely necessary to salvation; he
          expects not perfect obedience, he requires sincerity only. Do but act
          from a principle of love, and aim at honouring God in your obedience,
          and it is accepted. In the gospel a surety is admitted. The law would
          not favour us so far; but now God so indulges us, that what we cannot
          do of ourselves we may do by proxy. Jesus Christ is a Surety of a
          better testament.' Heb 7: 22. We fall short in everything, but God
          looks upon us in our Surety; and Christ having fulfilled all
          righteousness, it is as if we had fulfilled the law in our own
          persons. God gives strength to do what he requires. The law called for
          obedience, but though it required brick, it gave no straw; but in the
          gospel, God, with his commands, gives power. Make ye a new heart.'
          Ezek 18: 31. Alas! it is above our strength, we may as well make a new
          world. A new heart also will I give you.' Ezek 36: 26. God commands us
          to cleanse ourselves. Wash you, make you clean.' Isa 1: 16. But who
          can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?' Job 14: 4. Therefore the
          precept is turned into a promise. From all your filthiness will I
          cleanse you.' Ezek 36: 25. When the child cannot go, the nurse takes
          it by the hand. I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their
          arms.' Hos 11: 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) There is that in God's commandments which may make us willing.
          They are not burdensome.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian, so far as he is regenerate, consents to God's commands. I
          consent to the law that it is good.' Rom 7: 16. What is done with
          consent is no burden. If a virgin gives her consent, the match goes on
          cheerfully; if a subject consents to his prince's laws because he sees
          the equity and reasonableness of them they are not irksome. A
          regenerate person in his judgement approves, and in his will consents,
          to God's commandments and therefore they are not burdensome.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's commandments are sweetened with joy and peace. Cicero questions
          whether that can properly be called a burden which is carried with
          delight and pleasure. Utrum onus appellatur quod laetitia fertur [Is a
          task performed with joy rightly so called]? If a man carries a bag of
          money that has been given him, it is heavy, but the delight takes off
          the burden. When God gives inward joy, it makes the commandments
          delightful. I will make them joyful in my house of prayer.' Isa 56: 7.
          Joy is like oil to the wheels, which makes a Christian run in the way
          of God's commandments, so that it is not burdensome.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's commandments are advantageous. They are preventive of evil; a
          curb-bit to check us from sin. What mischiefs should we not run into
          if we had not afflictions to humble us, and the commandments to
          restrain us! God's commandments keep us within bounds, as the yoke
          keeps the beast from straggling. We should be thankful to God for
          precepts. Had he not set his commandments as a hedge or bar in our
          way, we might have run to hell and never stopped. There is nothing in
          the commandments but what is for our good. To keep the commandments of
          the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee for thy good.' Deut
          10: 13. God commands us to read his word; and what hurt is in this? He
          bespangles the word with promises; as if a father should bid his son
          read his last will and testament, wherein he makes over a fair estate
          to him. He bids us pray and tells us if we ask, it shall be given.'
          Matt 7: 7. Ask power against sin, ask salvation, and it shall be
          given. If you had a friend who should say, Come when you will to me, I
          will supply you with money,' would you think it a trouble to visit
          that friend often? God commands us to fear him. But fear thy God.' Lev
          25: 43. There is honey in the mouth of this command. His mercy is on
          them that fear him.' Luke 1: 50. God commands us to believe, and why
          so? Believe, and thou shalt be saved.' Acts 16: 31. Salvation is the
          crown set upon the head of faith. Good reason then have we to obey
          God's commands willingly, since they are for our good, and are not so
          much our duty as our privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's commandments are ornamental. Omnia quae praestari jubet Deus,
          non onerant nos sed ornant. Salvianus. God's commandments do not
          burden us, but adorn us.' It is an honour to be employed in a king's
          service; and much more to be employed in his by whom kings reign.' To
          walk in God's commandments proves us to be wise. Behold, I have taught
          you statutes: keep, therefore, and do them; for this your wisdom.'
          Deut 4: 5, 6. To be wise is a great honour. We may say of every
          commandment of God, as Prov 4: 9: It shall give to thy head an
          ornament of grace.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The commands of God are infinitely better than the commands of sin,
          which are intolerable. Let a man be under the command of any lust, and
          how he tires himself! What hazards he runs to endangering his health
          and soul, that he may satisfy his lust! They weary themselves to
          commit iniquity.' Jer 9: 5. And are not God's commandments more equal,
          facile, pleasant, than the commands of sin? Chrysostom says true, To
          act virtue is easier than to act vice.' Temperance is less troublesome
          than drunkenness; meekness is less troublesome than passion and envy.
          There is more difficulty in the contrivance and pursuit of a wicked
          design than in obeying the commands of God. Hence a sinner is said to
          travail with iniquity. Psa 7: 14. A woman while she is in travail is
          in pain -- to show what pain and trouble a wicked man has in bringing
          forth sin. Many have gone with more pains to hell, than others have to
          heaven. This may make us obey the commandments willingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Willingness in obedience makes us resemble the angels. The cherubim,
          types representing the angels, are described with wings displayed, to
          show how ready the angels are to serve God. God no sooner speaks the
          word, but they are ambitious to obey. How are they ravished with joy
          while praising God! In heaven we shall be as the angels, and by our
          willingness to obey God's commands, we should be like them here. We
          pray that God's will may be done by us on earth as it is in heaven;
          and is it not done willingly there? It is also done constantly.
          Blessed is he who does righteousness at all times.' Psa 106: 3. Our
          obedience to the command must be as the fire of the altar, which never
          went out. Lev 6: 13. It must be as the motion of the pulse, always
          beating. The wind blows off the fruit; but the fruits of our obedience
          must not be blown off by any wind of persecution. I have chosen you
          that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
          remain.' John 15: 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use. They are reproved who live in a wilful breach of God's
          commandments, in malice, uncleanness, intemperance; and walk antipodes
          to the commandments. To live in a wilful breach of the commandment is:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Against reason. Are we able to stand out against God? Do we
          provoke the Lord, are we stronger than he?' 1 Cor 10: 22. Can we
          measure arms with God? Can impotence stand against omnipotence? A
          sinner acts against reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It is against equity. We have our being from God; and is it not
          just that we should obey him who gives us our being? We have all our
          subsistence from him; and is it not fitting, that as he gives us our
          allowance, we should give him our allegiance? If a general gives his
          soldiers pay, he expects them to march at his command; so for us to
          live in violation of the divine commands, is manifestly unjust.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) It is against nature. Every creature in its kind obeys God's law.
          Animate creatures obey him. God spake to the fish, and it set Jonah
          ashore. Jonah 2: 10. Inanimate creatures. The wind and the sea obey
          him. Mark 4: 41, The very stones, if God give them a commission, will
          cry out against the sins of men. The stone shall cry out of the wall,
          and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.' Hab 2: 11. None
          disobey God but wicked men and devils; and can we find no better
          companions?
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) It is against kindness. How many mercies have we to allure us to
          obey! We have miracles of mercy; the apostle therefore joins these two
          together, disobedient and unthankful, which dyes sin with a crimson
          colour.2 Tim 3: 2. As the sin is great, for it is a contempt of God, a
          hanging out of the flag of defiance against him, and rebellion is as
          the sin of witchcraft, so the punishment will be great. It cuts off
          from mercy. God's mercy is for them that keep his commandments, but
          there is no mercy for them that live in a wilful breach of them. All
          God's judgements set themselves in battle array against the
          disobedient: temporal judgements and eternal. Lev 26: 15, 16. Christ
          comes in flames of fire, to take vengeance on them that obey not God.2
          Thess 1: 8. God has iron chains to hold those who break the golden
          chain of his commands; chains of darkness by which the devils are held
          ever. Jude 6. God has time enough, as long as eternity, to reckon with
          all the wilful breakers of his commandments.
        </p>
        <p>How shall we keep God's commandments?</p>
        <p>
          Pray for the Spirit of God. We cannot do it in our strength. The
          Spirit must work in us both to will and to do. Phil 2: 13. When the
          loadstone draws, the iron moves; so, when God's Spirit draws, we run
          in the way of his commandments.<br />
