        <p>Is any man able perfectly to keep the commandments of God?</p>
        <p>
          No mere man, since the fall, is able in this life perfectly to keep
          the commandments of God, but does daily break them, in thought, word,
          and deed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many things we offend all.' James 3: 2. Man in his primitive state
          of innocence, was endowed with ability to keep the whole moral law. He
          had rectitude of mind, sanctity of will, and perfection of power. He
          had the copy of God's law written on his heart; no sooner did God
          command but he obeyed. As the key is suited to all the wards in the
          lock, and can open them, so Adam had a power suited to all God's
          commands, and could obey them. Adam's obedience ran parallel with the
          moral law, as a well made dial goes exactly with the sun. Man in
          innocence was like a well tuned organ, he was sweetly in tune to the
          will of God; he was adorned with holiness as the angels, but not
          confirmed in holiness as the angels. He was holy, but mutable; he fell
          from his purity, and we with him. Sin cut the lock of original
          righteousness where our strength lay; it brought a languor and
          faintness into our souls; and has so weakened us, that we shall never
          recover our full strength till we put on immortality. What I am now to
          demonstrate, is, that we cannot yield perfect obedience to the moral
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The case of an unregenerate man is such, that he cannot perfectly
          obey all God's commands. He may as well touch the stars, or span the
          ocean, as yield exact obedience to the law. A person unregenerate
          cannot act spiritually, he cannot pray in the Holy Ghost, he cannot
          live by faith, he cannot do duty out of love to duty; and if he cannot
          do duty spiritually, much less perfectly. Now, that a natural man
          cannot yield perfect obedience to the moral law, is evident. (1)
          Because he is spiritually dead. Eph 2: 1. How can he, being dead, keep
          the commandments of God perfectly? A dead man is not fit for action. A
          sinner has the symptoms of death upon him. He has no sense; he has no
          sense of the evil of sin, of God's holiness and veracity; therefore he
          is said to be without feeling. Eph 4: 19. He has no strength. Rom 5:
          6. What strength has a dead man? A natural man has no strength to deny
          himself, or to resist temptation; he is dead; and can a dead man
          fulfil the moral law? (2) A natural man cannot perfectly keep all
          God's commandments, because he is born in sin, and lives in sin. Psa
          51: 5. He drinketh iniquity like water.' Job 15: 16. All the
          imaginations of his thoughts are evil, and only evil. Gen 6: 5. The
          least evil thought is a breach of the royal law; and if there be
          defection, there cannot be perfection. As a natural man has no power
          to keep the moral law, so he has no will. He is not only dead, but
          worse than dead. A dead man does no hurt, but there is a life of
          resistance against God that accompanies the death of sin. A natural
          man not only cannot keep the law through weakness, but he breaks it
          through wilfulness. We will do whatsoever goes out of our own mouth,
          to burn incense unto the queen of heaven.' Jer 44: 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. As the unregenerate cannot keep the moral law perfectly, so
          neither can the regenerate. There is not a just man upon earth, that
          does good and sinneth not;' nay, that sins not in doing good.' Eccl 7:
          20. There is that in the best actions of a righteous man that is
          damnable, if God should weigh him in the balance of justice. Alas! how
          are his duties fly-blown! He cannot pray without wandering, nor
          believe without doubting. To will is present with me, but how to
          perform I find not.' In the Greek it is, How to do it thoroughly I
          find not.' Rom 7: 18. Paul, though a saint of the first magnitude, was
          better at willing than at performing. Mary asked where they had laid
          Christ; for she had a mind to have carried him away, but she wanted
          strength: so the regenerate have a will to obey God's law perfectly,
          but they want strength; their obedience is weak and sickly. The mark
          they are to shoot at, is perfection of holiness; but though they take
          a right aim, yet do what they can, they come short of the mark. The
          good that I would, I do not.' Rom 7: 19. A Christian, while serving
          God, like a ferry man that plies the oar, and rows hard, is hindered,
          for a gust of wind carries him back again: so says Paul, The good I
          would, I do not,' I am driven back by temptation. Now, if there be any
          failure in a man's obedience, he cannot be a perfect commentary upon
          God's law. The Virgin Mary's obedience was not perfect; she needed
          Christ's blood to wash her tears. Aaron was to make atonement for the
          altar, to show that the most holy offering has defilement in it, and
          needs atonement to be made for it. Exod 29: 37.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a man has no power to keep the whole moral law, why does God
          require it of him? Is this justice?
        </p>
        <p>
          Though man has lost his power of obeying, God has not lost his right
          of commanding. If a master entrusts a servant with money to lay out,
          and the servant spends it dissolutely, may not the master justly
          demand it? God gave us power to keep the moral law, which by tampering
          with sin, we lost; but may not God still call for perfect obedience,
          or, in case of default, justly punish us?
        </p>
        <p>Why does God permit such an inability in man to keep the law?</p>
        <p>
          He does it: (1) To humble us. Man is a self-exalting creature; and if
          he has but anything of worth, he is ready to be puffed up; but when he
          comes to see his deficiencies and failings, and how far short he comes
          of the holiness and perfection which God's law requires, it pulls down
          the plumes of his pride, and lays them in the dust; he weeps over his
          inability; he blushes over his leprous spots; he says with Job, I
          abhor myself in dust and ashes.' (2) God lets this inability be upon
          us, that we may have recourse to Christ to obtain pardon for our
          defects, and to sprinkle our best duties with his blood. When a man
          sees that he owes perfect obedience to the law, but has nothing to
          pay, it makes him flee to Christ to be his friend, and answer for him
          all the demands of the law, and set him free in the court of justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use one. Here is matter of humiliation for our fall in Adam. In the
          state of innocence we were perfectly holy; our minds were crowned with
          knowledge, and our wills, as a queen, swayed the sceptre of liberty;
          but now we may say, The crown is fallen from our head.' Lam 5: 16. We
          have lost that power which was inherent in us. When we look back to
          our primitive glory, when we shone as earthly angels, we may take up
          Job's words, Oh that I were as in months past!' chap 29: 2. that it
          were with us as at first, when there was no stain upon our virgin
          nature, when there was a perfect harmony between God's law and man's
          will! But, alas! how is the scene altered, our strength is gone from
          us; we tread awry at every step: we come below every precept; our
          dwarfishness will not reach the sublimity of God's law; we fail in our
          obedience; and while we fail, we forfeit. This should put us in deep
          mourning, and spring a leak of sorrow in all our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use two. Of confutation. (1) It confutes the Armenians, who cry up the
          power of the will. They hold they have a will to save themselves. But
          by nature, we not only want strength, but we want will to that which
          is good. Rom 5: 6. The will is not only full of weakness, but
          obstinacy. Israel would none of me.' Psa 81: 11. The will hangs forth
          a flag of defiance against God. Such as speak of the sovereign power
          of the will, forget It is God that worketh in you both to will and to
          do.' Phil 2: 13. If the power be in the will of man, then what need is
          there for God to work in us to will? If the air can enlighten itself,
          what need is there for the sun to shine? Such as talk of the power of
          nature, and their ability to save themselves, disparage Christ's
          merits. I may say (as Gal 5: 4), Christ has become of no effect to
          them.' They who advance the power of their will in matters of
          salvation, without the medicinal grace of Christ, do absolutely put
          themselves under the covenant of works. I would ask, Can they
          perfectly keep the moral law?' Malum oritur ex quolibet defectu [Evil
          is manifested in any blemish at all]. If there be but the least defect
          in their obedience, they are lost. For one sinful thought the law of
          God curses them, and the justice of God condemns them. Confounded be
          their pride, who cry up the power of nature, as if, by their own
          inherent abilities, they could rear up a building, the top whereof
          should reach to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It confutes that sort of people who brag of perfection; and who,
          according to that principle, can keep all God's commandments
          perfectly. I would ask such whether at no time a vain thought has come
          into their minds? If there has, then they are not perfect. The Virgin
          Mary was not perfect. Though her womb was pure (being overshadowed by
          the Holy Ghost), yet her soul was not perfect. Christ tacitly supposes
          a failing in her. Luke 2: 49. And are they more perfect than the
          blessed Virgin was? Such as hold perfection, need not confess sin.
          David confessed sin, and Paul confessed sin. Psa 32: 5; Rom 7: 25. But
          they are got beyond David and Paul; they are perfect, they never
          transgress; and where there is no transgression, what need for
          confession? Again, if they are perfect, they need not ask pardon. They
          can pay God's justice what they owe; therefore, why pray, Forgive us
          our debts'? Oh, that the devil should rock men so fast asleep, as to
          make them dream of perfection! Do they plead, Let us therefore as many
          as be perfect be thus minded'? Phil 3: 15. Perfection there, is meant
          of sincerity. God is best able to interpret his own word. He calls
          sincerity perfection. A perfect and an upright man.' Job 1: 8. But who
          is exactly perfect? A man full of diseases may as well say he is
          healthful, as a man full of sins say he is perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use three. For encouragement to regenerate persons. Though you fail in
          your obedience, and cannot keep the moral law exactly, yet be not
          discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          What comfort may be given to a regenerate person under the failures
          and imperfections of his obedience?
        </p>
        <p>
          That a believer is not under the covenant of works, but under the
          covenant of grace. The covenant of works requires perfect, personal,
          perpetual obedience; but in the covenant of grace, God will make some
          abatements; he will accept less than he required in the covenant of
          works. (1) In the covenant of works God required perfection of
          degrees; in the covenant of grace he accepts perfection of parts.
          There he required perfect working, here he accepts sincere believing.
          In the covenant of works, God required us to live without sin; in the
          covenant of grace he accepts of our combat with sin. (2) Though a
          Christian cannot, in his own person, perform all God's commandments;
          yet Christ, as his Surety, and in his stead, has fulfilled the law for
          him: and God accepts of Christ's obedience, which is perfect, to
          satisfy for that obedience which is imperfect. Christ being made a
          curse for believers, all the curses of the law have their sting pulled
          out. (3) Though a Christian cannot keep the commands of God to
          satisfaction, yet he may to approbation.
        </p>
        <p>How is that?</p>
        <p>
          (1) He gives his full assent and consent to the law of God. The law is
          holy and just:' there was assent in the judgement. Rom 7: 12. I
          consent unto the law;' there was consent in the will. Rom 7: 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) A Christian mourns that he cannot keep the commandments fully.
          When he fails he weeps; he is not angry with the law because it is so
          strict but he is angry with himself because he is so deficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) He takes a sweet complacent delight in the law. I delight in the
          law of God after the inward man.' Rom 7: 22. Greek: I take pleasure in
          it.' O! how love I thy law.' Psa 119: 97. Though a Christian cannot
          keep God's law, yet he loves his law; though he cannot serve God
          perfectly, yet he serves him willingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) It is his cordial desire to walk in all God's commands. O that my
          ways were directed to keep thy statutes.' Psa 119: 5. Though his
          strength fails, yet his pulse beats.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) He really endeavours to obey God's law perfectly; and wherein he
          comes short he runs to Christ's blood to supply his defects. This
          cordial desire, and real endeavour, God esteems as perfect obedience.
          If there be a willing mind, it is accepted.' 2 Cor 8: 12. Let me hear
          thy voice, for sweet is thy voice.' Cant 2: 14. Though the prayers of
          the righteous are mixed with sin, yet God sees they would pray better.
          He picks out the weeds from the flowers; he sees the faith and bears
          with the failing. The saints' obedience, though short of legal
          perfection, yet having sincerity in it, and Christ's merits mixed with
          it, finds gracious acceptance. When the Lord sees endeavours after
          perfect obedience, he takes it well at our hands; as a father who
          receives a letter from his child, though there be blots in it, and
          false spellings, takes all in good part. Oh! what blotting are there
          in our holy things; but God is pleased to take all in good part. He
          says, It is my child, and he would do better if he could; I will
          accept it.'
