        <p>Matthew 6:13 -- "Lead us not into temptation."</p>
        <p>
          The great and important duty which is incumbent on Christians, is to
          guard against all appearance of evil; to watch against the first
          risings in the heart to evil; and to have a guard upon our actions,
          that they may not be sinful, or so much as seem to be so. It is true,
          the devil is tempting us continually, and our own evil hearts are
          ready to join with the tempter, to make us fall into sins, that he
          thereby may obtain a victory over us, and that we, my brethren, may be
          his subjects, his servants, his slaves; and then by-and-by he will pay
          us our wages, which will be death temporal, and death eternal. Our
          Lord Jesus Christ saw how his people would be tempted; and that the
          great enemy of their souls would lay hold of every opportunity, so he
          could but be a means of keeping poor sinners from coming to the Lord
          Jesus Christ; hurrying you with temptation, to drive you to some great
          sins; and then if he cannot gain you over, sell it to a smaller, and
          suit his temptations time after time; and when he finds none of these
          things will do, often transform himself into an angel of light, and by
          that means make the soul fall into sin, to the dishonor of God, and
          the wounding of itself; the Lord Jesus, I say, seeing how liable his
          disciples, and all others, would be to be overcome by temptation,
          therefore advises them, when they pray, to beg that they might not be
          led into temptation. It is so dangerous to engage so subtle and
          powerful an enemy as Satan is, that we shall be overcome as often as
          we engage, unless the Lord is on our side. My brethren, if you were
          left to yourselves, you would be overcome by every temptation with
          which you are beset.
        </p>
        <p>
          These words are part of the prayer which Christ taught his disciples;
          and I shall, therefore, make no doubt, but that you all believe them
          to be true, since they are spoken by one who cannot lie. I shall,
        </p>
        <p>I. Show you who it is that tempts you.</p>
        <p>II. Shall show, my brethren, why he tempts you.</p>
        <p>
          III. Mention some of the ways and means he makes use of, to draw you
          over to his temptations.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Let you see how earnest you ought to be to the Lord, that he may
          preserve you from being led into temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I shall make some application by way of entreaty unto you, to come
          unto Christ, that he, my brethren, may deliver you from being tempted.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, We are to consider who it is that tempts us.</p>
        <p>
          And the tempter is Satan, the prince of the power of the air, he that
          now ruleth in the children of disobedience; he is an enemy to God and
          goodness, he is a hater of all truth. Why else did he slander God in
          paradise? Why did he tell Eve, "You shall not surely die?" He is full
          of malice, envy, and revenge; for what reasons else could induce him
          to molest innocent man in paradise? The person that tempts ye, my
          brethren, is remarkable for his subtlety; for having not power given
          him from above, he is obliged to wait for opportunities to betray us,
          and to catch us by guile; he, therefore, made use of the serpent to
          tempt our first parents; and to lie in wait to deceive, is another
          part of his character. And though this character is given of the
          devil, if we were to examine our own hearts, we should find many of
          the tempter's characters legible in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not many of you love to make a lie? And if it is done in your
          trade; you therefore look on it as excusable; but whether you believe
          it or not, it is sinful, it is exceedingly sinful. Though you may
          value yourselves as fine rational creatures, and that you are noble
          beings; and you were so, as you first came out of God's hands; but now
          you are fallen, there is nothing lovely, nothing desirable in man; his
          heart is a sink of pollution, full of sin and uncleanness: Yet, though
          a man's own heart is so desperately wicked, he is told by our modern
          polite preachers, that there is a fitness in men, and that God seeing
          you a good creature, gives you his grace; but this, though it is a
          modern, polite, and fashionable way of talking, is very unscriptural;
          it is very contrary to the doctrines of the Reformation, and to our
          own Articles. But however contrary to the doctrines of the Church of
          England, yet our pulpits ring of nothing more, than doing no one any
          harm, living honestly, loving your neighbor as yourselves, and do what
          you can, and then Christ is to make up the deficiency: this is making
          Christ to be half a savior, and man the other part; but I say, Christ
          will be your whole righteousness, your whole wisdom, your whole
          sanctification, or else he will never be your whole redemption. How
          amazing is it, that the ministers of the church of England should
          speak quite contrary to what they have subscribed! Good God! If these
          are the guides of the ignorant, and esteemed to be the true ministers
          of Jesus, because they have a great share of letter-learning; when at
          the same time they are only the blind leaders of the blind; and
          without a special Providence, they both will fall into the ditch.
        </p>
        <p>
          No wonder at people's talking of the fitness and unfitness of things,
          when they can tell us, that the Spirit of God, is a good conscience,
          and the comforts of the Holy Ghost are consequent thereupon. But this
          is wrong; for it should be said, the Spirit of God, are the comforts
          of the Holy Ghost, and a good conscience consequent thereupon. Seneca,
          Cicero, Plato, or any of the heathen philosophers, would have given as
          good a definition as this; it means no more than reflecting we have
          done well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let these modern, polite gentlemen, and let my letter-learned
          brethren, paint man in as lovely colors as they please, I will not do
          it; I dare not make him better than the word of God does. If I was to
          paint man in his proper colors, I must go to the kingdom of hell for a
          copy; for man is by nature full of pride, subtlety, malice, envy,
          revenge, and all uncharitableness; and what are these but the temper
          of the devil? And lust, sensuality, pleasure, these are the tempers of
          the beast. Thus, my brethren, man is half a beast, and half a devil, a
          motley mixture of the beast and devil. And this is the creature, who
          has made himself so obnoxious to the wrath of God, and open to his
          indignation, that is told, that he must be part his own savior, by
          doing good works, and what he cannot do Christ will do for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is giving the tempter great room to come in with his temptation;
          he may press a soul to follow moral duties, to go to church, take the
          sacrament, read, pray, meditate; the devil is well content you should
          do all these; but if they are done in your own strength, or if you go
          no farther than here, you are only going a smoother way to hell.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, my brethren, you may see who it is that tempts us. But</p>
        <p>II. Why he tempts you, is the second thing I am to show you.</p>
        <p>
          It is our of envy to you, and to the Lord Jesus Christ, he endeavors
          to keep you from closing with Jesus; and if he can but keep you from
          laying hold by faith on Christ, he knows he has you safe enough; and
          the more temptations you are under, and according to their nature and
          greatness, you are more hurried in your minds; and the more unsettled
          your thoughts and affections are, the more apt you are to conclude,
          that if you were to go to Christ, at present, in all that hurry of
          mind, he would not receive you; but this is a policy of the tempter,
          to make you have low and dishonorable thoughts of the blessed Jesus;
          and so by degrees he works upon your minds, that you are careless and
          indifferent about Christ. This, this, my brethren, is the design of
          the tempter. Nothing will please him more, than to see you ruined and
          lost forever. He tempts you for that end, that you may lose your
          interest in Jesus Christ, and that you may dwell with him and apostate
          spirits to all eternity. He knows that Jesus Christ died for sinners,
          yet he would fain keep souls from seeking to this city of refuge for
          shelter, and from going to Gilead for the true balm.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is he that rules in thy heart, O scoffer, O Pharisee; the devil
          reigns there, and endeavors to blind your eyes, that you shall not see
          what danger you are in, and how much evil there is in those hearts of
          yours; and as long as he can keep you easy and unconcerned about
          having your hearts changed, he will be easy; though if he can, he will
          tempt you to sin against him, until you are hardened in your iniquity.
          O, my brethren, do not give the devil a handle wherewith he may lay
          hold on you; alas! it is not wonder that the devil tempts you, when he
          finds you at a play, a ball, or masquerade; if you are doing the
          devil's work, it is no wonder if he presses you in the continuation
          thereof; and how can any say, "Lead us not into temptation," in the
          morning, when they are resolved to run into it at night? Good God! Are
          these persons members of the church of England? Alas, when you have
          gone to church, and read over the prayers, it is offering no more than
          the sacrifice of fools; you say Amen to them with your lips, when in
          your hearts you are either unconcerned at what you are about, or else
          you think that the bare saying of your prayers is sufficient, and that
          then God and you have balanced accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my dear brethren, do not deceive yourselves, God is not to be
          mocked. You are only ruining yourselves for time and eternity. You
          pray, "lead us not into temptation," when you are tempting the devil
          to come and tempt you.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall now point out some of the ways and means, he makes use of
          to draw you to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is a field so large, and I have but just begun to be a
          soldier of Jesus Christ, that I cannot name many unto you. I shall
          therefore be very short on this head.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He endeavors to make you think sin is not so great as it is; that
          there is no occasion of being so over-strict, and that you are
          righteous over-much; that you are ostentatious [showy, pompous,
          egotistical], and will do yourself harm by it; and that you will
          destroy yourselves. He shows you, by brethren, the bait, but he hides
          the hook; he shows you the pleasure, profits, and advantages, that
          attend abundance of this world's goods; but he does not show you
          crosses, losses and vexations that you may have while you are in the
          enjoyment of the blessings of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When he finds he cannot allure you by flattery, he will try you by
          frowns, and the terrors of this world; he will stir up people to point
          at you, and cry, "Here comes another troop of his followers;" He will
          stir them up to jeer, scoff, backbite, and hate you; but if he still
          finds this will not do, then he throws doubts, my brethren, and
          discouragement in your mind, whether the way you are in is the true
          way or not; or else he will suggest, What! Do you expect to be saved
          by Christ? Also, He did not die for you; you have been too great a
          sinner; you have lived in sin so long, and committed such sins against
          Christ, which he will not forgive. Thus he hurries poor sinners almost
          into despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          And very often, when the people of God are met to worship him, he
          sends his agents, the scoffers, to disturb them. We saw an instance of
          their rage just now; they would fain have disturb us; but the Lord was
          on our side, and so prevented all the attempts of wicked and designing
          men, to disturb and disquiet us. Lord Jesus, forgive them who are thus
          persecuting thy truth! Jesus, show them that they are fighting against
          thee, and that it is hard for them to kick against the pricks! These,
          my brethren, are some of the ways Satan takes, in is temptations, to
          bring you from Christ. Many more might be named; but these are
          sufficient, I hope, to keep you on your guard, against all that the
          enemy can do to hinder you from coming to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I come to show you, how earnest you ought to be with Jesus Christ,
          either not to suffer you to be led into temptations, or to preserve
          you under them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here, my dear brethren, let me beseech you to go to Jesus Christ;
          tell him, how you are assaulted by the evil one, who lies in wait for
          your souls; tell him, you are not able to master him, in your own
          strength; beg his assistance, and you shall find him ready to help
          you; ready to assist you, and to be your Guide, your Comforter, your
          Savior, your All; He will give you strength to resist the fiery darts
          of the devil; and, therefore, you can no where find one so proper to
          relieve you, as Jesus Christ; he knows what it is to be tempted; he
          was tempted by Satan in the wilderness, and he will give you the
          assistance of his Spirit, to resist the evil one, and then he will fly
          from you. In Christ Jesus you shall have the strength you stand in
          need of, the devil shall have no power; therefore fear not, for in the
          name of the Lord we shall overcome all our spiritual Amalekites. Let
          the devil and his agents rage, let them breathe out threatenings, yes,
          let them breathe out slaughters, yet we can rejoice in this, that
          Jesus Christ hath them in his power, they shall go no farther than he
          permits them; they may rage, they may rage horribly, but they can go
          no farther, until they have got more power from on high.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they could do us what mischief they would, very few of us should be
          permitted to see our habitations any more; but, blessed be God, we can
          commit ourselves to his protection; he has been our protector
          hitherto, he will be so still. Then earnestly entreat of the Lord to
          support you under those temptations, which the devil may assault you
          with; he is a powerful adversary, he is a cunning one too; he would be
          too hard for us, unless we have the strength of Christ to be with us.
          But let us be looking up unto Jesus, that he would send his Spirit
          into our hearts, and keep us from falling. O my dear brethren in
          Christ Jesus, how stands it now between God and your souls? Is Jesus
          altogether lovely to your souls? Is he precious unto you? I am sure,
          if you have not gone back from Christ, he will not from you; he will
          root out the accursed things of this world, and dwell in your hearts.
          You are candidates for heaven; and will you mind earth ? What are all
          the pleasures of earth, without an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ?
          And one smile from him is more to be desired than rubies, yea more
          than the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          O you who have found Jesus Christ assisting you, and supporting you
          under all the temptations of this life, will you forsake him? Have you
          not found him a gracious master? Is he not the chiefest of ten
          thousand, and altogether lovely? Now you see a form and comeliness in
          Christ, which you never saw before. O! how do you and I wish we had
          known Jesus sooner, and that we had more of his love; it is
          condescending love, it is amazing, it is forgiving love, it is dying
          love, it is exalted and interceding love, and it is glorified love.
          Methinks when I am talking of the love of Jesus Christ, who loved me
          before I love him; he saw us polluted in blood, full of sores, a slave
          to sin, to death and hell, running to destruction, then he passed by
          me, and said unto my soul, "Live;" he snatched me as a brand plucked
          from the burning. It was love that saved me, it was all of the free
          grace of God, and that only. The little experience I have had of this
          love, makes me amazed at the condescension, the love, and mercifulness
          of the blessed Jesus, that he should have mercy upon such a wretch. O,
          my brethren, the kingdom of God is within me, and this fills me so
          full of love, that I would not be in my natural state again, not for
          millions of millions of worlds; I long to be with Jesus, to live with
          the Lord that bought me, to live forever with the Lamb that was slain,
          and to sing Hallelujah's unto him. Eternity itself will be too short
          to set forth the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot, indeed I
          cannot forbear speaking again, and again, and again, of the Lord
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if there are any here who are strangers to this love of the Lord
          Jesus Christ, do not despair; come, come unto Christ, and he will have
          mercy upon you, he will pardon all your sins, he will heal all your
          backslidings, he will love you freely, and take you to be with
          himself.. Come therefore, O my guilty brethren, unto Jesus, and you
          shall find rest for your souls. You need not fear, you need not
          despair, when God has had mercy upon such a wretch as I; and he will
          save you also, if you will come unto him by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do ye delay? What! Do you say, you are poor, and therefore ashamed
          to come? It is not your poverty that Christ mindeth; come in all your
          rags, in all your pollution, and he will save you. Do not depend upon
          any thing but the blood of Jesus Christ; do not stand out an hour
          longer, but give your hearts to Christ, give him the firstlings of the
          flock; come unto him now, lest he should cut you off before you are
          prepared, and your soul be sent to that pit from whence there is no
          redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not waver, but give him that which he desires, your hearts; it is
          the heart the Lord Jesus Christ wanteth; and when you have an inward
          principle wrought in your hearts by this same Jesus, then you will
          feel the sweetness and pleasure of communion with God. O consider, my
          brethren, the love of the Lord Jesus Christ, in dying for you; and are
          you resolved to slight his dying love? Your sins brought Christ from
          heaven, and I humbly pray to the Lord that they may not be a means of
          sending you to hell. What language will make you leave your sins and
          come to Christ? O that I did but know! And that it lay in my power to
          give you this grace; not one of you, not the greatest scoffer here
          should go hence before he was changed from a natural to a spiritual
          life; then, then we would rejoice and take sweet council together; but
          all this is not in my power; but I tell you where you may have it,
          even of the Lord Jesus; he will give it to you, if you ask it of him,
          for he has told us, "Ask, and you shall receive;" therefore ask of
          him, and if you are repulsed again and again, entreat him more, and he
          will be unto you as he was to the poor Syrophoenician woman, who came
          to Christ on account of her daughter; and is she was so importunate to
          him for a body, how much more should we be solicitous for our souls?
          If you seek to him in faith, his answer will be to you as it was to
          her, "Thy faith hath saved thee, be it as thou wouldest have it."
        </p>
        <p>
          O, do not forsake the seeking of the Lord; do not, I beseech you,
          neglect the opportunities which may be offered to you, for the
          salvation of your souls; forsake not the assembling of yourselves
          together, to build up and confirm and strengthen those who are weak in
          faith; to convince sinners, that they may feel the power of God
          pricking them in their hearts, and make them cry out, "What must we do
          to be saved?"

          The devil and his agents have their clubs of reveling, and their
          societies of drunkenness; they are not ashamed to be seen and heard
          doing the devil their master's works; they are not ashamed to proclaim
          him; and sure you are not ashamed of the Lord Jesus Christ; you dare
          proclaim that Jesus, who died that you might live, and who will own
          you before his Father and all the holy angels; Therefore, dare to be
          singularly good; be not afraid of the face of man; let not all the
          threats of the men of this world move you; what is the loss of all the
          grandeur, or pleasure, or reputation of this life, compared to the
          loss of heaven, of Christ and of your souls? And as for the reproaches
          of the world, do not mind them; when they revile you, never, never
          revile again; do not answer railing with railing; but let love,
          kindness, meekness, patience, long-suffering, be found in you, as they
          were in the blessed Jesus; therefore, I beseech you, do not neglect
          the frequent coming together, and telling each other, what great
          things Jesus Christ hath done for your souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not now, as the Pharisees say I do, encourage you to leave your
          lawful callings, and your business, in which God, by his providence,
          hath placed you; for you have two callings, the one a general, and the
          other a special one; it is your duty to regard your families, and if
          you neglect them out of any pretense whatever, as going to church or
          in societies, you are out of the way of your duty, and offering that
          to God which he commanded you not. But then, my brethren, you are to
          take care that the things of this life do not hinder the preparing for
          that which is to come; let not the business of the world make you
          unmindful of your souls; but in all your moral actions, in the
          business of life, let all be done with a view to the glory of God, and
          the salvation of your souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nigh draws on, and obliges me to hasten to a conclusion; though,
          methinks, I could speak until my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth,
          yes, until I could speak no more, if it was to save your souls from
          the paws of him who seeketh to devour you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore let me beseech you, in all love and compassion; Consider,
          you, who are Pharisees; you, who will not come to Christ, but are
          trusting to yourselves for righteousness; who think, because you lead
          civil, honest, decent lives, all will go well at last; but let me tell
          you, O ye Pharisees, that harlots, murderers, and thieves, shall enter
          the kingdom of God before you. Do not flatter yourselves of being in
          the way to heaven, when you are in the broad way to hell; but if you
          will throw away your righteousness and come to Christ, and be
          contented to let Jesus Christ do all for you, and in you, then Christ
          is willing to be your Savior; but if you bring your good works with
          you, and think to be justified on the account of them, you may seek to
          be justified by them forever, and never be justified; no, it is only
          the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanseth us from the filth and
          pollution of all our sins; and you must be sanctified before you are
          justified. As for good works, we are justified before God without any
          respect to them, either past, present, or to come: when w are
          justified, good works will follow our justification, for we can do no
          good works, until we are cleansed of our pollution, by the
          sanctification of the Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          O ye scoffers, come and see this Jesus, this Lord of glory whom you
          have despised; and if you will but come to Christ, he will be willing
          to receive you, notwithstanding all the persecution you have used
          towards his members; However, if you are resolved to persist in your
          obstinacy, remember, salvation was offered to you, that Christ and
          free grace were proposed; but you refused to accept of either, and
          therefore your blood will be required at your own hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall only say this unto you, that however you may despise either me
          or my ministry, I shall not regard it, but shall frequently show you
          your danger, and propose to you the remedy; and shall earnestly pity
          and pray for you, that God would show you your error, and bring you
          home into his sheepfold, that you, from ravenous lions, may become
          peaceful lambs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for you, O my brethren, who desire to choose Christ for you
          Lord, and to experience his power upon your souls, and as you do not
          find your desires and prayers answered; go on, and Christ will
          manifest himself unto you, as he does not unto the world; you shall be
          made to see and feel this love of Jesus upon your souls; you shall
          have a witness in your own breast, that you are the Lord's; therefore,
          do not fear, the Lord Jesus Christ will gather you with his elect,
          when he comes at that great day of accounts, to judge every one
          according to the deeds done in the body, whether they be good, or
          whether they be evil; and, O that the thought of answering to God for
          all our actions, would make us more mindful about the consequences
          that will attend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now let me address all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one
          with another, to accept of mercy and grace while it is offered to you;
          Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation; and will you
          not accept it, now it is offered unto you? Do not stand out one moment
          longer; but come and accept of Jesus Christ in his own way, and then
          you shall be taken up at the last day, and be with him forever and
          ever; and sure this should make you desirous of being with that Jesus
          who has done so much for you, and is not interceding for you, and
          preparing mansions for you; where may we all arrive and sit down with
          Jesus to all eternity!
        </p>
        <p>Which God of his infinite mercy grant, &amp;c<br /></p>
