          Of all the verses in the book of God, this which I have now read to
          you, is, I believe, one of the most comprehensive: what glad tidings
          does it bring to believers! What precious privileges are they herein
          invested with! How are they here led to the fountain of them all, I
          mean, the love, the everlasting love of God the Father! Of him are ye
          in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
          sanctification, and redemption.'
        </p>
        <p>Without referring you to the context, I shall from the words,</p>
        <p>
          First, Point out to you the fountain, from which all those blessings
          flow, that the elect of God partake of in Jesus Christ, "Who of God is
          made unto'. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I shall consider what these blessings are, Wisdom,
          righteousness, sanctification, and redemption'.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I would point out to you the fountain, from which all those
          blessings flow, that the elect of God partake of in Jesus, who of God
          is made unto us', the father he it is who is spoken of here. Not as
          though Jesus Christ was not God also; but God the Father is the
          fountain of the Deity; and if we consider Jesus Christ acting as
          Mediator, God the Father is greater than he; there was an eternal
          contract between the Father and the Son: "I have made a covenant with
          my chosen, and I have sworn unto David my servant'; now David was a
          type of Christ, with whom the Father made a covenant, that if he would
          obey and suffer, and make himself a sacrifice for sin, he should see
          his seed, he should prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord
          should prosper in his hands'. This compact our Lord refers to, in that
          glorious prayer recorded in the 17th chapter of John; and therefore he
          prays for, or rather demands with a full assurance, all that were
          given to him by the Father: Father, I will that they also whom thou
          hast given me, be with me where I am.' For this same reason, the
          apostle breaks out into praises of God, even the Father of our Lord
          Jesus Christ; for he loved the elect with an everlasting love, or, as
          our Lord expresses it, before the foundation of the world'; and,
          therefore, to show them to whom they were beholden for their
          salvation, our Lord, in the 25th of Matthew, represents himself
          saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom
          prepared for you from the foundation of the world'. And thus, in reply
          to the mother of Zebedee's children, he says, It is not mine to give,
          but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of the Father'.
          The apostle therefore, when here speaking of the Christian's
          privileges, lest they should sacrifice to their own drag, or think
          their salvation was owing to their own faithfulness, or improvement of
          their own free-will, reminds them to look back on the everlasting love
          of God the Father; who of God is made unto us', etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would to God this point of doctrine was considered more, and people
          were more studious of the covenant of redemption between the Father
          and the Son! We should not then have so much disputing against the
          doctrine of election, or hear it condemned (even by good men) as a
          doctrine of devils. For my own part, I cannot see how true humbleness
          of mind can be attained without a knowledge of it; and though I will
          not say, that every one who denies election is a bad man, yet I will
          say, with that sweet singer, Mr. Trail, it is a very bad sign: such a
          one, whoever he be, I think cannot truly know himself; for, if we deny
          election, we must, partly at least, glory in ourselves; but our
          redemption is so ordered that no flesh should glory in the Divine
          presence; and hence it is, that the pride of man opposes this
          doctrine, because, according to this doctrine, and no other, he that
          glories, must glory only in the Lord'. But what shall I say? Election
          is a mystery that shines with such resplendent brightness, that, to
          make use of the words of one who has drunk deeply of electing love, it
          dazzles the weak eyes even of some of God's dear children; however,
          though they know it not, all the blessings they receive, all the
          privileges they do or ill enjoy, through Jesus Christ, flow from the
          everlasting love of God the Father: But of him are you in Christ
          Jesus, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, righteousness,
          sanctification, and redemption.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I come to show what these blessings are, which are here,
          through Christ, made over to the elect. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1: First, Christ is made to them wisdom; but wherein does true wisdom
          consist? Were I to ask some of you, perhaps you would say, in
          indulging the lust of the flesh, and saying to your souls, eat, drink,
          and be merry: but this is only the wisdom of brutes; they have as good
          a gust and relish for sensual pleasures, as the greatest epicure on
          earth. Others would tell me, true wisdom consisted in adding house to
          house, and field to field, and calling lands after their own names:
          but this cannot be true wisdom; for riches often take to themselves
          wings, and fly away, like an eagle towards heaven. Even wisdom itself
          assures us, that a man's life doth not consist in the abundance of the
          things which he possesses'; vanity, vanity, all these things are
          vanity; for, if riches leave not the owner, the owners must soon leave
          them; for rich men must also die, and leave their riches for others';
          their riches cannot procure them redemption from the grave, whither we
          are all hastening apace.
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps you despise riches and pleasure, and therefore place
          wisdom in the knowledge of books: but it is possible for you to tell
          the numbers of the stars, and call them all by their names, and yet be
          mere fools; learned men are not always wise; nay, our common learning,
          so much cried up, makes men only so many accomplished fools; to keep
          you therefore no longer in suspense, and withal to humble you, I will
          send you to a heathen to school, to learn what true wisdom is: Know
          thyself', was a saying of one of the wise men of Greece; this is
          certainly true wisdom, and this is that wisdom spoken of in the text,
          and which Jesus Christ is made to all elect sinners -- they are made
          to know themselves, so as not to think more highly of themselves than
          they ought to think. Before, they were darkness; now, they are light
          in the Lord; and in that light they see their own darkness; they now
          bewail themselves as fallen creatures by nature, dead in trespasses
          and sins, sons and heirs of hell, and children of wrath; they now see
          that all their righteousnesses are but as filthy rags; that there is
          no health in their souls; that they are poor and miserable, blind and
          naked; and that there is no name given under heaven, whereby they can
          be saved, but that of Jesus Christ. They see the necessity of closing
          with a Savior, and behold the wisdom of God in appointing him to be a
          Savior; they are also made willing to accept of salvation upon our
          Lord's own terms, and receive him as their all in all; thus Christ is
          made to them wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secondly, righteousness, Who of God is made unto us, wisdom,
          righteousness': Christ's whole personal righteousness is made over to,
          and accounted theirs. They are enabled to lay hold on Christ by faith,
          and God the Father blots out their transgressions, as with a thick
          cloud: their sins and their iniquities he remembers no more; they are
          made the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, who is the end of the
          law for righteousness to every one that believeth'. In one sense, God
          now sees no sin in them; the whole covenant of works is fulfilled in
          them; they are actually justified, acquitted, and looked upon as
          righteous in the sight of God; they are perfectly accepted in the
          beloved; they are complete in him; the flaming sword of God's wrath,
          which before moved every way, is not removed, and free access given to
          the tree of life; they are enabled to reach out the arm of faith, and
          pluck, and live for evermore. Hence it is that the apostle, under a
          sense of this blessed privilege, breaks out into this triumphant
          language; It is Christ that justifies, who is he that condemns?' Does
          sin condemn? Christ's righteousness delivers believers from the guilt
          of it: Christ is their Savior, and is become a propitiation for their
          sins: who therefore shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?
          Does the law condemn? By having Christ's righteousness imputed to
          them, they are dead to the law, as a covenant of works; Christ has
          fulfilled it for them, and in their stead. Does death threaten them?
          They need not fear: the sting of death is sin, the strength of sin is
          the law; but God has given them the victory by imputing to them the
          righteousness of the Lord Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what a privilege is here! Well might the angels at the birth of
          Christ say to the humble shepherds, Behold, I bring you glad tidings
          of great joy'; unto you that believe in Christ a Savior is born'. And
          well may angels rejoice at the conversion of poor sinners; for the
          Lord is their righteousness; they have peace with God through faith in
          Christ's blood, and shall never enter into condemnation. O believers!
          (for this discourse is intended in a special manner for you) lift up
          your heads; rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice'. Christ
          is mad to you, of God, righteousness, what then should you fear? You
          are made the righteousness of God in him; you may be called, The Lord
          our righteousness'. Of what then should you be afraid? What shall
          separate you henceforward from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
          or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
          sword? No, I am persuaded, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
          principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
          nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
          separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord',
          who of God is made unto you righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a glorious privilege, but this is only the beginning of the
          happiness of believers: For,
        </p>
        <p>
          3: Thirdly, Christ is not only made to them righteousness, but
          sanctification; by sanctification, I do not mean a bare hypocritical
          attendance on outward ordinances, though rightly informed Christians
          will think it their duty and privilege constantly to attend on all
          outward ordinances. Nor do I mean by sanctification a bare outward
          reformation, and a few transient convictions, or a little legal
          sorrow; for all this an unsanctified man may have; but, by
          sanctification I mean a total renovation of the whole man: by the
          righteousness of Christ, believers come legally, by sanctification
          they are made spiritually, alive; by the one they are entitled to, by
          the other they are made meet for, glory. They are sanctified,
          therefore, throughout, in spirit, soul, and body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their understandings, which were dark before, now become light in the
          Lord; and their wills, before contrary to, now become one with the
          will of God; their affections are now set on things above; their
          memory is now filled with divine things; their natural consciences are
          now enlightened; their members, which were before instruments of
          uncleanness, and of iniquity into iniquity, are now new creatures; old
          things are passed away, all things are become new', in their hearts:
          sin has now no longer dominion over them; they are freed from the
          power, though not the indwelling of being, of it; they are holy both
          in heart and life, in all manner of conversation: they are made
          partakers of a divine nature, and from Jesus Christ, they receive
          grace; and every grace that is in Christ, is copied and transcribed
          into their souls; they are transformed into his likeness; he is formed
          within them; they dwell in him, and he in them; they are led by the
          Spirit, and bring forth the fruits thereof; they know that Chris is
          their Emmanuel, God with and in them; they are living temples of the
          Holy Ghost. And therefore, being a holy habitation unto the Lord, the
          whole Trinity dwells and walks in them; even here, they sit together
          with Christ in heavenly places, and are vitally united to him, their
          Head, by a living faith; their Redeemer, their Maker, is their
          husband; they are flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone; they talk,
          they walk with him, as a man talketh and walketh with his friend; in
          short, they are one with Christ, even as Jesus Christ and the Father
          are one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus is Christ made to believers sanctification. And O what a
          privilege is this! to be changed from beasts into saints, and from a
          devilish, to be made partakers of a divine nature; to be translated
          from the kingdom of Satan, into the kingdom of God's dear Son! To put
          off the old man, which is corrupt, and to put on the new man, which is
          created after God, in righteousness and true holiness! O what an
          unspeakable blessing is this! I almost stand amazed at the
          contemplation thereof. Well might the apostle exhort believers to
          rejoice in the Lord; indeed they have reason always to rejoice, yea,
          to rejoice on a dying bed; for the kingdom of God is in them; they are
          changed from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord: well may
          this be a mystery to the natural, for it is a mystery even to the
          spiritual man himself, a mystery which he cannot fathom. Does it not
          often dazzle your eyes, O ye children of God, to look at your own
          brightness, when the candle of the Lord shines out, and your redeemer
          lifts up the light of his blessed countenance upon your souls? Are not
          you astonished, when you feel the love of God shed abroad in your
          hearts by the Holy Ghost, and God holds out the golden scepter of his
          mercy, and bids you ask what you will, and it shall be given you? Does
          not that peace of God, which keeps and rules your hearts, surpass the
          utmost limits of your understandings? And is not the joy you feel
          unspeakable? Is it not full of glory? I am persuaded it is; and in
          your secret communion, when the Lord's love flows in upon your souls,
          you are as it were swallowed up in, or, to use the apostle's phrase,
          filled with all the fullness of God'. Are not you ready to cry out
          with Solomon, And will the Lord, indeed, dwell thus with men!' How is
          it that we should be thus thy sons and daughters, O Lord God Almighty!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are children of God, and know what it is to have fellowship
          with the Father and the Son; if you walk by faith, and not by sight; I
          am assured this is frequently the language of your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But look forward, and see an unbounded prospect of eternal happiness
          lying before thee, O believer! what thou hast already received are
          only the first-fruits, like the cluster of grapes brought out of the
          land of Canaan; only an earnest and pledge of yet infinitely better
          things to come: the harvest is to follow; thy grace is hereafter to be
          swallowed up in glory. Thy great Joshua, and merciful High-Priest,
          shall administer an abundant entrance to thee into the land of
          promise, that rest which awaits the children of God: for Christ is not
          only made to believers wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, but
          also redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, before we enter upon the explanation and contemplation of this
          privilege,
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, Learn hence the great mistake of those writers and clergy,
          who, notwithstanding they talk of sanctification and inward holiness,
          (as indeed sometimes they do, though in a very loose and superficial
          manner,) yet they generally make it the cause, whereas they should
          consider it as the effect, of our justification. 'Of him are ye in
          Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, righteousness, (and
          then) sanctification.' For Christ's righteousness, or that which
          Christ has done in our stead without us, is the sole cause of our
          acceptance in the sight of God, and of all holiness wrought in us: to
          this, and not to the light within, or any thing wrought within, should
          poor sinners seek for justification in the sight of God: for the sake
          of Christ's righteousness alone, and not any thing wrought in us, does
          God look favorably upon us; our sanctification at best, in this life,
          is not complete: though we be delivered from the power, we are not
          freed from the in-being of sin; but not only the dominion, but the
          in-being of sin, is forbidden, by the perfect law of God: for it is
          not said, thou shalt not give way to lust, but 'thou shalt not lust'.
          So that whilst the principle of lust remains in the least degree in
          our hearts, though we are otherwise never so holy, yet we cannot, on
          account of that, hope for acceptance with God. We must first,
          therefore, look for a righteousness without us, even the righteousness
          of our Lord Jesus Christ: for this reason the apostle mentions it, and
          puts it before sanctification, in the words of the text. And whosoever
          teacheth any other doctrine, doth not preach the truth as it is in
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, From hence also, the Antinomians and formal hypocrites may
          be confuted, who talk of Christ without, but know nothing,
          experimentally, of a work of sanctification wrought within them.
          Whatever they may pretend to, since Christ is not in them, the Lord is
          not their righteousness, and they have no well-grounded hope of glory:
          for though sanctification is not the cause, yet it is the effect of
          our acceptance with God; 'Who of God is made unto us righteousness and
          sanctification'. He, therefore, that is really in Christ, is a new
          creature; it is not going back to a covenant of works, to look into
          our hearts, and, seeing that they are changed and renewed, from thence
          form a comfortable and well grounded assurance of the safety of our
          states: no, but this I what we are directed to in scripture; by our
          bringing forth the fruits, we are to judge whether or no we ever did
          truly partake of the Spirit of God. 'We know (says John) that we are
          passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.' And
          however we may talk of Christ's righteousness, and exclaim against
          legal preachers, yet, if we be not holy in heart and life, if we be
          not sanctified and renewed by the Spirit in our minds, we are
          self-deceivers, we are only formal hypocrites: for we must not put
          asunder what God has joined together; we must keep the medium between
          the two extremes; not insist so much on the one hand upon Christ
          without, as to exclude Christ within, as an evidence of our being his,
          and as a preparation for future happiness; nor, on the other hand, so
          depend on inherent righteousness or holiness wrought in us, as to
          exclude the righteousness of Jesus Christ without us. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4: Fourthly, Let us now go on, and take a view of the other link, or
          rather the end, of the believer's golden chain or privileges,
          redemption. But we must look very high; for the top of it, like
          Jacob's ladder, reaches heaven, where all believers will ascend, and
          be placed at the right hand of God. 'Who of God is made unto us,
          wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a golden chain indeed! and, what is best of all, not one link
          can ever be broken asunder from another. Was there no other text in
          the book of God, this single one sufficiently proves the final
          perseverance of true believers: or never did God yet justify a man,
          whom he did not sanctify; nor sanctify one, whom he did not completely
          redeem and glorify: no! as for God, his way, his works, is perfect; he
          always carried on and finished the work he begun; thus it was in the
          first, so it is in the new creation; when God says, 'Let there be
          light', there is light, that shines more and more unto the perfect
          day, when believers enter into their eternal rest, as God entered into
          his. Those whom God has justified, he has in effect glorified: for as
          a man's worthiness was not the cause of God's giving him Christ's
          righteousness; so neither shall his unworthiness be a cause of his
          taking it away; God's gifts and callings are without repentance: and I
          cannot think they are clear in the notion of Christ's righteousness,
          who deny the final perseverance of the saints; I fear they understand
          justification in that low sense, which I understood it in a few years
          ago, as implying no more than remission of sins: but it not only
          signifies remission of sins past, but also a federal right to all good
          things to come. If God has given us his only Son, how shall he not
          with him freely give us all things? Therefore, the apostle, after he
          says, 'Who of God is made unto us righteousness', does not say,
          perhaps he may be made to us sanctification and redemption: but, 'he
          is made': for there is an eternal, indissoluble connection between
          these blessed privileges. As the obedience of Christ is imputed to
          believers, so his perseverance in that obedience is to be imputed to
          them also; and it argues great ignorance of the covenant of grace and
          redemption, to object against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the word redemption, we are to understand, not only a complete
          deliverance from all evil, but also a full enjoyment of all good both
          in body and soul: I say, both in body and soul; for the Lord is also
          for the body; the bodies of the saints in this life are temples of the
          Holy Ghost; God makes a covenant with the dust of believers; after
          death, though worms destroy them, yet, even in their flesh shall they
          see God. I fear, indeed, there are some Sadducees in our days, or at
          least heretics, who say, either, that there is no resurrection of the
          body, or that the resurrection is past already, namely, in our
          regeneration: Hence it is, that our Lord's coming in the flesh, at the
          day of judgment, is denied; and consequently, we must throw aside the
          sacrament of the Lord's supper. For why should we remember the Lord's
          death until he come to judgment, when he is already come to judge our
          hearts, and will not come a second time? But all this is only the
          reasoning of unlearned, unstable men, who certainly know not what they
          say, nor whereof they affirm. That we must follow our Lord in the
          regeneration, be partakers of a new birth, and that Christ must come
          into our hearts, we freely confess; and we hope, when speaking of
          these things, we speak no more than what we know and feel: but then it
          is plain, that Jesus Christ will come, hereafter, to judgment, and
          that he ascended into heaven with the body which he had here on earth;
          for says he, after his resurrection, 'Handle me, and see; a spirit has
          not flesh and bones, as you see me have'. And it is plain, that
          Christ's resurrection was an earnest of ours: for says the apostle,
          'Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them
          that sleep; and as in Adam all die, and are subject to mortality; so
          all that are in Christ, the second Adam, who represented believers as
          their federal head, shall certainly be made alive, or rise again with
          their bodies at the last day'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then, O believers! is one, though the lowest, degree of that
          redemption which you are to be partakers of hereafter; I mean, the
          redemption of your bodies: for this corruptible must put on
          incorruption, this mortal must put on immortality. Your bodies, as
          well as souls, were given to Jesus Christ by the Father; they have
          been companions in watching, and fasting, and praying: your bodies,
          therefore, as well as souls, shall Jesus Christ raise up at the last
          day. Fear not, therefore, O believers, to look into the grave: for to
          you it is not other than a consecrated dormitory, where your bodies
          shall sleep quietly until the morning of the resurrection; when the
          voice of the archangel shall sound, and the trump of God given the
          general alarm, 'Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment'; earth, air,
          fire, water, shall give up your scattered atoms, and both in body and
          soul shall you be ever with the Lord. I doubt not, but many of you are
          groaning under crazy bodies, and complain often that the mortal body
          weighs down the immortal soul; at least this is my case; but let us
          have a little patience, and we shall be delivered from our earthly
          prisons; ere long, these tabernacles of clay shall be dissolved, and
          we shall be clothed with our house which is from heaven; hereafter,
          our bodies shall be spiritualized, and shall be so far from hindering
          our souls through weakness, that they shall become string; so strong,
          as to bear up under an exceeding and eternal weight of glory; others
          again may have deformed bodies, emaciated also with sickness, and worn
          out with labor at age; but wait a little, until your blessed change by
          death comes; then your bodies shall be renewed and made glorious, like
          unto Christ's glorious body: of which we may form some faint idea,
          from the account given us of our Lord's transfiguration on the mount,
          when it is said, 'His raiment became bright and glistening, and his
          face brighter than the sun'. Well then may a believer break out in the
          apostle's triumphant language, 'O death, where is thy sting! O grave,
          where is thy victory!'
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the redemption of the body, in comparison of the
          redemption of the better part, our souls? I must, therefore say to you
          believers, as the angel said to John, 'Come up higher'; and let us
          take as clear a view as we can, at such a distance, of the redemption
          Christ has purchased for, and will shortly put you in actual
          possession of. Already you are justified, already you are sanctified,
          and thereby freed from the guilt and dominion of sin: but, as I have
          observed, the being and indwelling of sin yet remains in you; God sees
          it proper to leave some Amalekites in the land, to keep his Israel in
          action. The most perfect Christian, I am persuaded, must agree,
          according to one of our Articles, 'That the corruption of nature
          remains even in the regenerate; that the flesh lusteth always against
          the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh'. So that believers
          cannot do things for God with that perfection they desire; this
          grieves their righteous souls day by day, and, with the holy apostle,
          makes them cry out, 'Who shall deliver us from the body of this
          death!' I thank God, our Lord Jesus Christ will, but not completely
          before the day of our dissolution; they will the very being of sin be
          destroyed, and an eternal stop put to inbred, indwelling corruption.
          And is not this a great redemption? I am sure believers esteem it o:
          for there is nothing grieves the heart of a child of God so much, as
          the remains of indwelling sin. Again, believers are often in heaviness
          through manifold temptations; God sees that it is needful and good for
          them so to be; and though they may be highly favored, and wrapt up in
          communion with God, even to the third heavens; yet a messenger of
          Satan is often sent to buffet them, lest they should be puffed up with
          the abundance of revelations. But be not weary, be not faint in your
          minds: the time of your complete redemption draweth nigh. In heaven
          the wicked one shall cease from troubling you, and your weary souls
          shall enjoy an everlasting rest; his fiery darts cannot reach those
          blissful regions: Satan will never come any more to appear with,
          disturb, or accuse the sons of God, when once the Lord Jesus Christ
          shuts the door. Your righteous souls are now grieved, day by day, at
          the ungodly conversation of the wicked; tares now grow up among the
          wheat; wolves come in sheep's clothing: but the redemption spoken of
          in the text, will free your souls from all anxiety on these accounts;
          hereafter you shall enjoy a perfect communion of saints; nothing that
          is unholy or unsanctified shall enter into the holy of holies, which
          is prepared for you above: this, and all manner of evil whatsoever,
          you shall be delivered from, when your redemption is hereafter made
          complete in heaven; not only so, but you shall enter into the full
          enjoyment of all good. It is true, all saints will not have the same
          degree of happiness, but all will be as happy as their hearts can
          desire. Believers, you shall judge the evil, and familiarly converse
          with good, angels: you shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
          all the spirits of just men made perfect; and, to sum up all your
          happiness in one word, you shall see God the Father, Son, and Holy
          Ghost; and, by seeing God, be more and more like unto him, and pass
          from glory to glory, even to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must stop the glories of the upper world crowd in so fast upon
          my soul, that I am lost in the contemplation of them. Brethren, the
          redemption spoken of is unutterable; we cannot here find it out; eye
          hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the hearts of
          the most holy men living to conceive, how great it is. Were I to
          entertain you whole ages with an account of it, when you come to
          heaven, you must say, with the queen of Sheba, 'Not half, no, not one
          thousandth part was told us'. All we can do here, is to go upon mount
          Pisgah, and, by the eye of faith, take a distant view of the promised
          land: we may see it, as Abraham did Christ, afar off, and rejoice in
          it; but here we only know in part. Blessed be God, there is a time
          coming, when we shall know God, even as we are known, and God be all
          in all. Lord Jesus, accomplish the number of thine elect! Lord Jesus,
          hasten thy kingdom!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, where are the scoffers of these last days, who count the
          lives of Christians to be madness, and their end to be without honor?
          Unhappy men! you know not what you do. Were your eyes open, and had
          you senses to discern spiritual things, you would not speak all manner
          of evil against the children of God, but you would esteem them as the
          excellent ones of the earth, and envy their happiness: your souls
          would hunger and thirst after it: you also would become fools for
          Christ's sake. You boast of wisdom; so did the philosophers of
          Corinth: but your wisdom is the foolishness of folly in the sight of
          God. What will your wisdom avail you, if it does not make you wise
          unto salvation? Can you, with all your wisdom, propose a more
          consistent scheme to build you hopes of salvation on, than what has
          been now laid before you? Can you, with all the strength of natural
          reason, find out a better way of acceptance with God, than by the
          righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ? Is it right to think your own
          works can in any measure deserve or procure it? If not, why will you
          not believe in him? Why will you not submit to his righteousness? Can
          you deny that you are fallen creatures? Do not you find that you are
          full of disorders, and that these disorders make you unhappy? Do not
          you find that you cannot change your own hearts? Have you not resolved
          many and many a time, and have not your corruptions yet dominion over
          you? Are you not bondslaves to your lusts, and led captive by the
          devil at his will? Why then will you not come to Christ for
          sanctification? Do you not desire to die the death of the righteous,
          and that your future state may be like theirs; I am persuaded you
          cannot bear the thoughts of being annihilated, much less of being
          miserable for ever. Whatever you may pretend, if you speak truth, you
          must confess, that conscience breaks in upon you in more sober
          intervals whether you will or not, and even constrains you to believe
          that hell is no painted fire. And why then will you not come to
          Christ? He alone can procure you everlasting redemption. Haste, haste
          away to him, poor beguiled sinners. You lack wisdom; ask it of Christ.
          Who knows but he may give it you? He is able: for he is the wisdom of
          the Father; he is that wisdom which was from everlasting. You have no
          righteousness; away, therefore, to Christ: 'He is the end of the law
          for righteousness to every one that believeth.' You are unholy: flee
          to the Lord Jesus: He is full of grace and truth; ;and of his fullness
          all may receive that believe in him. You are afraid to die; let this
          drive you to Christ: he has the keys of death and hell: in him is
          plenteous redemption; he alone can open the door which leads to
          everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let not, therefore, the deceived reasoner boast any longer of his
          pretended reason. Whatever you may think, it is the most unreasonable
          thing in the world not to believe on Jesus Christ, whom God has sent.
          Why, why will you die? Why will you not come unto him, that you may
          have life? 'Ho! every one that thirsteth, come unto the waters of
          life, and drink freely: come, buy without money and without price.'
          Were these blessed privileges in the text to be purchased with money,
          you might say, we are poor, and cannot buy: or, were they to be
          conferred only on sinners of such a rank or degree, then you might
          say, how can such sinners as we, expect to be so highly favored? But
          they are to be freely given of God to the worst of sinners. 'To us',
          says the apostle, to me a persecutor, to you Corinthians, who were
          'unclean, drunkards, covetous persons, idolaters.' Therefore, each
          poor sinner may say then, why not unto me? Has Christ but one
          blessing? What if he has blessed millions already, by turning them
          away from their iniquities; yet he still continues the same: he lives
          for ever to make intercession, and therefore will bless you, even you
          also. Though, Esau- like, you have been profane, and hitherto despised
          your heavenly Father's birth-right; even now, if you believe, 'Christ
          will be made to you of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
          redemption'.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must turn again to believers, for whose instruction, as I
          observed before, this discourse was particularly intended. You see,
          brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, what great blessings are
          treasured up for you in Jesus Christ your Head, and what you are
          entitled to by believing on his name. Take heed, therefore, that ye
          walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Think often how
          highly you are favored; and remember, you have not chosen Christ, but
          Christ has chosen you. Put on (as the elect of God) humbleness of
          mind, and glory, but let it be only in the Lord; for you have nothing
          but what you have received of God. By nature ye were foolish, as
          legal, as unholy, and in as damnable a condition, as others. Be
          pitiful, therefore, be courteous; and, as sanctification is a
          progressive work, beware of thinking you have already attained. Let
          him that is holy be holy still; knowing, that he who is most pure in
          heart, shall hereafter enjoy the clearest vision of God. Let
          indwelling sin be your daily burden; and not only bewail and lament,
          but see that you subdue it daily by the power of divine grace; and
          look up to Jesus continually to be the finisher, as well as author, of
          your faith. Build not on your own faithfulness, but on God's
          unchangeableness. Take heed of thinking you stand by the power of your
          own free will. The everlasting love of God the Father, must be your
          only hope and consolation; let this support you under all trials.
          Remember that God's gifts and callings are without repentance; that
          Christ having once loved you, will love you to the end. Let this
          constrain you to obedience, and make you long and look for that
          blessed time, when he shall not only be your wisdom, and
          righteousness, and sanctification, but also complete and everlasting
          redemption.
        </p>
        <p>Glory be to God in the highest!<br /></p>
