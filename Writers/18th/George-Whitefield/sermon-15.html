        <p>Jeremiah 23:6 -- "The Lord our Righteousness."</p>
        <p>
          Whoever is acquainted with the nature of mankind in general, or the
          propensity of his own heart in particular, must acknowledge, that
          self- righteousness is the last idol that is rooted out of the heart:
          being once born under a covenant of works, it is natural for us all to
          have recourse to a covenant of works, for our everlasting salvation.
          And we have contracted such devilish pride, by our fall from God, that
          we would, if not wholly, yet in part at least, glory in being the
          cause of our own salvation. We cry out against popery, and that very
          justly; but we are all Papists, at least, I am sure, we are all
          Arminians by nature; and therefore no wonder so many natural men
          embrace that scheme. It is true, we disclaim the doctrine of merit,
          are ashamed directly to say we deserve any good at the hands of God;
          therefore, as the Apostle excellently well observes, "we go about," we
          fetch a circuit, "to establish a righteousness of our own, and," like
          the Pharisees of old, "will not wholly submit to that righteousness
          which is of God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the sorest, though, alas! the most common evil that was ever
          yet seen under the sun. An evil, that in any age, especially in these
          dregs of time wherein we live, cannot sufficiently be inveighed
          against. For as it is with the people, so it is with the priests; and
          it is to be feared, even in those places, where once the truth as it
          is in Jesus was eminently preached, many ministers are so sadly
          degenerated from their pious ancestors, that the doctrines of grace,
          especially the personal, All-Sufficient Righteousness of Jesus, is but
          too seldom, too slightly mentioned. Hence the love of many waxeth
          cold; and I have often thought, was it possible, that this single
          consideration would be sufficient to raise our venerable forefathers
          again from their graves; who would thunder in their ears their fatal
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          The righteousness of Jesus Christ is one of those great mysteries,
          which the angels desire to look into, and seems to be one of the first
          lessons that God taught men after the fall. For, what were the coats
          that God made to put on our first parents, but types of the
          application of the merits of righteousness of Jesus Christ to
          believers hearts? We are told, that those coats were made of skins of
          beasts; and, as beasts were not then food for men, we may fairly
          infer, that those beasts were slain in sacrifice, in commemoration of
          the great sacrifice, Jesus Christ, thereafter to be offered. And the
          skins of the beasts thus slain, being put on Adam and Eve, they were
          hereby taught how their nakedness was to be covered with the
          righteousness of the Lamb of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is it which is meant, when we are told, "Abraham believed on the
          Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteousness." In short, this
          is it of which both the law and the prophets have spoken, especially
          Jeremiah in the words of the text, "The Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>I propose, through divine grace,</p>
        <p>I. To consider who we are to understand by the word Lord.</p>
        <p>II. How the Lord is man's righteousness.</p>
        <p>
          III. I will consider some of the chief objections that are generally
          urged against this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall show some very ill consequences that flow naturally from
          denying this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Shall conclude with an exhortation to all to come to Christ by
          faith, that they may be enabled to say with the prophet in the text,
          "The Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I am to consider who we are to understand by the word Lord. The
          Lord our righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any Arians of Socinians are drawn by curiosity to hear what the
          babbler has to say, let them be ashamed of denying the divinity of
          that Lord, who has bought poor sinners with his precious blood. For
          the person mentioned in the text, under the character of the Lord, is
          Jesus Christ. Ver.5, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
          will raise unto David a righteous branch, a king shall reign and
          prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his
          days (ver.6) Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and
          this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our
          righteousness." By the righteous branch, all agree, that we are to
          understand Jesus Christ. He it is that is called the Lord in our text.
          If so, if there were no other text in the Bible to prove the divinity
          of Christ, this is sufficient: for if the word Lord may properly
          belong to Jesus Christ, he must be God. And, as you have it in the
          margin of your Bibles, the word Lord is in the original Jehovah, which
          is the essential title of God himself. Come then, ye Arians, kiss the
          son of God, bow down before him, and honor him, even as ye honor the
          Father. Learn of the angels, those morning-stars, and worship him as
          truly God: for otherwise you are as much idolaters, as those that
          worship the Virgin Mary. And as for you Socinians, who say Christ was
          a mere man, and yet profess that he was your Savior, according to your
          own principles you are accursed: for, if Christ be a mere man, then he
          is only an arm of flesh: and it is written, "Cursed is he that
          trusteth on an arm of flesh." But I would hope, there are no such
          monsters here; at least, that, after these considerations, they would
          be ashamed of broaching such monstrous absurdities any more. For it is
          plain, that, by the word Lord, we are to understand the Lord Jesus
          Christ, who here takes to himself the title Jehovah, and therefore
          must be very God of very God; or, as the Apostle devoutly expresses
          it, "God blessed for evermore."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. How the Lord is to be man's righteousness, comes next to be
          considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that is, in one word, by Imputation. For it pleased God, after he
          had made all things by the word of his power, to create man after his
          own image. And so infinite was the condescension of the high and lofty
          One, who inhabiteth eternity, that, although he might have insisted on
          the everlasting obedience of him and his posterity; yet he was pleased
          to oblige himself, by a covenant or agreement made with his own
          creatures, upon condition of an unsinning obedience, to give them
          immortality and eternal life. For when it is said, "The day thou
          eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die;" we may fairly infer, so long
          as he continued obedient, and did not eat thereof, he should surely
          live. The 3rd of Genesis gives us a full, but mournful account, how
          our first parents broke this covenant, and thereby stood in need of a
          better righteousness than their own, in order to procure their future
          acceptance with God. For what must they do? They were as much under a
          covenant of works as ever. And though, after their disobedience, they
          were without strength; yet they were obliged not only to do, but
          continue to do all things, and that too in the most perfect manner,
          which the Lord had required of them: and not only so, but to make
          satisfaction to God's infinitely offended justice, for the breach they
          had already been guilty of. Here then opens the amazing scene of
          Divine Philanthropy; I mean, God's love to man. For behold, what man
          could not do, Jesus Christ, the son of his Father's love, undertakes
          to do for him. And that God might be just in justifying the ungodly,
          though "he was in the form of God, and therefore thought it no robbery
          to be equal with God; yet he took upon him the form of a servant,"
          even human nature. In that nature he obeyed, and thereby fulfilled the
          whole moral law in our stead; and also died a painful death upon the
          cross, and thereby became a curse for, or instead of, those whom the
          Father had given to him. As God, he satisfied, at the same time that
          he obeyed and suffered as man; and, being God and man in one person,
          he wrought out a full, perfect, and sufficient righteousness for all
          to whom it was to be imputed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then we see the meaning of the word righteousness. It implies the
          active as well as passive obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
          generally, when talking of the merits of Christ, only mention the
          latter, -- his death; whereas, the former, -- his life and active
          obedience, is equally necessary. Christ is not such a Savior as
          becomes us, unless we join both together. Christ not only died, but
          lived, not only suffered, but obeyed for, or instead of, poor sinners.
          And both these jointly make up that complete righteousness, which is
          to be imputed to us, as the disobedience of our first parents was made
          ours by imputation. In this sense, and no other, are we to understand
          that parallel which the apostle Paul draws, in the 5th of the Romans,
          between the first and second Adam. This is what he elsewhere terms,
          "our being made the righteousness of God in him." This is the sense
          wherein the Prophet would have us to understand the words of the text;
          therefore, Jer.33:16, "She (i.e. the church itself) shall be called,
          (having this righteousness imputed to her) The Lord our
          righteousness." A passage, I think, worthy of the profoundest
          meditation of all the sons and daughters of Abraham.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many are the objections which the proud hearts of fallen men are
          continually urging against this wholesome, this divine, this soul
          saving doctrine. I come now,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To answer some few of those which I think the most considerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, First, they say, because they would appear friends to morality,
          "That the doctrine of an imputed righteousness is "destructive of good
          works, and leads to licentiousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          And who, pray, are the persons that generally urge this objection? Are
          they men full of faith, and men really concerned for good works? No;
          whatever few exceptions there may be, if there be any at all, it is
          notorious, they are generally men of corrupt minds, reprobate
          concerning the faith. The best title I can give them is, that of
          profane moralists, or moralists false so called. For I appeal to the
          experience of the present as well as past ages, if iniquity did and
          does not most abound, where the doctrine of Christ's whole personal
          righteousness is most cried down, and most seldom mentioned. Arminian
          being antichristian principles, always did, and always will lead to
          antichristian practices. And never was there a reformation brought
          about in the church, but by the preaching the doctrine of an imputed
          righteousness. This, as the man of God, Luther, calls it, is
          "Artienlus statntis out cedentis Eichlesin," the article by which the
          Church stands or falls. And though the preachers of this doctrine are
          generally branded by those on the other side, with the opprobrious
          names of Antinomians, deceivers, and what not; yet, I believe, if the
          truth of the doctrine on both sides was to be judged of by the lives
          of the preachers of professors of it, on our side the question would
          have the advantage every way.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, this, as well as every other doctrine of grace, may be
          abused. And perhaps the unchristian walk of some, who have talked of
          Christ's imputed righteousness, justification by faith, and the like,
          and yet never felt it imputed to their own souls, has given the
          enemies of the Lord thus cause to blaspheme. But this is a very
          unsafe, as well as a very unfair way of arguing. The only question
          should be, Whether or not this doctrine of an imputed righteousness,
          does in itself cut off the occasion of good works, or lean to
          licentiousness? To this we may boldly answer, In no wise. It excludes
          works, indeed, from being any cause of our justification in the sight
          of God; but it requires good works as a proof of our having this
          righteousness imputed to us, and as a declarative evidence of our
          justification in the sight of men. And then, how can the doctrine of
          an imputed righteousness be a doctrine leading to licentiousness?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is all calumny. The apostle Paul introduceth an infidel making this
          objection, in his epistle to the Romans; and none but infidels, that
          never felt the power of Christ's resurrection upon their souls, will
          urge it over again. And therefore, notwithstanding this objection,
          with the Prophet in the text, we may boldly say, "The Lord is our
          righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But Satan (and no wonder that his servants imitate him) often
          transforms himself into an angel of light; and therefore, (such
          perverse things will infidelity and Arminianism make men speak) in
          order to dress their objections in the best colors, some urge, "That
          our Savior preached no such doctrine; that in his sermon on the mount,
          he mentions only morality:" and consequently the doctrine of an
          imputed righteousness falls wholly to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          But surely the men, who urge this objection, either never read, or
          never understood, our Lord's blessed discourse, wherein the doctrine
          of an imputed righteousness is so plainly taught, that he who runs, If
          he has eyes that see, may read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed our Lord does recommend morality and good works, (as all
          faithful ministers will do) and clears the moral law from many corrupt
          glosses put upon it by the letter-learned Pharisees. But then, before
          he comes to this, tis remarkable, he talks of inward piety, such as
          poverty of spirit, meekness, holy mourning, purity of heart,
          especially hungering and thirsting after righteousness; and then
          recommends good works, as an evidence of our having his righteousness
          imputed to us, and these graces and divine tempers wrought in our
          hearts. "Let your light (that is, the divine light I before have been
          mentioning) shine before men, in a holy life; that they, seeing your
          good works, may glorify your father which is in heaven." And then he
          immediately adds, "Think not that I am come to destroy the moral law:
          I came not to destroy, (to take away the force of it as a rule of
          life) but to fulfill, (to obey it in its whole latitude, and give the
          complete sense of it.") And then he goes on to show how exceeding
          broad the moral law is. So that our Lord, instead of setting aside an
          imputed righteousness in his sermon upon the mount, not only confirms
          it, but also answers the foregoing objection urged against it, by
          making good works a proof and evidence of its being imputed to our
          souls. He, therefore, that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the
          Prophet says in the words of the text, "The Lord our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But as Satan not only quoted scripture, but backed one temptation
          after another with it, when he attacked Christ in the wilderness; so
          his children generally take the same method in treating his doctrine.
          And, therefore, they urge another objection against the doctrine of an
          imputed righteousness, from the example of the young man in the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may state it thus: "The Evangelist Mark, say they, chapter 10,
          mentions a young man that came to Christ, running, and asking him what
          he should do to inherit eternal life? Christ referred him to the
          commandments, to know what he must do to inherit eternal life. It is
          plain, therefore, works were to be, partly at least, the cause of his
          justification; and consequently the doctrine of an imputed
          righteousness is unscriptural." This is the objection in its full
          strength: and little strength in all its fullness. For, was I to prove
          the necessity of an imputed righteousness, I scarce know how I could
          bring a better instance to make it good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us take a nearer view of this young man, and of our Lord's
          behavior towards him, Mark 10:17, the Evangelist tells us, "That when
          Christ was gone forth into the way, there came one running (it should
          seem it was some nobleman; a rarity indeed to see such a one running
          to Christ!) and not only so, but he kneeled to him, (perhaps many of
          his rank now, scarce know the time when they kneeled to Christ) and
          asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit
          eternal life?" Then Jesus, to see whether or not he believed him to be
          what he really was, truly and properly God, said unto him, "Why
          callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God." And,
          that he might directly answer his question, says he, "Thou knowest the
          commandments: do not commit adultery, do not bear false witness,
          defraud not, honor thy father and thy mother." This was a direct
          answer to his question; namely, That eternal life was not to be
          attained by his doings. For our Lord, by referring him to the
          commandments, did not (as the objectors insinuate) in the least hint,
          that his morality would recommend him to the favor and mercy of God;
          but he intended thereby, to make the law his schoolmaster to bring him
          to himself; that the young man, seeing how he had broken every one of
          these commandments, might thereby be convinced of the insufficiency of
          his own, and consequently of the absolute necessity of looking out for
          a better righteousness, whereon he might depend for eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was what our Lord designed. The young man being self-righteous,
          and willing to justify himself, said, "All these have I observed from
          my youth;" but had he known himself, he would have confessed, all
          these have I broken from my youth. For, supposing he had not actually
          committed adultery, had he never lusted after a woman in his heart?
          What, if he had not really killed another, had he never been angry
          without a cause, or spoken unadvisedly with his lips? If so, by
          breaking one of the least commandments in the least degree, he became
          liable to the curse of God: for "cursed is he (saith the law) that
          continueth not to do all things that are written in this book." And
          therefore, as observed before, our Lord was so far from speaking
          against, that he treated the young man in that manner, on purpose to
          convince him of the necessity of an imputed righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps they will reply, it is said, "Jesus beholding him, loved
          him." And what then? This he might do with a human love, and at the
          same time this young man have no interest in his blood. Thus Christ is
          said to wonder, to weep over Jerusalem, and say, "O that thou hadst
          known, Me." But such like passages are to be referred only to his
          human nature. And there is a great deal of difference between the love
          wherewith Christ loved this young man, and that wherewith he loved
          Mary, Lazarus, and their sister Martha. To illustrate this by
          comparison: A minister of the Lord Jesus Christ seeing many amiable
          dispositions, such as a readiness to hear the word, a decent behavior
          at public worship, and a life outwardly spotless in many, cannot but
          so far love them; but then there is much difference betwixt the love
          which a minister feels for such, and that divine love, that union and
          sympathy of soul, which he feels for those that he is satisfied are
          really born again of God. Apply this to our Lord's case, as a faint
          illustration of it. Consider what has been said upon the young man's
          case in general, and then, if before you were fond of this objection,
          instead of triumphing, like him you will go sorrowful away. Our
          Savior's reply to him more and more convinces us of the truth of the
          prophet's assertion in the text, that "the Lord is our righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is a fourth, and a grand objection yet behind, which is
          taken from the 25th chapter of Matthew, "where our Lord is described
          as rewarding people with eternal life, because they fed the hungry,
          clothed the naked, and such-like. Their works therefore were a cause
          of their justification, consequently the doctrine of imputed
          righteousness is not agreeable to scripture."
        </p>
        <p>
          This, I confess, is the most plausible objection that is brought
          against the doctrine insisted on from the text; and that we may answer
          it in as clear and brief a manner as may be, we confess, with the
          Article of the Church of England, "That albeit good works do not
          justify us, yet they will follow after justification, as fruits of it;
          and though they spring from faith in Christ, and a renewed soul, they
          shall receive a reward of grace, though not of debt; and consequently
          the more we abound in such good works, the greater will be our reward
          when Jesus Christ shall come to judgment."
        </p>
        <p>
          Take these consideration along with us, and they will help us much to
          answer the objection now before us. For thus saith Matthew, "Then
          shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed
          children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
          foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I
          was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me
          in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in
          prison, and ye came unto me. I will therefore reward you, because you
          have done these things out of love to me, and hereby have evidenced
          yourselves to be my true disciples." And that the people did not
          depend on these good actions for their justification in the sight of
          God, is evident. "For when saw we thee an hungered, say they, and fed
          thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger,
          and took thee in, or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee
          sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?" Language, and questions,
          quite improper for persons relying on their own righteousness, for
          acceptance and acquittance in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then they reply against thee: "In the latter part of the chapter,
          it is plain that Jesus Christ rejects and damns the others for not
          doing these things. And therefore, if he damns these for not doing, he
          saves those for doing; and consequently the doctrine of an imputed
          righteousness is good for nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
          But that is no consequence at all; for God may justly damn any man for
          omitting the least duty of the moral law, and yet in himself is not
          obliged to give to any one any reward, supposing he has done all that
          he can. We are unprofitable servants; we have not done near so much as
          it was our duty to do, must be the language of the most holy souls
          living; and therefore, from or in ourselves, cannot be justified in
          the sight of God. This was the frame of the devout souls just now
          referred to. Sensible of this, they were so far from depending on
          their works for justification in the sight of God, that they were
          filled, as it were, with a holy blushing, to think our Lord should
          condescend to mention, much more to reward them for, their poor works
          of faith and labors of love. I am persuaded their hearts would rise
          with a holy indignation against those who urge this passage, as an
          objection to the assertion of the prophet, that "the Lord is our
          righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, I think, we have fairly answered these grand objections, which
          are generally urged against the doctrine of an imputed righteousness.
          Was I to stop here, I think I may say, "We are made more than
          conquerors through him that loved us." But there is a way of arguing
          which I have always admired, because I have thought it always very
          convincing, by showing the absurdities that will follow from denying
          any particular proposition in dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This is the next thing that was proposed. And never did greater or
          more absurdities flow from the denying any doctrine, than will flow
          from denying the doctrine of Christ's imputed righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And First, if we deny this doctrine, we turn the truth, I mean the
          word of God, as much as we can, into a lie, and utterly subvert all
          those places of scripture which say that we are saved by grace; that
          it is not of works, lest any man should boast, that salvation is God's
          free gift, and that he who glorieth, must glory only in the Lord. For,
          if the whole personal righteousness of Jesus Christ be not the sole
          cause of my acceptance with God, if any work done by or foreseen in
          me, was in the least to be joined with it, or looked upon by God an in
          inducing, impulsive cause of acquitting my soul from guilt, then I
          have somewhat whereof I may glory in myself. Not boasting is excluded
          in the great work of our redemption; but that cannot be, if we are
          enemies to the doctrine of an imputed righteousness. It would be
          endless to enumerate how many texts of scripture must be false, if
          this doctrine be not true. Let it suffice to affirm in the general,
          that if we deny an imputed righteousness, we may as well deny a divine
          revelation all at once; for it is the alpha and omega, the beginning
          and the end of the book of God. We must either disbelieve that, or
          believe what the prophet has spoken in the text, "that the Lord is our
          righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          But further: I observed at the beginning of this discourse, that we
          are all Arminians and Papists by nature; for as one says, "Arminianism
          is the back way to popery." And here I venture further to affirming
          that if we deny the doctrine of an imputed righteousness, whatever we
          may stile ourselves, we are really Papists in our hearts; and deserve
          no other title from men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sirs, what think you? Suppose I was to come and tell you that you must
          intercede with saints, for them to intercede with God for you; would
          you not say, I was justly reputed a papist missionary by some, and
          deservedly thrust out of thy synagogues by others? I suppose you
          would. And why? Because, you would say, the intercession of Jesus
          Christ was sufficient of itself, without the intercession of saints,
          and that it was blasphemous to join theirs with his, as though he was
          sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose I went a little more round about, and told you that the death
          of Christ was not sufficient, without our death being added to it;
          that you must die as well as Christ, join your death with his, and
          then it would be sufficient. Might you not then, with a holy
          indignation, throw dust in the air, and justly call me a "setter forth
          of strange doctrines?" And how then, if it be not only absurd, but
          blasphemous to join the intercession of saints with the intercession
          of Christ, as though his intercession was not sufficient; or our death
          with the death of Christ, as though his death was not sufficient:
          judge ye, if it be not equally absurd, equally blasphemous, to join
          our obedience, either wholly or in part, with the obedience of Christ,
          as if that was not sufficient. And if so, what absurdities will follow
          the denying that the Lord, both as to his active and passive
          obedience, is our righteousness?
        </p>
        <p>
          One more absurdity I shall mention, as following the denying this
          doctrine, and I have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember a story of a certain prelate, who, after many arguments in
          vain urged to convince the Earl of Rochester of the invisible
          realities of another world, took his leave of his lordship with some
          such words as these: "Well, my lord, if there be no hell, I am safe;
          but if there should be such a thing as hell, what will become of you?"
          I apply this so those that oppose the doctrine now insisted on. If
          there be no such thing as the doctrine of an imputed righteousness,
          those who hold it, and bring forth fruit unto holiness, are safe; but
          if there be such a thing (as there certainly is) what will become of
          you that deny it? It is no difficult matter to determine. Your portion
          must be in the lake of fire and brimstone for ever and ever. Since you
          will rely upon your works, by your works you shall be judged. They
          shall be weighed in the balance of the sanctuary; and they will be
          found wanting. By your works therefore shall you be condemned; and
          you, being out of Christ, shall find God, to your poor wretched souls,
          a consuming fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great Stoddard or Northampton in New England, has therefore well
          entitled a book which he wrote (and which I would take this
          opportunity to recommend) "The Safety of appearing in the
          Righteousness of Christ." For why should I lean upon a broken reed,
          when I can have the rock of ages to stand upon, that never can be
          moved?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, before I come to a more particular application, give me
          leave, in the apostle's language, triumphantly to cry out, "Where is
          the scribe, where the disputer?" Where is the reasoning infidel of
          this generation? Can any thing appear more reasonable, even according
          to your own way of arguing, than the doctrine here laid down? Have you
          not felt a convincing power go along with the word? Why then will you
          not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that so he may become the Lord
          your righteousness?
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is time for me to come a little closer to your consciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, though some may be offended at this doctrine, and may
          account it foolishness; yet, to many of you, I doubt not but it is
          precious, it being agreeable to the form of sound words, which from
          your infancy has been delivered to you; and, coming from a quarter,
          you would least have expected, may be received with more pleasure and
          satisfaction. But give me leave to ask you one question; Can you say,
          the Lord our righteousness? I say, the Lord our righteousness. For
          entertaining this doctrine in your heads, without receiving the Lord
          Jesus Christ savingly by a lively faith into your hearts, will but
          increase your damnation. As I have often told you, so I tell you
          again, an unapplied Christ is no Christ at all. Can you then, with
          believing Thomas, cry our, "My Lord and my God?" Is Christ your
          sanctification, as well as your outward righteousness? For the word
          righteousness, in the text, not only implies Christ's personal
          righteousness imputed to us, but also holiness wrought in us. These
          two, God has joined together. He never did, he never dies, he never
          will put them asunder. If you are justified by the blood, you are also
          sanctified by the Spirit of our Lord. Can you then in this sense say,
          The Lord our righteousness? Were you ever made to abhor yourselves for
          your actual and original sins, and to loathe your own righteousness;
          for, as the prophet beautifully expresses it, "your righteousness is
          as filthy rags? Were you ever made to see and admire the
          all-sufficiency of Christ's righteousness, and excited by the Spirit
          of God to hunger and thirst after it? Could you ever say, my soul is
          athirst for Christ, yea, even for the righteousness of Christ? O when
          shall I come to appear before the presence of my God in the
          righteousness of Christ! Nothing but Christ! Nothing but Christ! Give
          me Christ, O god, and I am satisfied! My soul shall praise thee for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was this ever the language of your hearts? And, after these inward
          conflicts, were you ever enabled to reach out the arm of faith, and
          embrace the blessed Jesus in your souls, so that you could say, "my
          beloved is mine, and I am his?" If so, fear not, whoever you are.
          Hail, all hail, you happy souls! The Lord, the Lord Christ, the
          everlasting God, is your righteousness. Christ has justified you, who
          is he that condemneth you? Christ has died for you, nay rather is
          risen again, and ever liveth to make intercession for you. Being now
          justified by his grace, you have peace with God, and shall, ere long,
          be with Jesus in glory, reaping everlasting and unspeakable fruits
          both in body and soul. For there is no condemnation to those that are
          really in Christ Jesus. "Whether Paul or Apollos, or life or death,
          all is yours if you are Christ's, for Christ is God's. My brethren, my
          heart is enlarged towards you! O think of the love of Christ in dying
          for you! If the Lord be your righteousness, let the righteousness of
          your Lord be continually in your mouth. Talk of, O talk of, and
          recommend the righteousness of Christ, when you lie down, and when you
          rise up, at your going out and coming in! Think of the greatness of
          the gift, as well as the giver! Show to all the world, in whom you
          have believed! Let all by your fruits know, that the Lord is your
          righteousness, and that you are waiting for your Lord from heaven! O
          study to be holy, even as he who has called you, and washed you in his
          own blood, is holy! Let not the righteousness of the Lord be evil
          spoken of through you. Let not Jesus be wounded in the house of his
          friends, but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
          Savior Jesus Christ, day by day. O think of his dying love! Let that
          love constrain you to obedience! Having much forgiven, love much. Be
          always asking, What shall I do, to express my gratitude to the Lord,
          for giving me his righteousness? Let that self-abasing, God-exalting
          question be always in your mouths; "Why me, Lord? Why me?" why am I
          taken, and others left? Why is the Lord my righteousness? Why is he
          become my salvation, who have so often deserved damnation at his
          hands?
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends, I trust I feel somewhat of a sense of God's distinguishing
          love upon my heart; therefore I must divert a little from
          congratulating you, to invite poor Christless sinners to come to him,
          and accept of his righteousness, that they may have life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, my heart almost bleeds! What a multitude of precious souls are
          now before me! How shortly must all be ushered into eternity! And yet,
          O cutting thought! Was God now to require all your souls, how few,
          comparatively speaking, could really say, the Lord our righteousness!
        </p>
        <p>
          And think you, O sinner, that you will be able to stand in the day of
          judgment, if Christ be not your righteousness? No, that alone is the
          wedding garment in which you must appear. O Christless sinners, I am
          distressed for you! The desires of my soul are enlarged. O that this
          may be an accepted time! That the Lord may be your righteousness! For
          whither would you flee, if death should fine you naked? Indeed there
          is no hiding yourselves from his presence. The pitiful fig-leaves of
          your own righteousness will not cover your nakedness, when God shall
          call you to stand before him. Adam found them ineffectual, and so will
          you. O think of death! O think of judgment! Yet a little while, and
          time shall be no more; and then what will become of you, if the Lord
          be not your righteousness? Think you that Christ will spare you? No,
          he that formed you, will have no mercy on you. If you are not of
          Christ, if Christ be not your righteousness, Christ himself shall
          pronounce you damned. And can you bear to think of being damned by
          Christ? Can you bear to hear the Lord Jesus say to you, "Depart from
          me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
          angels." Can you live, think you, in everlasting burnings? Is your
          flesh brass, and your bones iron? What if they are? Hell-fire, that
          fire prepared for the devil and his angels, will heat them through and
          through. And can you bear to depart from Christ? O that heart-piercing
          thought! Ask those holy souls, who are at any time bewailing an absent
          God, who walk in darkness, and see no light, though but a few days or
          hours; ask them, what it is to lose a light and presence of Christ?
          See how they seek him sorrowing, and go mourning after him all the day
          long! And, if it is so dreadful to lose the sensible presence of
          Christ only for a day, what must it be to be banished from him to all
          eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          But thus it must be, if Christ be not your righteousness. For God's
          justice must be satisfied; and, unless Christ's righteousness is
          imputed and applied to you here, you must hereafter be satisfying the
          divine justice in hell-torments eternally; nay, Christ himself shall
          condemn you to that place of torment. And how cutting is that thought!
          Methinks I see poor, trembling, Christless wretches, standing before
          the bar of god, crying out, Lord, if we must be damned, let some
          angel, or some archangel, pronounce the damnatory sentence: but all in
          vain. Christ himself shall pronounce the irrevocable sentence. Knowing
          therefore the terrors of the Lord, let me persuade you to close with
          Christ, and never rest till you can say, "the Lord our righteousness."
          Who knows but the Lord may have mercy on, may, abundantly pardon you?
          Beg of God to give you faith; and, if the Lord gives you that, you
          will by it receive Christ, with his righteousness, and his All. You
          need not fear the greatness or number of your sins. For are you
          sinners? So am I. Are you the chief of sinners? So am I. Are you
          backsliding sinners? So am I. And yet the Lord (for ever adored be his
          rich, free and sovereign grace) the Lord is my righteousness. Come
          then, O young man, who (as I acted once myself) are playing the
          prodigal, and wandering away afar off from your heavenly Father's
          house, come home, come home, and leave your swines trough. Feed no
          longer on the husks of sensual delights: for Christ's sake arise, and
          come home! Your heavenly Father now calls you. See yonder the best
          robe, even the righteousness of his dear Son, awaits you. See it, view
          it again and again. Consider at how dear a rate it was purchased, even
          by the blood of God. Consider what great need you have of it. You are
          lost, undone, damned for ever, without it. Come then, poor, guilty
          prodigals, come home: indeed, I will not, like the elder brother in
          the gospel, be angry; no, I will rejoice with the angels in heaven.
          And O that God would now bow the heavens, and come down! Descend, O
          Son of God, descend; and, as thou hast shown in me such mercy, O let
          thy blessed Spirit apply thy righteousness to some young prodigals now
          before thee, and clothe their naked souls with thy best robe!
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must speak a word to you, young maidens, as well as young men. I
          see many of you adorned, as to your bodies, but are not your souls
          naked? Which of you can say, the Lord is my righteousness? Which of
          you was ever solicitous to be dressed in this robe of invaluable
          price, and without which you are no better than whited sepulchers in
          the sight of God? Let not then so many of you, young maidens, any
          longer forget your chief and only ornament. O seek for the Lord to be
          your righteousness, or otherwise burning will soon be upon you,
          instead of beauty!
        </p>
        <p>
          And what shall I say to you of a middle age, you busy merchants, you
          cumbered Martha's, who, with all your gettings, have not yet gotten
          the Lord to be your righteousness? Alas! what profit will there be of
          all your labor under the sun, if you do not secure this pearl of
          invaluable price? This one thing, so absolutely needful, that it only
          can stand you in stead, when all other things shall be taken from you.
          Labor therefore no longer so anxiously for the meat which perisheth,
          but henceforward seek for the Lord to be your righteousness, a
          righteousness that will entitle you to life everlasting. I see also
          many hoary heads here, and perhaps the most of them cannot say, the
          Lord is my righteousness. O gray-headed sinner, I could weep over you!
          Your gray hairs, which ought to be your crown, and in which perhaps
          you glory, are now your shame. You know not that the Lord is your
          righteousness: O haste then, haste ye, aged sinners, and seek an
          interest in redeeming love! Alas, you have one foot already in the
          grave, your glass is just run out, your sun is just going down, and it
          will set and leave you in an eternal darkness, unless the Lord be your
          righteousness! Flee then, O flee for your lives! Be not afraid. All
          things are possible with God. If you come, though it be at the
          eleventh hour, Christ Jesus will in no wise cast you out. Seek then
          for the Lord to be your righteousness, and beseech him to let you
          know, how it is that a man may be born again when he is old! But I
          must not forget the lambs of the flock. To feed them was one of my
          Lord's last commands. I know he will be angry with me, if I do not
          tell them, that the Lord may be their righteousness; and that of such
          is the kingdom of heaven. Come then, ye little children, come to
          Christ; the Lord Christ shall be your righteousness. Do not think,
          that you are too young to be converted. Perhaps many of you may be
          nine or ten years old, and yet cannot say, the Lord is our
          righteousness: which many have said, though younger than you. Come
          then, while you are young. Perhaps you may not live to be old. Do not
          stay for other people. If your fathers and mothers will not come to
          Christ, do you come without them. Let children lead them, and show
          them how the Lord may be their righteousness. Our Lord Jesus Christ
          loved little children. You are his lambs; he bids me feed you. I pray
          God make you willing betimes to take the Lord for your righteousness.

          Here then I could conclude; but I must not forget the poor negroes;
          no, I must not. Jesus Christ had died for them, as well as for others.
          Nor do I mention you last, because I despise your souls; but because I
          would have what I shall say, make the deeper impression upon your
          hearts. O that you would seek the Lord to be your righteousness! Who
          knows but he may be found of you? For in Jesus Christ there is neither
          male nor female, bond nor free; even you may be the children of God,
          if you believe in Jesus. Did you never read of the eunuch belonging to
          the queen of Candace? A negro like yourselves. He believed. The Lord
          was his righteousness. He was baptized. Do you also believe, and you
          shall be saved. Christ Jesus is the same now as he was yesterday, and
          will wash you in his own blood. Go home then, turn the words of the
          text into a prayer, and entreat the Lord to be your righteousness.
          Even so, come Lord Jesus, come quickly, into all our souls! Amen, Lord
          Jesus, Amen and Amen!<br />
