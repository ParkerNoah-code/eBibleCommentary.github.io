          Numberless marks does man bear in his soul, that he is fallen and
          estranged from God; but nothing gives a greater proof thereof, than
          that backwardness, which every one finds within himself, to the duty
          of praise and thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          When God placed the first man in paradise, his soul no doubt was so
          filled with a sense of the riches of the divine love, that he was
          continually employing that breath of life, which the Almighty had not
          long before breathed into him, in blessing and magnifying that
          all-bountiful, all gracious God, in whom he lived, moved, and had his
          being.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the brightest idea we can form of the angelical hierarchy above,
          and the spirits of just men made perfect, is, that they are
          continually standing round the throne of God, and cease not day and
          night, saying, "Worthy art thou, O Lamb that wast slain, to receive
          power and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and
          blessing." Rev.5:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          That then, which was man's perfection when time first began, and will
          be his employment when death is swallowed up in victory, and time
          shall be no more, without controversy, is part of our perfection, and
          ought to be our frequent exercise on earth: and I doubt not but those
          blessed spirits, who are sent forth to minister to them who shall be
          heirs of salvation, often stand astonished when they encamp around us,
          or find our hearts so rarely enlarged, and our mouths so seldom
          opened, to show forth the loving- kindness of the Lord, or to speak of
          all his praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matter for praise and adoration, can never be wanting to creatures
          redeemed by the blood of the Son of God; and who have such continual
          scenes of his infinite goodness presented to their view, that were
          their souls duly affected with a sense of his universal love, they
          could not but be continually calling on heaven and earth, men and
          angels, to join with them in praising and blessing that "high and
          lofty one, who inhabiteth eternity, who maketh his sun to shine on the
          evil and on the good," and daily pours down his blessings on the whole
          race of mankind.,
        </p>
        <p>
          But few are arrived to such a degree of charity or love, as to rejoice
          with those that do rejoice, and to be as thankful for other mercies,
          as their own. This part of Christian perfection, though begun on
          earth, will be consummated only in heaven; where our hearts will glow
          with such fervent love towards God and one another, that every fresh
          degree of glory communicated to our neighbor, will also communicate to
          us a fresh topic of thankfulness and joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which has the greatest tendency to excite the generality of
          fallen men to praise and thanksgiving, is a sense of God's private
          mercies, and particular benefits bestowed upon ourselves. For as these
          come nearer our own hearts, so they must be more affecting: and as
          they are peculiar proofs, whereby we may know, that God does in a more
          especial manner favor us above others, so they cannot but sensibly
          touch us; and if our hearts are not quite frozen, like coals of a
          refiner's fire, they must melt us down into thankfulness and love. It
          was a consideration of the distinguishing favor God had shown to his
          chosen people Israel, and the frequent and remarkable deliverance
          wrought by him in behalf of "hose who go down to the Sea in ships, and
          occupy their business in great matters," that made the holy Psalmist
          break out so frequently as he does in this psalm, into this moving,
          pathetical exclamation, "that men would therefore praise the Lord for
          his goodness, and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children
          of men!"
        </p>
        <p>
          His expressing himself in so fervent a manner, implies both the
          importance and neglect of the duty. As when Moses in another occasion
          cried out, "O that they were wise, that they understood this, that
          they would practically consider their latter end!" Deut.32:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say, importance and neglect of the duty; for out of those man
          thousands that receive blessings from the Lord, how few give thanks in
          remembrance of his holiness? The account given us of the ungrateful
          lepers, is but too lively a representation of the ingratitude of
          mankind in general; who like them, when under any humbling providence,
          can cry, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!" Luke 17:13. But when
          healed of their sickness, or delivered from their distress, scarce one
          in ten can be found "returning to give thanks to God."
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet as common as this sin of ingratitude is, there is nothing we
          ought more earnestly to pray against. For what is more absolutely
          condemned in holy scripture than ingratitude? Or what more
          peremptorily (absolutely, emphatically) required than the contrary
          temper? Thus says the Apostle, "Rejoice evermore; in every thing give
          thanks," 1 Thes.5:16, 18. "Be careful for nothing; but in every thing
          by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be
          made known unto God," Phil.4:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the contrary, the Apostle mentions it as one of the highest crimes
          of the Gentiles, that they were not thankful. "Neither were they
          thankful," Rom.1:21. As also in another place, he numbers the
          "unthankful," 2 Tim.3:2 amongst those unholy, profane person, who are
          to have their portion in the lake of fire and brimstone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for our sins, God puts them behind his back; but his mercies he
          will have acknowledged, "There is virtue gone out of me," says Jesus
          Christ, Luke 8:46 and the woman who was cured of her bloody issue,
          must confess it. And we generally find, when God sent any remarkable
          punishment upon a particular person, he reminded him of the favors he
          had received, as so many aggravations of his ingratitude. Thus when
          God was about to visit Eli's house, he thus expostulates with him by
          his prophet: "Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy fathers, when
          they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house? And did I choose him out of
          all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar,
          to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before me? Wherefore kick ye at
          my sacrifice, and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my
          habitation, and honorest thy sons above me; so make yourselves fat
          with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? Wherefore
          the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed, that thy house, and the
          house of thy father, should walk before me for ever; but now the Lord
          saith, Be it far from me, for them that honor me will I honor, and
          they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed" 2 Sam.2:27-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this and such like instances of God's severity against the
          unthankful, that inclined me to choose the words of the text, as the
          most proper subject I could discourse on at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four months, my good friends, we have now been upon the sea in this
          ship, and "have occupied our business in the great waters." At God
          Almighty's word, we have seen "the stormy wind arise, which hath
          lifted up the waves thereof. We have been carried up to the heaven,
          and down again to the deep, and some of our souls melted away because
          of the trouble; but I trust we cried earnestly unto the Lord, and he
          delivered us out of our distress. For he made the storm to cease; so
          that the waves thereof were still. And now we are glad, because we are
          at rest, for God hath brought us to the haven where we would be. O
          that you would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare
          the wonders that he hath done for us, the unworthiest of the sons of
          men."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Moses, thus Joshua behaved. For when they were about to take
          their leave of the children of Israel, they recounted to them what
          great things God had done for them, as the best arguments and motives
          they could urge to engage them to obedience. And how can I copy after
          better examples? What fitter, what more noble motives, to holiness and
          purity of living, can I lay before you, than they did?
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, I cannot say, that we have seen the "pillar of a cloud by day,
          or a pillar of fire by night," going visibly before us to guide our
          course; but this I can say, that the same God who was in that pillar
          of a cloud, and pillar of fire, which departed not from the
          Israelites, and who has made the sun to rule the day, and the moon to
          rule the night, has, by his good providence, directed us in our right
          way, or else the pilot had steered us in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither can I say, That we have seen the "sun stand still," as the
          children of Israel did in the days of Joshua. But surely God, during
          part of our voyage, has caused it to withhold some of that heat, which
          it usually sends forth in these warmer climates, or else it had not
          failed, but some of you must have perished in the sickness that has
          been, and does yet continue among us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have not seen the waters stand purposely on an heap, that we might
          pass through, neither have we been pursued by Pharaoh and his host,
          and delivered out of their hands; but we have been led through the sea
          as through a wilderness, and were once remarkably preserved from being
          run down by another ship; which had God permitted, the waters, in all
          probability, would immediately have overwhelmed us, and like Pharaoh
          and his host, we should have sunk, as stones, into the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may, indeed, atheist like, ascribe all these things to natural
          causes, and say, "Our own skill and foresight has brought us hither in
          safety." But as certainly as Jesus Christ, the angel of the covenant,
          in the days of his flesh, walked upon the water, and said to his
          sinking disciples, "Be not afraid, it is I," so surely has the same
          everlasting I AM, "who decketh himself with light as with a garment,
          who spreadeth out the heavens like a curtain, who claspeth the winds
          in his fist, who holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hands," and
          guided the wise men by a star in the east; so surely, I say, has he
          spoken, and at his command the winds have blown us where we are not
          arrived. For his providence ruleth all things; "Wind and storms obey
          his word:" he saith to it at one time, Go, and it goeth; at another,
          Come, and it cometh; and at a third time, Blow this way, and it
          bloweth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is he, my brethren; and not we ourselves, that has of late sent us
          such prosperous gales, and made us to ride, as it were, on the wings
          of the wind, into the haven where we would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          "O that you would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness," and by
          your lives declare, that you are truly thankful for the wonders he had
          shown to us; who are less than the least of the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say, declare it by your lives. For to give him thanks, barely with
          your lips; while your hearts are far from him, is but a mock
          sacrifice, nay, an abomination unto the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the end, the royal Psalmist says, God had in view, when he
          showed such wonders, from time to time, to the people of Israel, "That
          they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws," Psalm 105:44 and
          this, my good friends, is the end God would have accomplished in us,
          and the only return he desires us to make him, for all the benefits he
          hath conferred upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          O then, let me beseech you, give to God your hearts, your whole
          hearts; and suffer yourselves to be drawn by the cords of infinite
          love, to honor and obey him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assure yourselves you can never serve a better master; for his service
          is perfect freedom, his yoke, when worn a little while, is exceeding
          easy, his burden light, and in keeping his commandments there is great
          reward; love, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost here, and a crown of glory
          that fadeth not away, hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may, indeed, let other lords have dominion over you, and Satan may
          promise to give you all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
          them, if you will fall down and worship him; but he is a liar, and was
          so from the beginning; he has not so much to give you, as you may
          tread on with the soul of your foot; or could he give you the whole
          world, yea, that could not make you happy without God. It is God
          alone, my brethren, whose we are, in whose name I now speak, and who
          has of late showed us such mercies in the deep, that can give solid
          lasting happiness to your souls; and he for this reason only desires
          your hearts, because without him you must be miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suffer me not then to go away without my errand; as it is the last
          time I shall speak to you, let me not speak in vain; but let a sense
          of the divine goodness lead you to repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Saul, that abandoned wretch, when David showed him his skirt,
          which he had cut off, when he might have also taken his life, was so
          melted down with his kindness, that he lifted up his voice and wept.
          And we must have hearts harder than Saul's, nay, harder than the
          nether millstone, if a sense of God's late loving kindnesses,
          notwithstanding he might so often have destroyed us, does not even
          compel us to lay down our arms against him, and become his faithful
          servants and soldiers unto our lives end.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they have not this effect upon us, we shall, of all men, be most
          miserable; for God is just, as well as merciful; and the more
          blessings we have received here, the greater damnation, if we do not
          improve them, shall we incur hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God forbid that any of those should ever suffer the vengeance of
          eternal fire, amongst whom, I have, for these four months, been
          preaching the gospel of Christ; but yet thus must it be, if you do not
          improve the divine mercies: and instead of your being my crown of
          rejoicing in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, I must appear as a
          swift witness against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that
          accompany salvation, though I thus speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed be God, some marks of a partial reformation at least, have
          been visible amongst all you that are soldiers. And my weak, though
          sincere endeavors, to build you up in the knowledge and fear of God,
          have not been altogether in vain in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Swearing, I hope is, in a great measure, abated with you; and God, I
          trust, has blessed his late visitations, by making them the means of
          awakening your consciences, to a more solicitous inquiry about the
          things which belong to your everlasting peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fulfill you then my joy, by continuing thus minded, and labor to go on
          to perfection. For I shall have no greater pleasure than to see, or
          hear, that you walk in the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, my good friends, you are now, as it were, entering on a new
          world, where you will be surrounded with multitudes of heathens; and
          if you take not heed to "have your conversation honest amongst them,"
          and to "walk worthy of the holy vocation wherewith you are called,"
          you will act the hellish part of Herod's soldiers over again; and
          cause Christ's religion, as they did his person, to be had in derision
          of those that are round about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider further, what peculiar privileges you have enjoyed, above
          many others that are entering on the same land. They have had, as it
          were, a famine of the word, but you have rather been in danger of
          being surfeited with your spiritual manna. And, therefore, as more
          instructions have been given you, so from you, men will most justly
          expect the greater improvement in goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, I cannot say, I have discharged my duty towards you as I
          ought. No, I am sensible of many faults in my ministerial office, and
          for which I have not failed, nor, I hope, ever shall fail, to humble
          myself in secret before God. However, this I can say, that except a
          few days that have been spent necessarily on other persons, whom God
          immediately called me to write and minister unto, and the two last
          weeks wherein I have been confined by sickness; all the while I have
          been aboard, I have been either actually engaged in, or preparing
          myself for instructing you. And though you are now to be committed to
          the care of another (whose labors I heartily beseech God to bless
          amongst you) yet I trust I shall, at all seasons, if need be,
          willingly spend, and be spent, for the good of your souls, though the
          more abundantly I love you, the less I should be loved.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for your military affairs, I have nothing to do with them. Fear
          God, and you must honor the King. Nor am I well acquainted with the
          nature of that land which you are now come over to protect; only this
          I may venture to affirm in the general, that you must necessarily
          expect upon your arrival at a new colony, to meet with many
          difficulties. But your very profession teaches you to endure hardship;
          "be not, therefore, faint- hearted, but quit yourselves like men, and
          be strong," Numb.14. Be not like those cowardly persons, who were
          affrighted at the report of the false spies, that came and said, that
          there were people tall as the Anakims to be grappled with, but be ye
          like unto Caleb and Joshua, all heart; and say, we will act valiantly,
          for we shall be more than conquerors over all difficulties through
          Jesus Christ that loved us. Above all things, my brethren, take heed,
          and beware of murmuring, like the perverse Israelites, against those
          that are set over you; and "learn, whatsoever state you shall be in,
          therewith to be content," Phil.4:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I have spoken to you, I hope your wives also will suffer the word
          of exhortation,
        </p>
        <p>
          Your behavior on shipboard especially the first part of the voyage, I
          choose to throw a cloak over; for to use them mildest terms, it was
          not such as became the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. However, of
          late, blessed be God, you have taken more heed to your ways, and some
          of you have walked all the while, as became "women professing
          godliness." Let those accept my hearty thanks, and permit me to
          entreat you all in general, as you are all now married, to remember
          the solemn vow you made at your entrance into the marriage state, and
          see that you be subject to your own husbands, in every lawful thing:
          Beg of God to keep the door of your lips, that you offend not with
          your tongues; and walk in love, that your prayers be not hindered. You
          that have children, let it be your chief concern to breed them up in
          the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And live all of you so holy
          and unblameable, that you may not so much as be suspected to be
          unchaste; and as some of you have imitated Mary Magdalen in her sin,
          strive to imitate her also in her repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for you, sailors, what shall I say? How shall I address myself to
          you? How shall I do that which I so much long to do; touch your
          hearts? Gratitude obliges me to wish thus well to you. For you have
          often taught me many instructive lessons, and reminded me to put up
          many prayers to God for you, that you might receive your spiritual
          sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I have seen you preparing for a storm, and reefing [could also be
          reesing] your sails to guard against it; how have I wished that you
          and I were as careful to avoid that storm of God's wrath, which will
          certainly, without repentance, quickly overtake us? When I have
          observed you catch at ever fair gale, how I secretly cried, O that we
          were as careful to know the things that belong to our peace, before
          they are forever hid from our eyes! And when I have taken notice, how
          steadily you eyed your compass in order to steer aright, how have I
          wished, that we as steadily eyed the word of God, which alone can
          preserve us from "making shipwreck of faith, and a good conscience!"
          In short, there is scarce anything you do, which has not been a lesson
          of instruction to me; and, therefore, it would me ungrateful in me,
          did I not take this opportunity of exhorting you in the name of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, to be as wise in the things which concern you soul,
          as I have observed you to be in the affairs belonging to your ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible, that the sea is reckoned but an ill school to learn
          Christ in: and to see a devout sailor, is esteemed an uncommon a
          thing, as to see a Saul amongst the prophets. But whence this
          wondering? Whence this looking upon a godly sailor, as a man to be
          wondered at, as a speckled bird in the creation? I am sure, for the
          little time I have come in and out amongst you, and as far as I can
          judge from the little experience I have had of things, I scarce know
          any way of life, that is capable of greater improvements than yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continual danger you are in of being overwhelmed by the great
          waters; the many opportunities you have of beholding God's wonders in
          the deep; the happy retirement you enjoy from worldly temptations; and
          the daily occasions that are offered you, to endure hardships, are
          such noble means of promoting the spiritual life, that were your
          hearts bent towards God, you would account it your happiest, that his
          providence has called you, to "go down to the sea in ships, and to
          occupy your business in the great waters."
        </p>
        <p>
          The royal Psalmist knew this, and, therefore, in the words of the
          text, calls more especially on men of your employ, to "praise the Lord
          for his goodness, and declare the wonders he doeth for the children of
          men."
        </p>
        <p>
          And O that you would be wise in time, and hearken to his voice today,
          "whilst it is called to-day!" For ye yourselves know how little is to
          be done on a sick bed. God has, in an especial manner, of late,
          invited you to repentance: two of your crew he has taken off by death,
          and most of you he has mercifully visited with a grievous sickness.
          The terrors of the Lord have been upon you, and when burnt with a
          scorching fever, some of you have cried out, "What shall w do to be
          saved?" Remember then the resolutions you made, when you thought God
          was about to take away your souls; and see that according to your
          promises, you show forth your thankfulness, not only with your lips,
          but in your lives. For though God may bear long, he will not forbear
          always; and if these signal mercies and judgments do not lead you to
          repentance, assure yourselves there will at last come a fiery tempest,
          from the presence of the Lord, which will sweep away you, and all
          other adversaries of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am positive, neither you nor the soldiers have wanted, nor will want
          any manner of encouragement to piety and holiness of living, from
          those two persons who have here the government over you; for they have
          been such helps to me in my ministry, and have so readily concurred in
          every thing for your good, that they may justly demand a public
          acknowledgment of thanks both from you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permit me, my honored friends, in the name of both classes of your
          people, to return you hearty thanks for the ears and tenderness you
          have expressed for the welfare of their better parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the private favors you have shown to my person, I hope so deep
          a sense of them is imprinted on my heart, that I shall plead them
          before God in prayer, as long as I live.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have still stronger obligations to intercede in your behalf. For
          God, ever adored be his free grace in Christ Jesus! Has set his seal
          to my ministry in your hearts. Some distant pangs of the new birth I
          have observed to come upon you; and God forbid that I should sin
          against the Lord, by ceasing to pray, that the good work begun in your
          souls, may be carried on till the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time of our departure from each other is not at hand, and you are
          going out into a world of temptations. But though absent in body, let
          us be present with each other in spirit; and God, I trust, will enable
          you to be singularly good, to be ready to be accounted fools for
          Christ's sake; and then we shall meet never to part again in the
          kingdom of our Father which is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          To you, my companions and familiar friends, who came over with me to
          sojourn in a strange land, do I in the next place address myself. For
          you I especially fear, as well as for myself, because as we take sweet
          counsel together oftner than others, and as you are let into a more
          intimate friendship with me in private life, the eyes of all men will
          be upon you to note even the minutest miscarriage; and, therefore, it
          highly concerns you to "walk circumspectly towards those that are
          without," I hope, that nothing but a single eye to God's glory and the
          salvation of your own souls, brought you from your native country.
          Remember than the end of your coming hither, and you can never do
          amiss. Be patterns of industry, as well as of piety, to those who
          shall be around you; and above all things let us have such fervent
          charity amongst ourselves, that it may be said of us, as of the
          primitive Christians, "See how the Christians love one another."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I have been speaking to others particularly, I have one
          general request to make to all, and that with reference to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have heard, my dear friends, how I have been exhorting every one
          of you to show forth your thankfulness for the divine goodness, not
          only with your lips, but in your lives. But "physician heal thyself,"
          may justly be retorted on me. For (without any false pretenses to
          humility) I find my own heart so little inclined to this duty of
          thanksgiving for the benefits I have received, that I had need fear
          sharing Hezekiah's fate, who because he was lifted up by, and not
          thankful enough for, the great things God had done for him, was given
          up a prey to the pride of his own heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need, therefore, and beg your most importunate petitions at the
          throne of grace, that no such evil may befall me; that the more Go
          exalts me, the more I may debase myself; and that after I have
          preached to others, I myself may not be cast away.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, brethren, into God's hands I commend your spirits, who, I
          trust, through his infinite mercies in Christ Jesus, will preserve you
          blameless, till his second coming to judge the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excuse my detaining you for long; perhaps it is the last time I shall
          speak to you: my heart is full, and out of the abundance of it, I
          could continue my discourse until midnight. But I must away to your
          new world; may God give you new hearts, and enable you to put in
          practice what you have heard from time to time, to by your duty, and I
          need not wish you anything better. For then God will so bless you,
          that "you will build you cities to dwell in; then will you sow your
          lands and plant vineyards, which will yield you fruits of increase,"
          Psalm 107:37. "Then your oxen shall be strong to labor, there shall be
          no leading into captivity, and no complaining in your streets; then
          shall your sons grow up as the young plants, and your daughters be as
          the polished corners of the temple: then shall your garners be full
          and plenteous with all manner of store, and your sheep bring forth
          thousands, and ten thousands in your streets," Psalm 144 In short,
          then shall the Lord be your God; and as surely as he has now brought
          us to this haven, where we would be, so surely, after we have past
          through the storms and tempests of this troublesome world, will he
          bring us to the haven of eternal rest, where we shall have nothing to
          do, but to praise him for ever for his goodness, and declare, in
          never-ceasing songs of praise, the wonders he has done for us, and all
          the other sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          "To which blessed rest, God of his infinite mercy bring us all,
          through Jesus Christ our Lord! To whom with the Father and Holy Ghost
          be all honor and glory, might, majesty, and dominion, now, henceforth,
          and forevermore. Amen, Amen."<br />
