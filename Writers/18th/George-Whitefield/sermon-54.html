          Philippians 3:10 -- "That I may know Him, and the power of his
          resurrection."
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle, in the verses before the text, had been cautioning the
          Philippians to "beware of the concision," Judaizing teachers, who
          endeavored to subvert them from the simplicity of the gospel, by
          telling them, they still ought to be subject to circumcision, and all
          the other ordinances of Moses. And that they might not think he spoke
          out of prejudice, and condemned their tenets, because he himself was a
          stranger to the Jewish dispensation, he acquaints them, that if any
          other man thought he had whereof he might trust in the flesh, or seek
          to be justified by the outward privileges of the Jews, he had more:
          For he was "circumcised the eighth day; of the stock of Israel (not a
          proselyte, but a native Israelite); of the tribe of Benjamin (the
          tribe which adhered to Judah when the others revolted); an Hebrew of
          the Hebrews (a Jew both on the father's and mother's side); and as
          touching the law, a Pharisee," the strictest sect amongst all Israel.
          To show that he was no Gallio in religion, through his great, though
          misguided zeal, he had persecuted the church of Christ; and "as
          touching the righteousness of the law (as far as the Pharisees
          exposition of it went, he was) blameless," and had kept it from his
          youth. But, when it pleased God, who separated him from his mother's
          womb, to reveal his Son in him, "What things were gain to me," (he
          says) those privileges I boasted myself in, and sought to be justified
          by, "I counted loss for Christ." And that they might not think he
          repented that he had done so, he tells them, he was now more confirmed
          than ever in his judgment. For, says he, "yea doubtless (the
          expression in the original rises with a holy triumph) and I do count
          all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
          Jesus my Lord." And that they might not object that he said, and did
          not, he acquaints them, he had given proofs of the sincerity of these
          professions, because for the sake of them, he had suffered the loss of
          all his worldly things, and still was willing to do more; for, "I
          count them but dung (no more than offals thrown out to dogs) so that I
          may win, (or have a saving interest in) Christ, and be found in him(
          as the manslayer in the city of refuge) not having my own
          righteousness which is of the law, (not depending on having Abraham
          for my father, or on any works of righteousness which I have done,
          either to atone or serve as a balance for my evil deeds) but that
          which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of
          God by faith," a righteousness of God's appointing, and which will be
          imputed to me, if I believe in Christ, "that I may know him, and the
          power of his resurrection;" that I may have an experimental knowledge
          of the efficacy of his resurrection, by feeling the influences of his
          blessed Spirit on my soul. In which words two things are implied.
        </p>
        <p>First, That Jesus Christ did rise from the dead.</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, That it highly concerns us to know the power of his rising
          again.
        </p>
        <p>Accordingly, in the following discourse I shall endeavor to show,</p>
        <p>
          First, That Christ is risen indeed from the dead; and that it was
          necessary for him so to do; and,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, That it highly concerns us to know and experience the power
          of his resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>First, Christ is indeed risen.</p>
        <p>That Jesus should rise from the dead was absolutely necessary;</p>
        <p>
          1. First, On his own account. He had often appealed to this as the
          last and most convincing proof he would give them that the was the
          Messiah, "There shall no other sign be given you, than the sign of the
          prophet Jonas." And again, "Destroy this temple of my body, and in
          three days I will build it up." Which words his enemies remembered,
          and urged it as an argument, to induce Pilate to grant them a watch,
          to prevent his being stolen out of the grave. "We know that deceiver
          said, whilst he was yet alive, after three days I will rise again." So
          that had he not risen again, they might have justly said, we know that
          this man was an impostor.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secondly, It was necessary on our account. "He rose again" (says
          the apostle) for our justification;" or that the debt we owed to God
          for our sins, might be fully satisfied and discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had pleased the Father (for ever adored be his infinite love and
          free grace) to wound his only Son for our transgressions, and to
          arrest and confine him in the prison of the grave, as our surety for
          the guilt we had contracted by setting at nought his commandments. Now
          had Christ continued always in the grave, we could have had no more
          assurance that our sins were satisfied for, than any common debtor can
          have of his creditor's being satisfied, whilst his surety is kept
          confined. But he being released from the power of death, we are
          thereby assured, that with his sacrifice God was well pleased, that
          our atonement was finished on the cross, and that he hath made a full,
          perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the
          sins of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly, It was necessary that our Lord Jesus should rise again
          from the dead, to assure us of the certainty of the resurrection of
          our own bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the resurrection of the body was entirely exploded and
          set at nought among the Gentiles, as appears from the Athenians
          mocking at, and calling St. Paul "a babbler and a setter forth of
          strange doctrines," when he preached to them Jesus, and the
          resurrection. And though it was believed by most of the Jews, as is
          evident from many passages of scripture, yet not by all; the whole
          sect of the Sadducees denied it. But the resurrection of Jesus Christ
          put it out of dispute. For as he acted as our representative, if he
          our head be risen, then must we also, who are his members, rise with
          him. And as in the first Adam we all died, even so in him our second
          Adam we must all, in this sense, be made alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it was necessary, upon these accounts, that our blessed Lord should
          rise from the dead; so it is plain beyond contradiction, that he did.
          Never was any matter of fact better attested; never were more
          precautions made use of to prevent a cheat. He was buried in a
          sepulcher, hewn out of a rock, so that it could not be said that any
          digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a sepulcher also wherein
          never man before was laid; so that if any body did rise from thence,
          it must be the body of Jesus of Nazareth. Besides, the sepulcher was
          sealed; a great stone rolled over the mouth of it; and a band of
          soldiers (consisting not of friends, but of his professed enemies) was
          set to guard it. And as for his disciples coming by night and stealing
          him away, it was altogether improbable: For it was not long since,
          that they had all forsaken him, and they were the most backward in
          believing his resurrection. And supposing it was true, that they came
          whilst the soldiers slept; yet the soldiers must be cast into a deep
          sleep indeed, that the rolling away so great a stone did not awake
          some of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And our blessed Lord's afterwards appearing at sundry times, and in
          divers manners, to his disciples, as when they were assembled
          together, when they were walking to Emmaus, when they were fishing:
          nay, and condescending to show them his hands and feet, and his
          appearing to above five hundred brethren at once, put the truth of his
          resurrection out of all dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, there is one objection that may be made against what has been
          said, that the books wherein these facts are recorded were written by
          his disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          And who more proper persons than those who were eye-witnesses of what
          they related, and eat and drank with him after his resurrection? "But
          they were illiterate and ignorant men." Yet as good witnesses of a
          plain matter of fact, as the most learned masters in Israel. Nay, this
          rendered them more proper witnesses. For being plain men, they were
          therefore less to be suspected of telling or making a lie,
          particularly, since they laid down their lives for a testimony of the
          truth of it. We read indeed of Jacob's telling a lie, though he was a
          plain man, in order to get his father's blessing. But it was never
          heard since the world began, that any man, much less a whole set of
          men, died martyrs, for the sake of an untruth, when they themselves
          were to reap no advantage from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, this single circumstance proves them to Israelites indeed, in whom
          was no guile. And the wonderful success God gave to their ministry
          afterwards, when three thousand were converted by one sermon; and
          twelve poor fishermen, in a very short time enabled to be more than
          conquerors over all the opposition men or devils could make, was as
          plain a demonstration, that Christ was risen, according to their
          gospel, as that a divine power, at the sound of a few ram's horns,
          causes the walls of Jericho to fall down.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what need we any farther witnesses? Believe you the resurrection
          of our blessed Lord? I know that you believe it, as your gathering
          together on this first day of the week in the courts of the Lord's
          house abundantly testifies.
        </p>
        <p>What concerns us most to be assured of, and which is the</p>
        <p>
          Second thin I was to speak to, is, Whether we have experimentally
          known the power of his resurrection; that is, Whether or not we have
          received the Holy Ghost, and by his powerful operations on our hearts
          have been raised from the death of sin, to a life of righteousness and
          true holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this, the great apostle was chiefly desirous to know. The
          resurrection of Christ's body he was satisfied would avail him
          nothing, unless he experienced the power of it in raising his dead
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          For another, and that a chief end of our blessed Lord's rising from
          the dead, was to enter heaven as our representative, and to send down
          the Holy Ghost to apply that redemption he had finished on the cross,
          to our hearts, by working an entire change in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this, Christ would have died in vain. For it would have done
          us no service to have had his outward righteousness imputed to us,
          unless we had an inward inherent righteousness wrought in us. Because,
          being altogether conceived and born in sin, and consequently unfit to
          hold communion with an infinitely pure and holy God, we cannot
          possibly be made meet to see or enjoy him, till a thorough renovation
          has passed upon our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this, we leave out the Holy Ghost in the great work of our
          redemption. But as we were made by the joint concurrence and
          consultation of the blessed trinity; and as we were baptized in their
          name, so must all of them concur in our salvation: As the Father made,
          and the Son redeemed, so must the Holy Ghost sanctify and seal us, or
          otherwise we have believed in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then is what the apostle means by the "Power of Christ's
          resurrection," and this is what we are as much concerned
          experimentally to know, as that He rose at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this, though we may be moralists, though we may be civilized,
          good-natured people, yet we are no Christians. For he is not a true
          Christian, who is only one outwardly; nor have we therefore a right,
          because we daily profess to believe that Christ rose again the third
          day from the dead. But he is a true Christian who is one inwardly; and
          then only can we be stiled true believers, when we not only profess to
          believe, but have felt the power of our blessed Lord's rising from the
          dead, by being quickened and raised by his Spirit, when dead in
          trespasses and sins, to a thorough newness both of heart and life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devils themselves cannot but believe the doctrine of the
          resurrection, and tremble; but yet they continue devils, because the
          benefits of this resurrection have not been applied to them, nor have
          they received a renovating power from it, to change and put off their
          diabolical nature. And so, unless we not only profess to know, but
          also feel that Christ is risen indeed, by being born again from above,
          we shall be as far from the kingdom of God as they: our faith will be
          as ineffectual as the faith of devils.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing has done more harm to the Christian world, nothing has
          rendered the cross of Christ of less effect, than a vain supposition,
          that religion is something without us. Whereas we should consider,
          that every thing that Christ did outwardly, must be done over again in
          our souls; or otherwise, the believing there was such a divine person
          once on earth, who triumphed over hell and the grave, will profit us
          no more, than believing there was once such a person as Alexander, who
          conquered the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christ was born of the Virgin's womb, so must he be spiritually
          formed in our hearts. As he died for sin, so must we die to sin. And
          as he rose again from the dead, so must we also rise to a divine life.
        </p>
        <p>
          None but those who have followed him in this regeneration, or new-
          birth, shall sit on thrones as approvers of his sentence, when he
          shall come in terrible majesty to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, as for the outward work of our redemption, it was a
          transient act, and was certainly finished on the cross, but the
          application of that redemption to our hearts, is a work that will
          continue always, even unto the end of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So long as there is an elect man breathing on the earth, who is
          naturally engendered of the offspring of the first Adam, so long must
          the quickening spirit, which was purchased by the resurrection of the
          second Adam, that Lord from heaven, be breathing upon his soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          For though we may exist by Christ, yet we cannot be said to exist in
          him, till we are united to him by one spirit, and enter into a new
          state of things, as certainly as he entered into a new state of
          things, after that he rose from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may throng and crowd about Christ, and call him "Lord, Lord," when
          we come to worship before his footstool; but we have not effectually
          touched him, till by a lively faith in his resurrection, we perceive a
          divine virtue coming out of him, to renew and purify our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          How greatly then do they err who rest in a bare historical faith of
          our Savior's resurrection, and look only for external proofs to
          evidence it? Whereas were we the most learned disputers of this world,
          and could speak of the certainty of this fact with the tongue of men
          and angels, yet without this inward testimony of it in our hearts,
          though we might convince others, yet we should never be saved by it
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          For we are but dead men, we are like so many carcasses wrapt up in
          grave clothes, till that same Jesus who called Lazarus from his tomb,
          and at whose own resurrection many that slept arose, doth raise us
          also by his quickening Spirit from our natural death, in which we have
          so long lain, to a holy and heavenly life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might think ourselves happy, if we had seen the Holy Jesus after He
          was risen from the dead, and our hands had handled that Lord of life.
          But more happy are they who have not seen him, and yet having felt the
          power of his resurrection, therefore believe in him. For many saw our
          divine master, who were not saved by him; but whosoever has thus felt
          the power of his resurrection, has the earnest of his inheritance in
          his heart, he has passed from death to life, and shall never fall into
          final condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very sensible that this is foolishness to the natural man, as
          were many such like truths to our Lord's own disciples, when only weak
          in faith, before he rose again. But when these natural men, like them,
          have fully felt the power of his resurrection, they will then own that
          this doctrine is from God, and say with the Samaritans, "Now we
          believe not because of thy saying," for we ourselves have experienced
          it in our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And O that all unbelievers, all letter-learned masters of Israel, who
          now look upon the doctrine of the power of Christ's resurrection, or
          our new birth, as an idle tale, and condemn the preachers of it as
          enthusiasts and madmen, did but thus feel the power of it in their
          souls, they would no longer ask, how this thing could be? But they
          would be convinced of it, as much as Thomas was, when he saw the
          Lord's Christ; and like him, when Jesus bud him reach out his hands
          and thrust them into his side, in a holy confession they would cry
          out, "My Lord and my God!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But how shall an unbeliever, how shall the formal Christian come thus
          to "know Christ, and the power of his resurrection?" God, who cannot
          lie, has told us, "I am the resurrection and the life, whosoever
          liveth and believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."
          Again, says the apostle, "By faith we are saved, and that not of
          ourselves, it is the gift of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          This, this is the way, walk in it. Believe, and you shall live in
          Christ, and Christ in you; you shall be one with Christ, and Christ
          one with you. But without this, your outward goodness and professions
          will avail you nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, by this faith we are not to understand a dead speculative
          faith, a faith in the head; but a living principle wrought in the
          heart by the powerful operations of the Holy Ghost, a faith that will
          enable us to overcome the world, and forsake all the affection for
          Jesus Christ. For thus speaks our blessed Master, "Unless a man
          forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the apostle, in the words immediately following the text, says,
          "being made conformable to his death;" thereby implying, that we
          cannot know the power of Christ's resurrection, unless we are made
          conformable to him in his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we can reconcile light and darkness, heaven and hell, then we may
          hope to know the power of Christ's resurrection without dying to
          ourselves and the world. But till we can do this, we might as well
          expect that Christ will have concord with Belial.
        </p>
        <p>
          For there is such a contrariety between the spirit of this world, and
          the Spirit of Jesus Christ, that he who will be at friendship with the
          one, must be at enmity with the other: "We cannot serve God and
          mammon."
        </p>
        <p>
          This may, indeed, seem a hard saying; and many, with the young man in
          the gospel, may be tempted to go away sorrowful. But wherefore should
          this offend them? For what is all that is in the world, the lust of
          the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, but vanity and
          vexation of spirit?
        </p>
        <p>
          God is love; and therefore, could our own wills, or the world, have
          made us happy, he never would have sent his own dear Son Jesus Christ
          to die and rise again, to deliver us from the power of them. But
          because they only torment, and cannot satisfy, therefore God bids us
          to renounce them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had any one persuaded profane Esau not to lose so glorious a
          privilege, merely for the sake of gratifying a present corrupt
          inclination, when he saw him about to sell his birth-right for a
          little red pottage, would not one think that man to have been Esau's
          friend? And just thus stands the case between God and us. By the death
          and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are new-born to an heavenly
          inheritance amongst all them which are sanctified; but our own corrupt
          wills, would tempt us to sell this glorious birth-right for the
          vanities of the world, which, like Esau's red pottage, may please us
          for a while, but will soon be taken away from us. God knows this, and
          therefore rather bids us renounce them for a reason, than for the
          short enjoyment of them lost the privilege of that glorious
          birth-right, to which, by knowing the power of the resurrection of
          Jesus Christ, we are entitled.

          O the depth of the riches and excellency of Christianity! Well might
          the great St. Paul count all things but dung and dross for the
          excellency of the knowledge of it. Well might he desire so ardently to
          know Jesus, and the power of his resurrection. For even on this side
          eternity it raises us above the world, and makes us to sit in heavenly
          places in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well might that glorious company of worthies, recorded in the Holy
          scriptures, supported with a deep sense of their heavenly calling,
          despise the pleasures and profits of this life, and wander about in
          sheep-skins, and goat-skins, in dens and caves of the earth, being
          destitute, afflicted, tormented.
        </p>
        <p>
          And O that we were all like minded! That we felt the power of Christ's
          resurrection as they did! How should we then "count all things as dung
          and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our
          Lord!" How should we then recover our primitive dignity, trample the
          earth under our feet, and with our souls be continually gasping after
          God?
        </p>
        <p>
          And what hinders but we may be thus minded? Is Jesus Christ, our great
          High Priest, altered from what he was? No, "he is the same yesterday,
          today, and for ever." And though he is exalted to the right hand of
          God, yet he is not ashamed to call us brethren. The power of his
          resurrection is as great now as formerly, and the Holy Spirit, which
          was assured to us by his resurrection, as ready and able to quicken us
          who are dead in trespasses and sins, as any saint that ever lived. Let
          us but cry, and that instantly, to Him that is mighty and able to
          save; let us, in sincerity and truth, without secretly keeping back
          the least part, renounce ourselves and the world; then we shall be
          Christians indeed. And though the world may cast us out, and separate
          from our company, yet Jesus Christ will walk with, and abide in us.
          And at the general resurrection of the last day, when the voice of the
          archangel and trump of God shall bid the sea and the graves to give up
          their dead, and all nations shall appear before him, then will he
          confess us before his Father and the holy angels, and we shall receive
          that invitation which he shall then pronounce to all who love and fear
          him, "Come, ye blessed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom
          prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's sake, Jesus Christ our Lord;
          to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.<br />
