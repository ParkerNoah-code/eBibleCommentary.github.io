          Jeremiah 18:1-6 -- "The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord,
          saying, Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will
          cause thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's house,
          and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he
          made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again
          another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make [it]. Then the
          word of the Lord came to me, saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do
          with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay [is] in
          the potter's hand, so [are] ye in mine hand, O house of Israel."
        </p>
        <p>
          At sundry times, and in diverse manners, God was pleased to speak to
          our fathers by the prophets, before he spoke to us in these last days
          by his Son. To Elijah, he revealed himself by a small still voice. To
          Jacob, by a dream. To Moses, he spoke face to face. Sometimes he was
          pleased to send a favorite prophet on some especial errand; and whilst
          he was thus employed, vouchsafed to give him a particular message,
          which he was ordered to deliver without reserve to all the inhabitants
          of the land. A very instructive instance of this kind we have recorded
          in the passage now read to you. The first verse informs us that it was
          a word, or message, which came immediately from the Lord to the
          prophet Jeremiah. At what time, or how the prophet was employed when
          it came, we are not told. Perhaps, whilst he was praying for those who
          would not pray for themselves. Perhaps, near the morning, when he was
          slumbering or musing on his bed. For the word came to him, saying,
          "Arise." And what must he do when risen? He must "go down to the
          potter's house" (the prophet knew where to find it) "and there (says
          the great Jehovah) I will cause thee to hear my words." Jeremiah does
          not confer with flesh and blood, he does not object that it was dark
          or cold, or desire that he might have his message given him there, but
          without the least hesitation is immediately obedient to the heavenly
          vision. "Then (says he) I went down to the potter's house, and behold
          he wrought a work upon the wheels." Just as he was entering into the
          house or workshop, the potter, it seems, had a vessel upon his wheel.
          And was there any thing so extraordinary in this, that it should be
          ushered in with the word Behold? What a dreaming visionary, or
          superstitious enthusiast, would this Jeremiah be accounted, even by
          many who read his prophecies with seeming respect, was he alive now?
          But this was not the first time Jeremiah had heard from heaven in this
          manner. He therefore willingly obeyed; and had you or I accompanied
          him to the potter's house, I believe we should have seen him silently,
          but intensely waiting upon his great and all-wise Commander, to know
          wherefore he sent him thither. Methinks I see him all attention. He
          takes notice, that "the vessel was of clay;" but as he held it in his
          hand, and turned round the wheel, in order to work it into some
          particular form, "it was marred in the hands of the potter," and
          consequently unfit for the use he before intended to put it to. And
          what becomes of this marred vessel? Being thus marred, I suppose, the
          potter, without the least imputation of injustice, might have thrown
          it aside, and taken up another piece of clay in its room. But he did
          not. "He made it again another vessel." And does the potter call a
          council of his domestics, to inquire of them what kind of vessel they
          would advise him to make of it? No, in no wise. "He made it again
          another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then," adds Jeremiah, whilst he was in the way of duty -- then --
          whilst he was mentally crying, Lord what wouldst thou have me to do?
          "Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, O house of Israel,
          cannot I do with you as this potter? Saith the Lord. Behold, as the
          clay is in the hands of the potter (marred, and unfit for the first
          designed purpose) so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel." At
          length, then, Jeremiah hath his sermon given to him: short, but
          popular. It was to be delivered to the whole house of Israel, princes,
          priests, and people: short, but pungent, even sharper than a two-edged
          sword. What! says the sovereign Lord of heaven and earth, must I be
          denied the privilege of a common potter? May I not do what I will with
          my own? "Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hands, so are ye in
          mine hands, O house of Israel. I made and formed you into a people,
          and blessed you above any other nation under heaven: but, O Israel,
          thou by thy backslidings hast destroyed thyself. As the potter
          therefore might justly have thrown aside his marred clay, so may I
          justly unchurch and unpeople you. But what if I should come over the
          mountains of your guilt, heal your backslidings, revive my work in the
          midst of the years, and cause your latter end greatly to increase?
          Behold, as the clay is in the hands of the potter, lying at his
          disposal, either to be destroyed or formed into another vessel, so are
          ye in my hands, O house of Israel: I may either reject, and thereby
          ruin you, or I may revisit and revive you according to my own
          sovereign good will and pleasure, and who shall say unto me, what dost
          thou?"
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems to be the genuine interpretation, and primary intention of
          this beautiful part of holy writ. But waving all further inquiries
          about its primary design or meaning, I shall now proceed to show, that
          what the glorious Jehovah here says of the house of Israel in general,
          is applicable to every individual of mankind in particular. And as I
          presume this may be done, without either wire-drawing scripture on the
          one hand, or wrestling it from its original meaning on the other, not
          to detain you any longer, I shall, from the passage thus explained and
          paraphrased, deduce, and endeavor to enlarge on these two general
          heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall undertake to prove, that every man naturally engendered
          of the offspring of Adam, is in the sight of the all-seeing, heart-
          searching God, only as a "piece of marred clay."
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, That being thus marred, he must necessarily be renewed: and
          under this head, we shall likewise point out by whose agency this
          mighty change is to be brought about.
        </p>
        <p>
          These particulars being discussed, way will naturally be made for a
          short word of application.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, To prove that every man naturally engendered of the offspring
          of Adam, is in the sight of an all-seeing, heart-searching God, only
          as a piece of marred clay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be pleased to observe, that we say every man naturally engendered of
          the offspring of Adam, or every man since the fall: for if we consider
          man as he first came out of the hands of his Maker, he was far from
          being in such melancholy circumstances. No; he was originally made
          upright; or as Moses, that sacred penman, declares, "God made him
          after his own image." Surely never was so much expressed in so few
          words; which hath often made me wonder how that great critic Longinus,
          who so justly admires the dignity and grandeur of Moses's account of
          the creation, and "God said, Let there be light, and there was light;"
          I say I have often wondered why he did not read a little further, and
          bestow as just an encomium [praise, approval, acclaim] upon this
          short, but withal inexpressibly august [noble, elegant, superb] and
          comprehensive description of the formation of man, "so God created man
          in his own image." Struck with a deep sense of such amazing goodness,
          and that he might impress yet a deeper sense of it upon our minds too,
          he immediately adds, "in the image of God made he him." A council of
          the most adorable Trinity was called on this important occasion: God
          did not say, Let there be a man, and there was a man, but God said,
          "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." This is the
          account which the lively oracles of God do give us of man in his first
          estate; but it is very remarkable, that the transition from the
          account of his creation to that of his misery, is very quick, and why?
          For a very good reason, because he soon fell from his primeval
          dignity; and by that fall, the divine image is so defaced, that he is
          now to be valued only as antiquarians value an ancient medal, merely
          for the sake of the image and superscription once stamped upon it; or
          of a second divine impress, which, through grace, it may yet receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us take a more particular survey of him, and see whether these
          things are so or not: and first, as to his understanding. As man was
          created originally "after God in knowledge," as well as righteousness
          and true holiness, we may rationally infer, that his understanding, in
          respect to things natural, as well as divine, was of a prodigious
          extent: for he was make but a little lower than the angels, and
          consequently being like them, excellent in his understanding, he knew
          much of God, of himself, and all about him; and in this as well as
          every other respect, was, as Mr. Golter expresses it in one of his
          essays, a perfect major: but this is far from being our case now. For
          in respect to natural things, our understandings are evidently
          darkened. It is but little that we can know, and even that little
          knowledge which we can acquire, is with much weariness of the flesh,
          and we are doomed to gain it as we do our daily bread, I mean by the
          sweat of our brows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men of low and narrow minds soon commence wise in their own conceits:
          and having acquired a little smattering of the learned languages, and
          made some small proficiency in the dry sciences, are easily tempted to
          look upon themselves as a head taller than their fellow mortals, and
          accordingly too, too often put forth great swelling words of vanity.
          But persons of a more exalted, and extensive reach of thought, dare
          not boast. No: they know that the greatest scholars are in the dark,
          in respect to many even of the minutest things in life: and after all
          their painful researches into the Arcana Natura, they find such an
          immense void, such an unmeasurable expanse yet to be traveled over,
          that they are obliged at last to conclude, almost with respect to
          every thing, "that they know nothing yet as they ought to know." This
          consideration, no doubt, led Socrates, when he was asked by one of his
          scholars, why the oracle pronounced him the wisest man on earth, to
          give him this judicious answer, "Perhaps it is, because I am most
          sensible of my own ignorance." Would to God, that all who call
          themselves Christians, had learned so much as this heathen! We should
          then no longer hear so many learned men, falsely so called, betray
          their ignorance by boasting of the extent of their shallow
          understanding, nor by professing themselves so wise, prove themselves
          such arrant pedantic fools.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we view our understandings in respect to spiritual things, we shall
          find that they are not only darkened, but become darkness itself, even
          "darkness that may be felt" by all who are not past feeling. And how
          should it be otherwise, since the infallible word of God assures us,
          that they are alienated from the light of life of God, and thereby
          naturally as incapable to judge of divine and spiritual things,
          comparatively speaking, as a man born blind is incapacitated to
          distinguish the various colors of the rainbow. "The natural man, (says
          on inspired apostle) discerneth not the things of the Spirit of God;"
          so far from it, "they are foolishness unto him;" and why? Because they
          are only to be "spiritually discerned." Hence it was, that Nicodemus,
          who was blessed with an outward and divine revelation, who was a ruler
          of the Jews, nay a master of Israel, when our Lord told him, "he must
          be born again;" appeared to be quite grappled. "How (says he) can a
          man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his
          mother's womb and be born? How can these things be?" Were three more
          absurd questions ever proposed by the most ignorant man alive? Or can
          there be a clearer proof of the blindness of man's understanding, in
          respect to divine, as well as natural things? Is not man then a piece
          of marred clay?
        </p>
        <p>
          This will appear yet more evident, if we consider the perverse bent of
          his will. Being made in the very image of God; undoubtedly before the
          fall, man had no other will but his Maker's. God's will, and Adam's,
          were than like unisons in music. There was not the least disunion, or
          discord between them. But now he hath a will, as directly contrary to
          the will of God, as light is contrary to darkness, or heaven to hell.
          We all bring into the world with us a carnal mind, which is not only
          an enemy to God, but "enmity itself, and which is therefore not
          subject unto the law of God, neither indeed can it be." A great many
          show much zeal in talking against the man of sin, and loudly (and
          indeed very justly) exclaim against the Pope for sitting in the
          temple, I mean the church of Christ, and "exalting himself above all
          that is called God." But say not within thyself, who shall go to Rome,
          to pull down this spiritual antichrist? As though there was no
          antichrist but what is without us. For know, O man, whoever thou art,
          an infinitely more dangerous antichrist, because less discerned, even
          self-will, fits daily in the temple of thy heart, exalting itself,
          above all that is called God, and obliging all its votaries to say of
          Christ himself, that Prince of peace, "we will not have this man to
          reign over us." God's people, whose spiritual senses, are exercised
          about spiritual things, and whose eyes are opened to see the
          abominations that are in their hearts, frequently feel this to their
          sorrow. Whether they will or not, this enmity from time to time
          bubbles up, and in spite of all their watchfulness and care, when they
          are under the pressure of some sharp affliction, a long desertion, or
          tedious night of temptation, they often find something within rising
          in rebellion against the all-wise disposals of divine Providence, and
          saying unto God their heavenly Father, "what dost thou?" This makes
          them to cry (and no wonder, since it constrained one of the greatest
          saints and apostles first to introduce the expression) "O wretched man
          that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" The
          spiritual and renewed soul groans thus, being burdened; but as for the
          natural and unawakened man, it is not so with him; self-will, as well
          as every other evil, either in a more latent or discernible manner,
          reigns in his unrenewed soul, and proves him, even to a demonstration
          to others, whether he knows, or will confess it himself or not, that
          in respect to the disorders of his will, as well as his understanding,
          man is only a piece of marred clay.
        </p>
        <p>
          A transient view of fallen man's affections will yet more firmly
          corroborate this melancholy truth, These, at his being first placed in
          the paradise of God, were always kept within proper bounds, fixed upon
          their proper objects, and, like so many gentle rivers, sweetly,
          spontaneously and habitually glided into their ocean, God. But now the
          scene is changed. For we are not naturally full of vile affections,
          which like a mighty and impetuous torrent carry all before them. We
          love what we should hate, and hate what we should love; we fear what
          we should hope for, and hope for what we should fear; nay, to such an
          ungovernable height do our affections sometimes rise, that though our
          judgments are convinced to the contrary, yet we will gratify our
          passions though it be at the expense of our present and eternal
          welfare. We feel a war of our affections, warring against the law of
          our minds, and bringing us into captivity to the law of sin and death.
          So that video meliora proboque, deteriora foquor [latin phrase], I
          approve of better things but follow worse, is too, too often the
          practice of us all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible, that many are offended, when mankind are compared to
          beasts and devils. And they might have some shadow of reason for being
          so, if we asserted in a physical sense, that they were really beasts
          and really devils. For then, as I once heard a very learned prelate,
          who was objecting against this comparison, observe, "a man being a
          beast would be incapable, and being a devil, would be under an
          impossibility of being saved." But when we make use of such shocking
          comparisons, as he was pleased to term them, we would be understood
          only in a moral sense; and in so doing, we assert no more than some of
          the most holy men of God have said of themselves, and others, in the
          lively oracles many ages ago. Holy David, the man after God's own
          heart, speaking of himself, says, "so foolish was I, and as a beast
          before thee." And holy Job, speaking of man in general, says, that "he
          is born as a wild ass's colt," or take away the expletive, which as
          some think ought to be done, and then he positively asserts, that man
          is a wild ass's colt. And what says our Lord, "Ye are of your father
          the devil;" and "the whole world is said to lie in him, the wicked
          one, who now rules in the children of disobedience," that is, in all
          unrenewed souls. Our stupidity, proneness to fix our affections on the
          things of the earth, and our eagerness to make provision for the
          flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, evidence us to be earthly and
          brutes!; and our mental passions, anger, hatred, malice, envy, and
          such like, prove with equal strength, that we are also devilish. Both
          together conspire to evince, that in respect to his affections, as
          well as his understanding and will, man deservedly may be termed a
          piece of marred clay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The present blindness of natural conscience makes this appear in a yet
          more glaring light; in the soul of the first man Adam, conscience was
          no doubt the candle of the Lord, and enabled him rightly and
          instantaneously to discern between good and evil, right and wrong.
          And, blessed be God! Some remains of this are yet left; but alas, how
          dimly does it burn, and how easily and quickly is it covered, or put
          out and extinguished. I need not send you to the heathen world, to
          learn the truth of this; you all know it by experience. Was there no
          other evidence, your own consciences are instead of a thousand
          witnesses, that man, as to his natural conscience, as well as
          understanding, will and affections, is much marred clay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does that great and boasted Diana, I mean unassisted unenlightened
          reason, less demonstrate the justness of such an assertion. Far be it
          from me to decry or exclaim against human reason. Christ himself is
          called the "Logos, the Reason;" and I believe it would not require
          much learning, or take up much time to prove, that so far and no
          farther than as we act agreeably to the laws of Christ Jesus, are we
          any way conformable to the laws of right reason. His service is
          therefore called "a reasonable service." And however his servants and
          followers may now be looked upon as fools and madmen; yet there will
          come a time, when those who despise and set themselves to oppose
          divine revelation, will find, that what they now call reason, is only
          reason depraved, and an utterly incapable, of itself, to guide us into
          the way of peace, or show the way of salvation, as the men of Sodom
          were to find Lot's door after they were struck with blindness by the
          angels, who came to lead him out of the city. The horrid and dreadful
          mistakes, which the most refined reasoners in the heathen world ran
          into, both as to the object, as well as manner of divine worship, have
          sufficiently demonstrated the weakness and depravity of human reason:
          nor do our modern boasters afford us any better proofs of the
          greatness of its strength, since the best improvement they generally
          make of it, is only to reason themselves into downright willful
          infidelity, and thereby reason themselves out of eternal salvation.
          Need we now any further witness, that man, fallen man, is altogether a
          piece of marred clay?
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not all, we have yet more evidence to call; for do the
          blindness of our understandings, the perverseness of our will, the
          rebellion of our affections, the corruption our consciences, the
          depravity of our reason prove this charge; and does not present
          disordered frame and constitution of our bodes confirm the same also?
          Doubtless in this respect, man, in the most literal sense of the word,
          is a piece of marred clay. For God originally made him of the "dust of
          the earth." So that notwithstanding our boasting of our high
          pedigrees, and different descent, we were all originally upon a level,
          and a little red earth was the common substratum out of which we were
          all formed. Clay indeed it was, but clay wonderfully modified, even by
          the immediate hands of the Creator of heaven and earth. One therefore
          hath observed, that it is said "God built the man;" he did not form
          him rashly or hastily, but built and finished him according to the
          plan before laid down in his own eternal mind. And though, as the
          great God is without body, parts, or passions, we cannot suppose when
          it is said "God made man after his own image," that it has any
          reference to his body, yet I cannot help thinking (with Doctor South)
          that as the eternal Logos was hereafter to appear, God manifest in the
          flesh, infinite wisdom was undoubtedly exerted in forming a casket
          into which so invaluable a pearl was in the fullness of time to be
          deposited. Some of the ancients are said to have asserted, that man at
          the first, had what we call a glory shining round him; but without
          attempting to be wise above what is written, we may venture to affirm,
          that he had a glorious body, which knowing no sin, knew neither
          sickness nor pain. But now on this, as well as other accounts, he may
          justly be called Ichabod; for its primitive strength and glory are
          sadly departed from it, and like the ruins of some ancient and stately
          fabric, only so much less as to give us some faint idea of what it was
          when it first appeared in its original and perfect beauty. The apostle
          Paul, therefore, who knew how to call things by their proper names, as
          well as any man living, does not scruple to term the human body,
          though in its original constitution fearfully and wonderfully made, a
          "vile body;" vile indeed! Since it is subject to such vile diseases,
          put to such vile, yea very vile uses, and at length is to come to so
          vile an end. "For dust we are, and to dust we must return." This among
          other considerations, we may well suppose, caused the blessed Jesus to
          weep at the grave of Lazarus. He wept, not only because his friend
          Lazarus was dead, but he wept to see human nature, through man's own
          default, thus laid in ruins, by being subject unto such a dissolution,
          made like unto the beasts that perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us here pause a while, and with our sympathizing Lord, see if we
          cannot shed a few silent tears at least, upon the same sorrowful
          occasion. Who, who is there amongst us, that upon such a melancholy
          review of man' present, real, and most deplorable depravity both in
          body and soul, can refrain from weeping over such a piece of marred
          clay? Who, who can help adopting holy David's lamentation over Saul
          and Jonathan? "How are the mighty fallen! How are they slain in their
          high places!" Originally it was not so. No, "God made man after his
          own image; in the image of God made he man." Never was there so much
          expressed in so few words. He was created after God in righteousness
          and true holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the account, which the sacred volume gives us of this
          interesting point. This, this is that blessed book, that book of
          books, from whence, together with an appeal to the experience of our
          own hearts, and the testimonies of all past ages, we have thought
          proper to fetch our proofs. For, after all, we must be obliged to
          divine revelation, to know what we were, what we are, and what we are
          to be. In these, as in a true glass, we may see our real and proper
          likeness. And from these only can we trace the source and fountain of
          all those innumerable evils, which like a deluge have overflowed the
          natural and moral world. If any should object against the authenticity
          of this revelation, and consequently against the doctrine this day
          drawn from thence, they do in my opinion thereby very much confirm it.
          For unless a man was very much disordered indeed, as to his
          understanding, will, affections, natural conscience, and his power of
          reasoning, he could never possibly deny such a revelation, which is
          founded on a multiplicity of infallible external evidences, hath so
          many internal evidences of a divine stamp in every page, is so suited
          to the common exigencies of all mankind, so agreeable to the
          experience of all men, and which hath been so wonderfully handed and
          preserved to us, hath been so instrumental to the convicting,
          converting, and comforting so many millions of souls, and hath stood
          the test of the most severe scrutinies, and exact criticisms of the
          most subtle and refined, as well as the most malicious and persecuting
          enemies, that ever lived, even from the beginning of time to this very
          day. Persons of such a turn of mind, I think, are rather to be prayed
          for, than disputed with, if so be this perverse wickedness of their
          hearts may be forgiven them: "They are in the very gall of bitterness,
          and must have their consciences seared as it were with a red-hot
          iron," and must have their eyes "blinded by the god of this world,"
          otherwise they could not but see, and feel, and assent to the truth of
          this doctrine, of man's being universally depraved; which not only in
          one or two, but in one or two thousands, in every page, I could almost
          say, is written, in such legible characters, that runs may read.
          Indeed, revelation itself is founded upon the doctrine of the fall.
          Had we kept our original integrity, the law of God would have yet been
          written in our hearts, and thereby the want of a divine revelation, at
          least such as ours, would have been superseded; but being fallen,
          instead of rising in rebellion against God, we ought to be filled with
          unspeakable thankfulness to our all bountiful Creator, who by a few
          lines in his own books hath discovered more to us, than all the
          philosophers and most learned men in the world could, or would, have
          discovered, though they had studied to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am well aware, that some who pretend to own the validity of divine
          revelation, are notwithstanding enemies to the doctrine that hath this
          day been delivered; and would fain elude the force of the proofs
          generally urged in defense of it, by saying, they only bespeak the
          corruption of particular persons, or have reference only to the
          heathen world: but such persons err, not knowing their own hearts, or
          the power of Jesus Christ: for by nature there is no difference
          between Jew or Gentile, Greek or Barbarian, bond or free. We are
          altogether equally become abominable in God's sight, all equally
          fallen short of the glory of God, and consequently all alike so many
          pieces of marred clay.
        </p>
        <p>
          How God came to suffer man to fall? how long man stood before he fell?
          And how the corruption contracted by the fall, is propagated to every
          individual of his species are questions of such an abstruse and
          critical nature, that should I undertake to answer them, would be only
          gratifying a sinful curiosity, and tempting you, as Satan tempted dour
          first parents, to eat forbidden fruit. It will much better answer the
          design of this present discourse, which is practical, to pass on
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To the next thing proposed, and point out to you the absolute
          necessity there is of this fallen nature's being renewed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This I have had all along in my eye, and on account of this, have
          purposely been so explicit on the first general head: for has
          Archimedes once said, "Give me a place where I may fix my foot, and I
          will move the world;" so without the least imputation of arrogance,
          with which, perhaps, he was justly chargeable, we may venture to say,
          grant the foregoing doctrine to be true, and then deny the necessity
          of man's being renewed who can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose, I may take it for granted, that all of you amongst whom I
          am now preaching the kingdom of God, hope after death to go to a place
          which we call Heaven. And my heart's desire and prayer to God for you
          is, that you all may have mansions prepared for you there. But give me
          leave to tell you, were you now to see these heavens opened, and the
          angel (to use the words of the seraphic Hervey clothed with all his
          heavenly drapery, with one foot upon the earth, and another upon the
          sea; nay, were you to see and hear the angel of the everlasting
          covenant, Jesus Christ himself, proclaiming "time shall be no more,"
          and giving you all an invitation immediately to come to heaven; heaven
          would be no heaven to you, nay it would be a hell to your souls,
          unless you were first prepared for a proper enjoyment of it here on
          earth. "For what communion hath light with darkness?" Or what
          fellowship could unrenewed sons of Belial possibly keep up with the
          pure and immaculate Jesus?
        </p>
        <p>
          The generality of people form strange ideas of heaven. And because the
          scriptures, in condescension to the weakness of our capacities,
          describe it by images taken from earthly delights and human grandeur,
          therefore they are apt to carry their thoughts no higher, and at the
          best only form to themselves a kind of Mahomitan paradise. But permit
          me to tell you, and God grant it may sink deep into your hearts!
          Heaven is rather a state than a place; and consequently, unless you
          are previously disposed by a suitable state of mind, you could not be
          happy even in heaven itself. For what is grace but glory militant?
          What is glory but grace triumphant? This consideration made a pious
          author say, that "holiness, happiness, and heaven, were only three
          different words for one and the self-same thing." And this made the
          great Preston, when he was about to die, turn to his friends, saying,
          "I am changing my place, but not my company." He had conversed with
          God and good men on earth; he was going to keep up the same, and
          infinitely more refined communion with God, his holy angels, and the
          spirits of just men made perfect, in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make us meet to be blissful partakers of such heavenly company,
          this "marred clay," I mean, these depraved natures of ours, must
          necessarily undergo an universal moral change; our understandings must
          be enlightened; our wills, reason, and consciences, must be renewed;
          our affections must be drawn toward, and fixed upon things above; and
          because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven, this
          corruptible must put on incorruption, this mortal must put on
          immortality. And thus old things must literally pass away, and behold
          all things, even the body as well as the faculties of the soul, must
          become new.
        </p>
        <p>
          This moral change is what some call, repentance, some, conversion,
          some, regeneration; choose what name you please, I only pray God, that
          we all may have the thing. The scriptures call it holiness,
          sanctification, the new creature, and our Lord calls it a "New birth,
          or being born again, or born from above." These are not barely
          figurative expressions, or the flights of eastern language, nor do
          they barely denote a relative change of state conferred on all those
          who are admitted into Christ's church by baptism; but they denote a
          real, moral change of heart and life, a real participation of the
          divine life in the soul of man. Some indeed content themselves with a
          figurative interpretation; but unless they are made to experience the
          power and efficacy thereof, by a solid living experience in their own
          souls, all their learning, all their labored criticism, will not
          exempt them from a real damnation. Christ hath said it, and Christ
          will stand, "Unless a man," learned or unlearned, high or low, though
          he be a master of Israel as Nicodemus was, unless he "be born again,
          he cannot see, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be inquired, who is to be the potter? And by whose agency this
          marred clay is to be formed into another vessel? Or in other words, if
          it be asked, how this great and mighty change is to be effected? I
          answer, not by the mere dint and force of moral suasion [persuasion].
          This is good in its place. And I am so far from thinking, that
          Christian preachers should not make use of rational arguments and
          motives in their sermons, that I cannot think they are fit to preach
          at all, who either cannot, or will not use them. We have the example
          of the great God himself for such a practice; "Come (says he) and let
          us reason together." And St. Paul, that prince of preachers, "reasoned
          of temperance, and righteousness, and a judgment to come." And it is
          remarkable, "that whilst he was reasoning of these things, Felix
          trembled." Nor are the most persuasive strains of holy rhetoric less
          needful for a scribe ready instructed to the kingdom of God. The
          scriptures both of the Old and New Testament, every where abound with
          them. And when can they be more properly employed, and brought forth,
          than when we are acting as ambassadors or heaven, and beseeching poor
          sinners, as in Christ's stead, to be reconciled unto God. All this we
          readily grant. But at the same time, I would as soon go to yonder
          church-yard, and attempt to raise the dead carcasses, with a "come
          forth," as to preach to dead souls, did I not hope for some superior
          power to make the word effectual to the designed end. I should only be
          like a sounding brass for any saving purpose, or as a tinkling cymbal.
          Neither is this change to be wrought by the power of our own
          free-will. This is an idol every where set up, but we dare not fall
          down and worship it. "No man (says Christ) can come to me, unless the
          Father draw him." Our own free-will, if improved, may restrain us from
          the commission of many evils, and put us in the way of conversion;
          but, after exerting our utmost efforts (and we are bound in duty to
          exert them) we shall find the words of our own church article to be
          true, that "man since the fall hath no power to turn to God." No, we
          might as soon attempt to stop the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and
          calm the most tempestuous sea, as to imagine that we can subdue, or
          bring under proper regulations, our own unruly wills and affections by
          any strength inherent in ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And therefore, that I may keep you no longer in suspense, I inform
          you, that this heavenly potter, this blessed agent, is the Almighty
          Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, the third person in the most adorable
          Trinity, coessential with the Father and the Son. This is that Spirit,
          which at the beginning of time moved on the face of the waters, when
          nature lay in one universal chaos. This was the Spirit that
          overshadowed the Holy Virgin, before that holy thing was born of her:
          and this same Spirit must come, and move upon the chaos of our souls,
          before we can properly be called the sons of God. This is what John
          the Baptist calls "being baptized with the Holy Ghost," without which,
          his and all other baptisms, whether infant or adult, avail nothing.
          This is that fire, which our Lord came to send into our earthly
          hearts, and which I pray the Lord of all lords to kindle in every
          unrenewed one this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the extraordinary operations of the Holy Ghost, such as working
          of miracles, or speaking with divers kinds of tongues, they are long
          since ceased. But as for this miracle of miracles, turning the soul to
          God by the more ordinary operations of the Holy Ghost, this abides
          yet, and will abide till time itself shall be nor more. For it is he
          that sanctifieth us, and all the elect people of God. On this account,
          true believers are said to be "born from above, to be born not of
          blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
          God." Their second, as well as their first creation, is truly and
          purely divine. It is, therefore, called "a creation;" but put ye on
          (says the apostle) the new man which is created" -- And how? Even as
          the first man was, "after God in righteousness and true holiness."
        </p>
        <p>
          These, these are the precious truths, which a scoffing world would
          fain rally or ridicule us out of. To produce this glorious change,
          this new creation, the glorious Jesus left his Father's bosom. For
          this he led a persecuted life; for this he died an ignominious and
          accursed death; for this he rose again; and for this he now sitteth at
          the right hand of his Father. All the precepts of his gospel, all his
          ordinances, all his providences, whether of an afflictive or
          prosperous nature, all divine revelation from the beginning to the
          end, all center in these two points, to show us how we are fallen, and
          to begin, early on, and complete a glorious and blessed change in our
          souls. This is an end worthy of the coming of so divine a personage.
          To deliver a multitude of souls of every nation, language and tongue,
          from so many moral evils, and to reinstate them in an incomparably
          more excellent condition than that from whence they are fallen, is an
          end worthy the shedding of such precious blood. What system of
          religion is there now, or was there ever exhibited to the world, any
          way to be compared to this? Can the deistical scheme pretend in any
          degree to come up to it? Is it not noble, rational, and truly divine?
          And why then will not all that hitherto are strangers to this blessed
          restoration of their fallen natures, (for my heart is too full to
          abstain any longer from an application) why will you any longer
          dispute or stand out against it? Why will you not rather bring your
          clay to this heavenly Potter, and say from your inmost souls, "Turn
          us, O good Lord, and so shall we be turned?" This, you may and can do:
          and if you go thus far, who knows but that this very day, yea this
          very hour, the heavenly Potter may take you in hand, and make you
          vessels of honor fit for the Redeemer's use? Others that were once as
          far from the kingdom of God as you are, have been partakers of this
          blessedness. What a wretched creature was Mary Magdalene? And yet out
          of her Jesus Christ cast seven devils. Nay, he appeared to her first,
          after he rose from the dead, and she became as it were an apostle to
          the very apostles. What a covetous creature was Zaccheus? He was a
          griping cheating publican; and yet, perhaps, in one quarter of an
          hour's time, his heart is enlarged, and he made quite willing to give
          half of his goods to feed the poor. And to mention no more, what a
          cruel person was Paul. He was a persecutor, a blasphemer, injurious;
          one that breathed out threatenings against the disciples of the Lord,
          and made havoc of the church of Christ. And yet what a wonderful turn
          did he meet with, as he was journeying to Damascus? From a persecutor,
          he became a preacher; was afterwards made a spiritual father to
          thousands, and now probably sits nearest the Lord Jesus Christ in
          glory. And why all this? That he might be made an example to them that
          should hereafter believe. O then believe, repent; I beseech you,
          believe the gospel. Indeed, it is glad tidings, even tidings of great
          joy. You will then no longer have any thing to say against the
          doctrine of Original Sin; or charge the Almighty foolishly, for
          suffering our first parents to be prevailed on to eat such sour
          grapes, and permitting thereby their children's teeth to be set on
          edge. You will then no longer cry out against the doctrine of the New
          Birth, as enthusiasm, or brand the assertors of such blessed truths
          with the opprobrious names of fools and madmen. Having felt, you will
          then believe; having believed, you will therefore speak; and instead
          of being vessels of wrath, and growing harder and harder in hell fire,
          like vessels in a potter's oven, you will be made vessels of honor,
          and be presented at the great day by Jesus, to his heavenly Father,
          and be translated to live with him as monuments of rich, free,
          distinguishing and sovereign grace, for ever and ever.

          You, that have in some degree experienced the quickening influence
          (for I must not conclude without dropping a word or two to God's
          children) you know how to pity, and therefore, I beseech you also to
          pray for those, to whose circumstances this discourse is peculiarly
          adapted. But will you be content in praying for them? Will you not see
          reason to pray for yourselves also? Yes, doubtless, for yourselves
          also. For you, and you only know, how much there is yet lacking in
          your faith, and how far you are from being partakers in that degree,
          which you desire to be, of the whole mind that was in Christ Jesus.
          You know what a body of sin and death you carry about with you, and
          that you must necessarily expect many turns of God's providence and
          grace, before you will be wholly delivered form it. But thanks be to
          God, we are in safe hands. He that has been the author, will also be
          the finisher of our faith. Yet a little while, and we like him shall
          say "It is finished;" we shall bow down our heads an give up the
          ghost. Till then, (for to thee, O Lord, will we now direct our prayer)
          help us, O Almighty Father, in patience to posses our souls. Behold,
          we are the clay, and thou art the Potter. Let not the thing formed say
          to him that formed it, whatever the dispensations of thy future Will
          concerning us may be, Why dost thou deal with us thus? Behold, we put
          ourselves as blanks in thine hands, deal with us as seemeth good in
          thy sight, only let every cross, ever affliction, every temptation, be
          overruled to the stamping thy blessed image in more lively characters
          on our hearts; that so passing from glory to glory, by the powerful
          operations of they blessed Spirit, we may be made thereby more and
          more meet for, and at last be translated to a full, perfect, endless,
          and uninterrupted enjoyment of glory hereafter, with thee O Father,
          thee O Son, and thee O blessed Spirit; to whom, three persons but one
          God, be ascribed, as is most due, all honor, power, might, majesty and
          dominion, now and to all eternity. Amen and Amen.<br />
