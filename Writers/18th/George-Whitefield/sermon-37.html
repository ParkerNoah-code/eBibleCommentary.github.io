          John 2:11 -- "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,
          and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have more than once had occasion to observe, that the chief end St.
          John had in view, when he wrote his gospel, was to prove the divinity
          of Jesus Christ, [that Word, who not only was from everlasting with
          God, but also was really God blessed for evermore] against those
          arch-heretics Ebion and Cerinthus, whose pernicious principles too
          many follow in these last days. For this purpose, you may take notice,
          that he is more particular than any other Evangelist, in relating our
          Lord's divine discourses, and also the glorious miracles which he
          wrought, not by a power derived from another, like Moses, and other
          prophets, but from a power inherent in himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of the text have a reference to a notable miracle which
          Christ performed, and thereby gave proof of his eternal power and
          Godhead. "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
          manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
        </p>
        <p>
          The miracle here spoken of, is that of our Lord's turning water into
          wine at a marriage feast. I design, at present, by God's help, to make
          some observations on the circumstances and certainty of the miracle,
          and then conclude with some practical instructions; that you, by
          hearing how Jesus Christ has showed forth his glory, may, by the
          operation of God's Spirit upon your hearts, with the disciples
          mentioned in the text, be brought to believe on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, I would make some observations on the miracle itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verse 1 and 2. "And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of
          Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called,
          and his disciples, to the marriage." By our Lord's being at a feast we
          may learn, that feasting upon solemn occasions is not absolutely
          unlawful: but then we must be exceeding careful at such seasons, that
          the occasion be solemn, and that we go not for the sake of eating and
          drinking, but to edify one another in love. Feasting in any other
          manner, I think absolutely unlawful for the followers of Jesus Christ:
          because if we eat and drink out of any other view, it cannot be to the
          glory of God. The Son of man, we know, "came eating and drinking." If
          a Pharisee asked him to come to his house, our Lord went, and sat down
          with him. But then we find his discourse was always such as tended to
          the use of edifying. We may then, no doubt, go and do likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe farther, that if our Lord was present at a marriage
          feast, then, to deny marriage to any order of men, is certainly a
          "doctrine of devils." "Marriage (says the Apostle) is honorable in
          all." Our Lord graced a marriage feast with his first public miracle.
          It was an institution of God himself, even in paradise: and therefore,
          no doubt, lawful for all Christians, even for those who are made
          perfect in holiness through the faith of Jesus Christ. But then, we
          may learn the reason why we have so many unhappy marriages in the
          world; it is because the parties concerned do not call Jesus Christ by
          prayer, nor ask the advice of his true disciples when they are about
          to marry. No; Christ and religion are the last things that are
          consulted; and no wonder then if matches of the devil's making (as all
          such are, which are contracted only on account of outward beauty, or
          for filthy lucre's sake) prove most miserable, and grievous to be
          borne.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot but dwell a little on this particular, because I am persuaded
          the devil cannot lay a greater snare for young Christians, than to
          tempt them unequally to yoke themselves with unbelievers; as are all
          who are not born again of God. This was the snare wherein the sons of
          God were entangled before the flood, and one great cause why God
          brought that flood upon the world. For what says Moses, Gen 6:2, 3,
          "The sons of God (the posterity of pious Seth) saw the daughters of
          men, (or the posterity of wicked Cain) that they were fair, (not that
          they were pious) and they took them wives of all which they chose:"
          not which God chose for them. What follows? "And the Lord saith, My
          spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh;"
          that is, even the few righteous souls being now grown carnal by their
          ungodly marriages, the whole world was altogether become abominable,
          and had made themselves vessels of wrath fitted for destruction. I
          might instance farther, the care the ancient patriarchs took to choose
          wives for their children out of their own religious families, and it
          was one great mark of Esau's rebellion against his father, that he
          took unto himself wives of the daughters of the Canaanites, who were
          strangers to the covenant of promise made unto his fathers. But I
          forbear. Time will not permit me to enlarge here. Let it suffice to
          advise all, whenever they enter into a marriage state, to imitate the
          people of Cana in Galilee, to call Christ to the marriage; He
          certainly will hear and choose for you; and you will always find his
          choice to be the best. He then will direct you to such yoke-fellows as
          shall be helps meet for you in the great work of your salvation, and
          then he will also enable you to serve him without distraction, and
          cause you to walk, as Zachary and Elizabeth, in all his commandments
          and ordinances blameless.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to proceed. Who these persons were that called our Lord and his
          disciples to the marriage, is not certain. Some (because it is said,
          that the mother of Jesus was there) have supposed that they were
          related to the Virgin, and that therefore our Lord and his disciples
          were invited on her account. However that be, it should seem they were
          not very rich, (for what had rich folks to do with a despised Jesus of
          Nazareth, and his mean followers?) because we find they were
          unfurnished with a sufficient quantity of wine for a large company,
          and therefore, "when they wanted wind, the mother of Jesus," having,
          as it should seem by her applying to him so readily on this occasion,
          even in his private life, seen some instances of his miraculous power,
          "saith unto him, They have no wine." She thought is sufficient only to
          inform him of the wants of the host, knowing that he was as ready to
          give as she to ask. In this light the blessed Virgin's request appears
          to us at the first view; but if we examine our Lord's answer, we shall
          have reason to think there was something which was not right; for
          Jesus saith unto her, ver.4, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?"
          Observe, he calls her woman, not mother; to show her, that though she
          was his mother, as he was man, yet she was his creature, as he was
          God. "What have I to do with thee?" Think you that I must work
          miracles at your bidding? Some have thought that she spoke as though
          she had an authority over him, which was a proud motion, and our Lord
          therefore checks her for it, And if Jesus Christ would not turn a
          little water into wine, whilst he was here on earth, at her command,
          how idolatrous is that church, and how justly do we separate from her,
          which prescribes forms, wherein the Virgin is desired to command her
          Son to have compassion on us!
        </p>
        <p>
          But notwithstanding the holy Virgin was blamable in this respect, yet
          she hath herein set rich and poor an example which it is your duty to
          follow. You that are rich, and live in cieled houses, learn of her to
          go into the cottages of the poor; your Lord was not above it, and why
          should you? And when you do visit them, like the virgin-mother,
          examine their wants; and when you see they have no wine, and are ready
          to perish with hunger, shut not up your bowels of compassion, but
          bless the Lord for putting it in your power to administer to their
          necessities. Believe me, such visits would do you good. You would
          learn then to be thankful that God has given you bread enough, and to
          spare. And I am persuaded, every mite that you bestow on feeding the
          hungry and clothing the naked disciples of Jesus Christ, will afford
          you more satisfaction at the hour of death, and in the day of
          judgment, than all the thousands squandered away in balls and
          assemblies, and such like entertainments.
        </p>
        <p>
          You that are poor in this world's goods, and thereby are disabled from
          helping, yet you may learn from the Virgin, to pray for one another.
          She could not turn the water into wine, but she could entreat her son
          to do it: and so may you; and doubt not of the Lord's hearing you; for
          God has chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith: and by your
          servant prayers, you may draw down many a blessing on your poor fellow
          creatures. O that I may ever be remembered by you before the throne of
          our dear Lord Jesus! But what shall we say? Will our Lord entirely
          disregard this motion of his mother? No; though he check her with,
          "Woman, what have I to do with thee?" yet he intimates that he would
          do as she desired by-and-by; "Mine hour is not yet come." As though he
          had said, The wine is almost, but not quite out; when they are come to
          an extremity, and sensible of the want of my assistance, then will I
          show forth my glory, that they may behold it, and believe on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, Sirs, hath our Lord been frequently pleased to deal with me,
          and, I doubt not, with many of you also. Often, often when I have
          found his presence as it were hidden from my soul, and his comforts
          well nigh gone, I have went unto him complaining that I had no visit
          and token of his love, as usual. Sometimes he has seemed to turn a
          deaf ear to my request, and as it were said, "What have I to do with
          thee?" which has made me go sorrowing all the day long; so foolish was
          I, and faithless before him: for I have always found he loved me
          notwithstanding, as he did Lazarus, though he stayed two days after he
          heard he was sick. But when my hour of extremity has been come, and my
          will broken, then hath he lifted up the light of his blessed
          countenance afresh; he has showed forth his glory, and made me ashamed
          for disbelieving him, who often hath turned my water into wine. Be not
          then discouraged, if the Lord does not immediately seem to regard the
          voice of your prayer, when you cry unto him. The holy Virgin we find
          was not; no, she was convinced his time was the best time, and
          therefore, verse 5, "saith unto the servants, (O that we could follow
          her advice!) whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, behold the hour is come, when the eternal Son of God will
          show forth his glory. The circumstance of the miracle is very
          remarkable; ver.6, "And there were set six water-pots of water, after
          the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
          firkins a-piece." The manner of this purifying we have an account of
          in the other Evangelist, especially St. Mark, who informs us, that the
          Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat
          not; and when they come from the market, except they wash they eat
          not. This was a superstitious custom; but, however , we may learn from
          it, whenever we come in from conversing with those that are without,
          to purify our hearts by self-examination and prayer; for it is hard to
          go through the world, and to be kept unspotted from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe further, verse 7. "Jesus saith unto them," not to his own
          disciples, but unto the servants of the house, who were strangers to
          the holy Jesus, and whom the virgin had before charged to do
          whatsoever he said unto them; "Fill the water-pots with water. And
          they filled them to the brim. And he saith unto them, draw out now,
          and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bear it." How our Lord
          turned the water into wine we are not told. What have we to do with
          that? Why should we desire to be wise above what is written? It is
          sufficient for the manifestation of his glorious godhead, that we are
          assured he did do it. For we are told, verse 9, 10, "When the ruler of
          the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence
          it was (but the servants that drew the water knew) the governor of the
          feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, every man at the
          beginning doth set forth good wine, and when they have well drank,
          that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now."
        </p>
        <p>
          To explain this passage, you must observe, it was the custom of the
          Jews, nay even of the heathens themselves, (to the shame of our
          Christian baptized heathens be it spoken) at their public feasts to
          choose a governor, who was to ever see and regulate the behavior of
          the guests, and to take care that all things were carried on with
          decency and order. To this person then did the servants bear the wine;
          and we may judge how rich it was by his commendation of it, "Every man
          at the beginning, &amp;c." Judge ye then, whether Jesus did not show
          forth his glory, and whether you have not good reason, like the
          disciple here mentioned, to believe on him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, my brethren, I have endeavored to make some observations on the
          miracle itself. But alas! this is only the outward court thereof, the
          veil is yet before our eyes; turn that aside, and we shall see such
          mysteries under it, as will make our hearts to dance for joy, and fill
          our mouths with praise for evermore!
        </p>
        <p>
          But here I cannot help remarking what a sad inference one of our
          masters of Israel, in a printed sermon, has lately drawn from this
          commendation of the bridegroom. His words are these. "Our blessed
          Savior came eating and drinking, was present at weddings, and other
          entertainments, (though I hear of his being only at one;) nay, at one
          of them (which I suppose is that of which I am now discoursing) worked
          a miracle to make wine, when it is plain there had been more drank
          than was absolutely necessary for the support of nature, and
          consequently something had been indulged to pleasure and
          cheerfulness."
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sorry such words should come from the mouth and pen of a
          dignified clergyman of the Church of England. Alas! how is she fallen!
          or at least, in what danger must her tottering ark be, when such
          unhallowed hands are stretched out to support it! Well may I bear
          patiently to be stiled a blasphemer, and a setter forth of strange
          doctrine, when my dear Lord Jesus is thus traduced; and when those who
          pretend to preach in his name, urge this example to patronize
          licentiousness and excess. It is true (as I observed at the beginning
          of this discourse) our blessed Savior did come eating and drinking; he
          was present at a wedding, and other entertainments; nay, at one of
          them worked a miracle to make wine, (you see I have been making some
          observations on it) but then it is not plain there had been more wine
          drank than was absolutely necessary for the support of nature; much
          less does it appear, that something had been indulged to pleasure and
          cheerfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The governor does indeed say, "When men have well drunken," but it no
          where appears that they were the men. Is it to be supposed, that the
          most holy and unspotted Lamb of God, who was manifested to destroy the
          works of the devil, and who, when at a Pharisee's house, took notice
          of even the gestures of those with whom he sat at meat; is it to be
          supposed, that our dear Redeemer, whose constant practice it was to
          tell people they must deny themselves, and take up their crosses
          daily; who bid his disciples to take heed, lest at any time their
          hearts might be over-charged with surfeiting and drunkenness; can it
          be supposed, that such a self-denying Jesus should now turn six large
          water-pots of water into the richest wine, to encourage excess and
          drunkenness in persons, who, according to this writer, had indulged to
          pleasure and cheerfulness already? Had our Lord sat by, and seen them
          indulge, without telling them of it, would it not be a sin? But to
          insinuate he not only did this, but also turned water into wine, to
          increase that indulgence; this is making Christ a minister of sin
          indeed. What is this, but using him like the Pharisees of old, who
          called him a glutton, and a wine-bibber? Alas! how may we expect our
          dear Lord's enemies will treat him, when he is thus wounded in the
          house of his seeming friends? Sirs, if you follow such doctrine as
          this, you will not be righteous, but I am persuaded you will be wicked
          over-much.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God forbid you should think our Lord behaved so much unlike
          himself in this matter. No, he had nobler ends in view, when he
          wrought this miracle. One, the evangelist mentions in the words of the
          text, "to show forth his glory," or to give a proof of his eternal
          power and godhead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here seems to be an allusion to the appearance of God in the
          tabernacle, which this same evangelist takes notice of in his first
          chapter, where he says, "The Word (Jesus Christ) was made flesh, and
          dwelt (or, as it is rendered in the margin, tabernacled) amongst us."
          Our dear Lord, though very God of very God, and also most perfect and
          glorious in himself as man, was pleased to throw a veil of flesh over
          this his great glory, when he came to make his soul an offering for
          sin. And that the world might know and believe in him as the Savior of
          all men, he performed many miracles, and this in particular; for thus
          speaks the evangelist, "This first," &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then was the chief design of our Lord's turning the water into
          wine. But there are more which our Lord may be supposed to have had in
          view, some of which I shall proceed to mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he might do this to reward the hose for calling him and his
          disciples to the marriage. Jesus Christ will not be behind-hand with
          those who receive him or his followers, for his name's sake. Those who
          thus honor him, he will honor. A cup of cold water given in the name
          of a disciple, shall in no wise lose its reward. He will turn water
          into wine. Though those who abound in alms-deeds, out of a true faith
          in, and love for Jesus, may seem as it were to throw their bread upon
          the waters, yet they shall find it again after many days. For they who
          give to the poor out of this principle, lend unto the Lord; and look,
          whatsoever they lay out, it shall be repaid them again. Even in this
          life, God often orders good measure pressed down and running over, to
          be returned into his servants bosoms. It is the same in spirituals. To
          him that hath, and improves what he hath, for the sake of Christ and
          his disciples, shall be given, and he shall have abundance. Brethren,
          I would not boast; but, to my master's honor and free grace be it
          spoken, I can prove this to be true by happy experience. When I have
          considered that I am a child, and cannot speak, and have seen so many
          of you come out into the wilderness to be fed, I have often said
          within myself, what can I do with my little stock of grace and
          knowledge among so great a multitude? But, at my Lord's command, I
          have given you to eat of such spiritual food as I had, and before I
          have done speaking, have had my soul richly fed with the bread which
          cometh down from heaven. Thus shall it be done to all such who are
          willing to spend and be spent for Christ or his disciples; for there
          is no respect of persons with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Our Lord's turning the water, which was poured out so
          plentifully, into wine, is a sign of the plentiful pouring out of his
          Spirit into the hearts of believers. The holy Spirit is in scripture
          compared unto wine; and therefore the prophet calls us to buy wine as
          well as milk, that is, the spirit of love, which fills and gladdens
          the soul as it were with new wine. The apostle alludes to this, when
          he bids the Ephesians "not to be drunk with wine, wherein is excess,
          but be filled with the Spirit." And our Lord shows us thus much by
          choosing wine; to show forth the strength and refreshment of his
          blood, in the blessed sacrament. I know these terms are unintelligible
          to natural men, they can no more understand me, than if I spoke to
          them in an unknown tongue, for they are only to be spiritually
          discerned. To you then that are spiritual do I speak, to you who are
          justified by faith, and feel the blessed Spirit of Jesus Christ
          working upon your hearts, you can judge of what I say; you have
          already (I am persuaded) been as it were filled with new wine by the
          inspiration of his Holy Spirit. But alas! you have not yet had half
          your portion; thee are only earnests, and in comparison but shadows of
          good things to come; our Lord keeps his best wine for you till the
          last; and though you have drank deep of it already, yet he intends to
          give you more: He will not leave you, till he has filled you to the
          brim, till you are ready to cry out, Lord, stay thine hand, thy poor
          creatures can hold no more! Be not straitened in your own bowels,
          since Jesus Christ is not straitened in his. Open your hearts as wide
          as ever you will, the Spirit of the Lord shall fill them. Christ deals
          with true believers, as Elijah did with the poor woman, whose oil
          increased, to pay her husband's debts; as long as she brought
          pitchers, the oil continued. It did not cease till she ceased bringing
          vessels to contain it. My brethren, our hearts are like those
          pitchers; open them freely by faith, and the oil of God's free gift,
          the oil of gladness, the love of God through Christ, shall be
          continually pouring in; for believers are to be filled with all the
          fullness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Our Lord's turning water into wine, and keeping the best
          until last, may show forth the glory of the latter days of his
          marriage feast with his church. Great things God has done already,
          whereat millions of saints have rejoiced, and do yet rejoice. Great
          things God is doing now, but yet, my brethren, we shall see greater
          things than these. It is meet, right, and our bounden duty, to give
          thanks unto God, even the Father; for many righteous men have desired
          to see the things which we see, and have not seen them; and to hear
          the things which we hear, and have not heard them. But still there are
          more excellent things behind. Glorious things are spoken of these
          times, "when the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord,
          as the waters cover the sea." There is a general expectation among the
          people of God, when the partition-wall between Jew and Gentile shall
          be broken down, and all Israel be saved. Happy those who live when God
          does this. They shall see Satan, like lightning, fall from heaven.
          They shall not weep, as the Jews did at the building of the second
          temple. No, they shall rejoice with exceeding great joy. For all the
          former glory of the Christian church shall be nothing in comparison of
          that glory which shall excel. Then shall they cry out with the
          governor of the feast, "thou hast kept thy good wine until now!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, and lastly, This shows us the happiness of that blessed
          state, when we shall all sit together at the marriage supper of the
          Lamb, and drink of the new wine in his eternal and glorious kingdom!
        </p>
        <p>
          The rewards which Jesus Christ confers on his faithful servants, and
          the comforts of his love wherewith he comforts them, whilst pilgrims
          here on earth, are often so exceeding great, that was it not promised,
          it were almost presumption for them to hope for any reward hereafter.
          But, my brethren, all the manifestations of God that we can possibly
          be favored with here, when compared with the glory that is to be
          revealed in us, are no more than a drop of water when compared with an
          unbounded ocean. Though Christ frequently fills his saints even to the
          brim, yet their corruptible bodies weigh down their souls, and cause
          them to cry, "Who shall deliver us from these bodies of death?" These
          earthly tabernacles can hold no more: But, blessed be God, these
          earthly tabernacles are to be dissolved; this corruptible is to put on
          incorruption; this mortal is to put on immortality: and when God shall
          cause all his glory to pass before us, then shall we cry out, Lord,
          thou hast kept thy good wine until now. We have drank deeply of thy
          spirit; we have heard glorious things spoken of this thy city, O God!
          but we now find, that not the half, not the thousandth part hath been
          told us. O the invisible realities of the world of faith! Eye hath not
          seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of
          the greatest saint to conceive how Christ will show forth his glory
          there! St. Paul, who was carried up into the third heavens, could give
          us little or no account of it. And well he might not -- for he heard
          and saw such things as is not possible for a man clothed with flesh
          and blood to utter. Whilst I am thinking, and only speaking of those
          things unto you, I am almost carried beyond myself. Methinks, I now
          receive some little foretastes of that new wine which I hope to drink
          with you in the heavenly kingdom for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          And wherefore do you think I have been saying these things? Many,
          perhaps, may be ready to say, To manifest thy own vain-glory. But it
          is a small matter with me to be judged of man's judgment. He that
          judgeth me is the Lord. He knows that I have spoken of his miracle,
          only for the same end for which he at first performed it, and which I
          at first proposed, that is, "to show forth his glory," that you also
          may be brought to believe on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did I come to preach myself, and not Christ Jesus my Lord, I would
          come to you, not in this plainness of speech, but with the enticing
          words of man's wisdom. Did I desire to please natural men, I need not
          preach here in the wilderness. I hope my heart aims at nothing else,
          than what our Lord's great fore-runner aimed at, and which ought to be
          the business of every gospel minister, that is, to point out to you
          the God-man Christ Jesus. "Behold then (by faith behold) the Lamb of
          God, who taketh away the sins of the world." Look unto him, and be
          saved. You have heard how he manifested, and will yet manifest his
          glory to true believers; and why then, O sinners, will you not believe
          in him? I say, O sinners, for now I have spoken to the saints, I have
          many things to say to you. And may God give you all an hearing ear,
          and an obedient heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus who showed forth his glory above 1700 years ago, has
          made a marriage feast, and offers to espouse all sinners to himself,
          and to make them flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. He is
          willing to be united to you by one spirit. In every age, at sundry
          times, and after divers manners, he hath sent forth his servants, and
          they had bidden many, but yet, my brethren, there is room. The Lord
          therefore now has given a commission in these last days to others of
          his servants, even to compel poor sinners by the cords of love to come
          in. For our master's house must and shall be filled. He will not shed
          his gracious blood in vain. Come then, come to the marriage. Let this
          be the day of your espousals with Jesus Christ, he is willing to
          receive you, though other lords have had dominion over you. Come then
          to the marriage. Behold the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all
          things are ready; let me hear you say, as Rebecca did, when they asked
          her, whether she would go and be a wife to Isaac; O let me hear you
          say, we will come. Indeed you will not repent it. The Lord shall turn
          your water into wine. He shall fill your souls with marrow and
          fatness, and cause you to praise him with joyful lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not say, you are miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and
          therefore ashamed to come, for it is to such that this invitation is
          not sent. The polite, the rich, the busy, self-righteous Pharisees of
          this generation have been bidden already, but they have rejected the
          counsel of God against themselves. They are too deeply engaged in
          going, one to his country house, another to his merchandise. They are
          so deeply wedded to the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, that
          they, as it were with one consent, have made excuse. And though they
          have been often called in their own synagogues, yet all the return
          they make, is to thrust us out, and thereby in effect say, they will
          not come. But God forbid, my brethren, that you should learn of them;
          no, since our Lord condescends to call first, (because if left to
          yourselves you would never call after him) let me beseech you to
          answer him, as he answered for you, when called upon by infinite
          offended justice to die for you sins, "Lo! I come to do thy will, O
          God!" What if you are miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, that
          is no excuse; faith is the only wedding garment which Christ requires;
          he does not call you because you already are, but because he intends
          to make you saints. It pities him to see you naked. He wants to cover
          you with his righteousness. In short, he desires to show forth his
          glory, that is, his free love through your faith in him. Not but that
          he will be glorified, whether you believe in him or not; for the
          infinitely free love of Jesus Christ will be ever the same, whether
          you believe it, or so receive it, or the contrary. But our Lord will
          not always send out his servants in vain, to call you; the time will
          come when he will say, None of those which were bidden, and would not
          come, shall taste of my supper. Our Lord is a God of justice, as well
          as of love; and if sinners will not take hold of his golden scepter,
          verily he will bruise them with his iron rod. It is for your sakes, O
          sinners, and not his own, that he thus condescends to invite you:
          suffer him then to show forth his glory, even the glory of the
          exceeding riches of his free grace, by believing on him, "For we are
          saved by grace through faith." It was grace, free grace, that moved
          the Father so to love the world, as to "give his only begotten Son,
          that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
          everlasting life!" It was grace, that made the Son to come down and
          die. It was grace, free grace, that moved the Holy Ghost to undertake
          to sanctify the elect people of God: and it was grace, free grace,
          that moved our Lord Jesus Christ to send forth his ministers to call
          poor sinners this day. Let me not then, my brethren, go without my
          errand. Why will you not believe in him? Will the devil do such great
          and good things for you as Christ will? No indeed, he will not.
          Perhaps, he may give you to drink at first of a little brutish
          pleasure; but what will he give you to drink as last? a cup of fury
          and of trembling; a never-dying worm, a self-condemning conscience,
          and the bitter pains of eternal death. But as for the servants of
          Jesus Christ, it is not so with them. No, he keeps his best wine till
          the last. And though he may cause you to drink of the brook in the way
          to heaven, and of the cup of affliction, yet he sweetens it with a
          sense of his goodness, and makes it pleasant drink, such as their
          souls do love. I appeal to the experience of any saint here present,
          (as I doubt not but there are many such in this field) whether Christ
          has not proved faithful, ever since you have been espoused to him? Has
          he not showed forth his glory, ever since you have believed on him?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, sinners, what have you to object? I see you are all silent,
          and well you may. For if you will not be drawn by the cords of
          infinite and everlasting love, what will draw you? I could urge many
          terrors of the Lord to persuade you; but if the love of Jesus Christ
          will not constrain you, your case is desperate. Remember then this day
          I have invited all, even the worst of sinners, to be married to the
          Lord Jesus. If you perish, remember you do not perish for lack of
          invitation. You yourselves shall stand forth at the last day, and I
          here give you a summons to meet me at the judgment seat of Christ, and
          to clear both my master and me. Would weeping, would tears prevail on
          you, I could wish my head were waters, and my eyes fountains of tears,
          that I might weep out every argument, and melt you into love. Would
          any thing I could do or suffer, influence your hearts, I think I could
          bear to pluck out my eyes, or even to lay down my life for your sakes.
          Or was I sure to prevail on you by importunity, I could continue my
          discourse till midnight, I would wrestle with you even till the
          morning watch, as Jacob did with the angel, and would not go away till
          I had overcome. But such power belongeth only unto the Lord, I can
          only invite; it is He only can work in you both to will and to do
          after his good pleasure; it is his property to take away the heart of
          stone, and give you a heart of flesh; it is his spirit that must
          convince you of unbelief, and of the everlasting righteousness of his
          dear Son; it is He alone must give faith to apply his righteousness to
          your hearts; it is He alone can give you a wedding garment, and bring
          you to sit down and drink new wine in his kingdom. As to spirituals we
          are quite dead, and have no more power to turn to God of ourselves,
          than Lazarus had to raise himself, after he had lain stinking in the
          grave four days. If thou canst go, O man, and breathe upon all the dry
          bones that lie in the graves, and bid them live; if thou canst take
          thy mantle and divide yonder river, as Elijah did the river Jordan;
          then will we believe thou hast a power to turn to God of thyself: But
          as thou must despair of the one, so thou must despair of the other,
          without Christ's quickening grace; in him is thy only help; fly to him
          then by faith; say unto him, as the poor leper did, "Lord, if thou
          wilt," thou canst make me willing; and he will stretch forth the
          right-hand of his power to assist and relieve you: He will sweetly
          guide you by his wisdom on earth, and afterwards take you up to
          partake of his glory in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          To his mercy therefore, and Almighty protection, do I earnestly,
          humbly, and most affectionately commit you: the Lord bless you and
          keep you; the Lord lift up the light of his blessed countenance upon
          you, and give you all peace and joy in believing, now and for
          evermore!
