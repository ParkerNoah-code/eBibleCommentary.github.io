          FULL TEXT: Genesis 22:1-12<br />
          <br />
          The great Apostle Paul, in one of his epistles, informs us, that
          "whatsoever was written aforetime was written for our learning, that
          we through patience and comfort of the holy scripture might have
          hope." And as without faith it is impossible to please God, or be
          accepted in Jesus, the Son of his love; we may be assured, that
          whatever instances of a more than common faith are recorded in the
          book of God, they were more immediately designed by the Holy Spirit
          for our learning and imitation, upon whom the ends of the world are
          come. For this reason, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, in
          the 11th chapter, mentions such a noble catalogue of Old Testament
          saints and martyrs, "who subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
          stopped the mouths of lions, etc. and are gone before us to inherit
          the promises." A sufficient confutation, I think, of their error, who
          lightly esteem the Old Testament saints, and would not have them
          mentioned to Christians, as persons whose faith and patience we are
          called upon more immediately to follow. If this was true, the apostle
          would never have produced such a cloud of witnesses out of the Old
          Testament, to excite the Christians of the first, and consequently
          purest age of the church, to continue steadfast and unmoveable in the
          profession of their faith. Amidst this catalogue of saints, methinks
          the patriarch Abraham shines the brightest, and differs from the
          others, as one star differeth from another star in glory; for he shone
          with such distinguished luster, that he was called the "friend of
          God," the "father of the faithful;" and those who believe on Christ,
          are said to be "sons and daughters of, and to be blessed with,
          faithful Abraham." Many trials of his faith did God send this great
          and good man, after he had commanded him to get out from his country,
          and from his kindred, unto a land which he should show him; but the
          last was the most sever of all, I mean, that of offering up his only
          son. This, by the divine assistance, I propose to make the subject of
          your present meditation, and, by way of conclusion, to draw some
          practical inferences, as God shall enable me, from this instructive
          story.<br />
          <br />
          The sacred penman begins the narrative thus; verse 1. "And it came to
          pass, after these things, God did tempt Abraham." After these things,
          that it, after he had underwent many severe trials before, after he
          was old, full of days, and might flatter himself perhaps that the
          troubles and toils of life were now finished; "after these things, God
          did tempt Abraham." Christians, you know not what trials you may meet
          with before you die: notwithstanding you may have suffered, and been
          tried much already, yet, it may be, a greater measure is still behind,
          which you are to fill up. "Be not high-minded, but fear." Our last
          trials, in all probability, will be the greatest: and we can never say
          our warfare is accomplished, or our trials finished, till we bow down
          our heads, and give up the ghost. "And it came to pass, after these
          things, that God did tempt Abraham."<br />
          <br />
          "God did tempt Abraham." But can the scripture contradict itself? Does
          not the apostle James tell us, "that God tempts no man;" and God does
          tempt no man to evil, or on purpose to draw him into sin; for, when a
          man is thus tempted, he is drawn away of his own heart's lust, and
          enticed. But in another sense, God may be said to tempt, I mean, to
          try his servants; and in this sense we are to understand that passage
          of Matthew, where we are told, that, "Jesus was led up by the Spirit
          (the good Spirit) into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil."
          And our Lord, in that excellent form of prayer which he has been
          pleased to give us, does not require us to pray that we may not
          absolutely be led into temptation, but delivered from the evil of it;
          whence we may plainly infer, that God sees it fit sometimes to lead us
          into temptation, that is, to bring us into such circumstances as will
          try our faith and other Christian graces. In this sense we are to
          understand the expression before us; "God did tempt or try
          Abraham."<br />
          <br />
          How God was pleased to reveal his will at this time to his faithful
          servant, whether by the Sheckinah, or divine appearance, or by a small
          still voice, as he spoke to Elijah, or by a whisper, like that of the
          Spirit to Philip, when he commanded him to join himself to the
          eunuch's chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to inquire. It
          is enough that we are informed, God said unto him, Abraham; and that
          Abraham knew it was the voice of God: for he said, "Behold, here I
          am." O what a holy familiarity (if I may so speak) is there between
          God and those holy souls that are united to him by faith in Christ
          Jesus! God says, Abraham; and Abraham said (it should seem without the
          least surprise) Behold, here I am. Being reconciled to God by the
          death and obedience of Christ, which he rejoiced in, and saw by faith
          afar off; he did not, like guilty Adam, seed the trees of the garden
          to hide himself from, but takes pleasure in conversing with God, and
          talketh with him, as a man talketh with his friend. O that Christ-less
          sinners knew what it is to have fellowship with the Father and the
          Son! They would envy the happiness of saints, and count it all joy to
          be termed enthusiasts and fools for Christ's sake.<br />
          <br />
          But what does God say to Abraham? Verse 2. "Take now thy son, thine
          only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of
          Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the
          mountains which I shall tell thee of."<br />
          <br />
          Every word deserves our particular observation. Whatever he was to do,
          he must do it now, immediately, without conferring with flesh and
          blood. But what must he do? "Take now thy son." Had God said, take now
          a firstling, or choicest lamb or beast of thy flock, and offer it up
          for a burnt-offering, it would not have appeared so ghastly; but for
          God to say, "take now thy son, and offer him up for a burnt-offering,"
          one would imagine, was enough to stagger the strongest faith. But this
          is not all: it must not only be a son, but "thine only son Isaac, whom
          thou lovest." If it must be a son, and not a beast, that must be
          offered, why will not Ishmael do, the son of the bond-woman? No, it
          must be his only son, the heir of all, his Isaac, by interpretation
          laughter, the son of his old age, in whom his soul delighted, "whom
          thou lovest," says God, in whose life his own was wrapped up: and this
          son, this only son, this Isaac, the son of his love, must be taken
          now, even now, without delay, and be offered up by his own father, for
          a burnt offering, upon one of the mountains of the which God would
          tell him.<br />
          <br />
          Well might the apostle, speaking of this man of God, say, that
          "against hope he believed in hope, and, being strong in faith, gave
          glory to God." For, had he not been blesses with faith which man never
          before had, he must have refused to comply with this severe command.
          For now many arguments might nature suggest, to prove that such a
          command could never come from God, or to excuse himself from obeying
          it? "What! (might the good man have said) butcher my own child! It is
          contrary to the very law of nature: much more to butcher my dear son
          Isaac, in whose seed God himself has assured me of a numerous
          posterity. But supposing I could give up my own affections, and be
          willing to part with him, though I love him so dearly, yet, if I
          murder him, what will become of God's promise? Besides, I am now like
          a city built upon a hill; I shine as a light in the world, in the
          midst of a crooked and perverse generation: How then shall I cause
          God's name to be blasphemed, how shall I become a by-word among the
          heathen, if they hear that I have committed a crime which they abhor!
          But, above all, what will Sarah my wife say? How can I ever return to
          her again, after I have imbrued (to wet or stain) my hands in my dear
          child's blood? O that God would pardon me in this thing, or take my
          life in the place of my son's!" Thus, I say, Abraham might have
          argued, and that too seemingly with great reason, against complying
          with the divine command. But as before by faith he considered not the
          deadness of Sarah's womb, when she was past age, but believed on him,
          who said, "Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed;" so now, being
          convinced that the same God spoke to and commanded him to offer up
          that son, and knowing that God was able to raise him from the dead,
          without delay he obeys the heavenly call.<br />
          <br />
          O that unbelievers would learn of faithful Abraham, and believe
          whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it!
          Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his son, and therefore
          believed, notwithstanding carnal reasoning might suggest may
          objections. We have sufficient testimony, that God has spoken to us by
          his son; why should we not also believe, though many things in the New
          Testament are above our reason? For, where reason ends, faith begins.
          And, however infidels may stile themselves reasoners, of all men they
          are the most unreasonable: For, is it not contrary to all reason, to
          measure an infinite by a finite understanding, or think to find out
          the mysteries of godliness to perfection?<br />
          <br />
          But to return to the patriarch Abraham: We observed before what
          plausible objections he might have made; but he answered not a single
          word: no, without replying against his Maker, we are told, verse 3,
          that "Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
          took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
          wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went unto the place of
          which God had told him."<br />
          <br />
          From this verse we may gather, that God spoke to Abraham in a dream,
          or vision of the night: For it is said, he rose up early. Perhaps it
          was near the fourth watch of the night, just before break of day, when
          God said, Take now thy son; and Abraham rises up early to do so; as I
          doubt not but he used to ruse early to offer up his morning-sacrifice
          of praise and thanksgiving. It is often remarked of people in the Old
          Testament, that they rose early in the morning; and particularly of
          our Lord in the New, that he rose a great while before day to pray.
          The morning befriends devotion; and, if people cannot use so much
          self-denial as to rise early to pray, I know not how they will be able
          to die at a stake (if called to it) for Jesus Christ.<br />
          <br />
          The humility as well as the piety of the patriarch is observable: he
          saddled his own ass (great men should be humble) and to show the
          sincerity, though he took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his
          son, yet he keeps his design as a secret from them all: nay, he does
          not so much as tell Sarah his wife; for he knew not but she might be a
          snare unto him in this affair; and, as Rebekah afterwards, on another
          occasion, advised Jacob to flee, so Sarah also might persuade Isaac to
          hide himself; or the young men, had they known of it, might have
          forced him away, as in after-ages the soldiers rescued Jonathan out of
          the hands of Saul. But Abraham fought no such evasion, and therefore,
          like an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile, he himself
          resolutely "clave the wood for the burnt-offering, rose up and went
          unto the place of which God had told him." In the second verse God
          commanded him to offer up his son upon one of the mountains which he
          would tell him of. He commanded him to offer his son up, but would not
          then directly tell him the place where: this was to keep him dependent
          and watching unto prayer: for there is nothing like being kept waiting
          upon God; and, if we do, assuredly God will reveal himself unto us yet
          further in his own time. Let us practice what we know, follow
          providence so far as we can see already; and what we know not, what we
          see not as yet, let us only be found in the way of duty, and the Lord
          will reveal even that unto us. Abraham knew not directly where he was
          to offer up his son; but he rises up and sets forward, and behold now
          God shows him: "And he went to the place of which God had told him."
          Let us go and do likewise.<br />
          <br />
          Verse 4. "Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw
          the place afar off."<br />
          <br />
          So that the place, of which God had told him, was no less than three
          days journey distant from the place where God first appeared to him,
          and commanded him to take his son. Was not this to try his faith, and
          to let him see that what he did, was not merely from a sudden pang of
          devotion, but a matter of choice of deliberation? But who can tell
          what the aged patriarch felt during these three days? Strong as he was
          in faith, I am persuaded his bowels often yearned over his dear son
          Isaac. Methinks I see the good old man walking with his dear child in
          his hand, and now and then looking upon him, loving him, and then
          turning aside to weep. And perhaps, sometimes he stays a little behind
          to pour out his heart before God, for he had no mortal to tell his
          case to. Then, methinks, I see him join his son and servants again,
          and talking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, as
          they walked by the way. At length, "on the third day, he lifts up his
          eyes, and saw the place afar off." And, to show that he was yet
          sincerely resolved to do whatsoever the Lord requested of him, he even
          how will not discover his design to his servants, but "said, verse 5.
          To his young men," (as we should say to our worldly thoughts, when
          about to tread the courts of the Lord's house) "Abide you here with
          the ass; and I and the lad will go up yonder and worship, and come
          again to you." This was a sufficient reason for their staying behind;
          and, it being their master's custom to go frequently to worship, they
          could have no suspicion of what he was going about. And by Abraham's
          saying, that he and the lad would come again, I am apt to think he
          believed God would raise him from the dead, if so be he permitted him
          to offer his child up for a burnt-offering. However that be, he is yet
          resolved to obey God to the uttermost; and therefore,<br />
          <br />
          Verse 6. "Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it
          upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and
          they went both of them together." Little did Isaac think that he was
          to be offered on that very wood which he was carrying upon his
          shoulders; and therefore Isaac innocently, and with a holy freedom
          (for good men should not keep their children at too great a distance)
          "spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father; and he (with
          equal affection and holy condescension) said, Here am I, my son." And
          to show how careful Abraham had been (as all Christian parents ought
          to do) to instruct his Isaac how to sacrifice to God, like a youth
          trained up in the way wherein he should go; Isaac said, "Behold the
          fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" How
          beautiful is early piety! How amiable, to hear young people ask
          questions about sacrificing to God in an acceptable way! Isaac knew
          very well that a lamb was wanting, and that a lamb was necessary for a
          proper sacrifice: "Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb
          for a burnt-offering?" Young men and maidens, learn of him.<br />
          <br />
          Hitherto, it is plain, Isaac knew nothing of his father's design: but
          I believe, by what his father said in answer to his question, that now
          was the time Abraham revealed it unto him.<br />
          <br />
          Verse 8. "And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a Lamb
          for a burnt-offering." Some think, that Abraham by faith saw the Lord
          Jesus afar off, and here spoke prophetically of that Lamb of God
          already slain in decree, and hereafter to be actually offered up for
          sinners. This was a lamb of God's providing indeed (we dared not have
          thought of it) to satisfy his own justice, and to render him just in
          justifying the ungodly. What is all our fire and wood, the best
          preparations and performances we can make or present, unless God had
          provided himself this Lamb for a burnt-offering? He could not away
          with them. The words will well hear this interpretation. But, whatever
          Abraham might intend, I cannot but think he here made an application,
          and acquainted his son, of God's dealing with his soul; and at length,
          with tears in his eyes, and the utmost affection in his heart, cried
          out, "Thou art to be the lamb, my Son;" God has commanded me to
          provide thee for a burnt-offering, and to offer thee upon the mountain
          which we are now ascending. And, as it appears from a subsequent
          verse, Isaac, convinced that it was the divine will, made no
          resistance at all; For it is said, "They went both of them together;"
          and again, when we are told, that Abraham bound Isaac, we do not hear
          of his complaining, or endeavoring to escape, which he might have
          done, being (as some think) near thirty years of age, and, it is
          plain, capable of carrying wood enough for a burnt-offering. But he
          was partaker of the like precious faith with his aged father, and
          therefore is as willing to be offered, as Abraham is to offer him: And
          "so they went both of them together."<br />
          <br />
          Ver. 9 At length "they came to the place of which God had told
          Abraham. He built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
          bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."<br />
          <br />
          And here let us pause a while, and by faith take a view of the place
          where the father has laid him. I doubt not but that blessed angels
          hovered round the altar, and sang. "Glory be to God in the highest,"
          for giving such faith to man. Come, all ye tender hearted parents, who
          know what it is to look over a dying child: fancy that you saw the
          altar erected before you, and the wood laid in order, and the beloved
          Isaac bound upon it: fancy that you saw the aged parent standing by
          weeping. (For, why may we not suppose that Abraham wept, since Jesus
          himself wept at the grave of Lazarus?) O what pious, endearing
          expressions passed now alternately between the father and the son!
          Joseph records a pathetic speech made by each, whether genuine I now
          not: but methinks I see the tears trickle down the Patriarch Abraham's
          cheeks; and out of the abundance of the heart, he cries, Adieu, adieu,
          my son; the Lord gave thee to me, and the Lord calls thee away;
          blessed be the name of the Lord: adieu, my Isaac, my only son, whom I
          love as my own soul; adieu, adieu. I see Isaac at the same time meekly
          resigning himself into his heavenly Father's hands, and praying to the
          most High to strengthen his earthly parent to strike the stroke. But
          why do I attempt to describe what either son or father felt? It is
          impossible: we may indeed form some faint idea of, but shall never
          full comprehend it, till we come and sit down with them in the kingdom
          of heaven, and hear them tell the pleasing story over again. Hasten, O
          Lord, that blessed time! O let thy kingdom come!<br />
          <br />
          And now, the fatal blow is going to be given. "And Abraham stretched
          forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son." But do you not
          think he intended to turn away his head, when he gave the blow? Nay,
          why may we not suppose he sometimes drew his hand in, after it was
          stretched out, willing to take another last farewell of his beloved
          Isaac, and desirous to defer it a little, though resolved at last to
          strike home? Be that is it will, his arm is now stretched out, the
          knife is in his hand, and he is about to put it to his dear son's
          throat.<br />
          <br />
          But sing, O heavens! and rejoice, O earth! Man's extremity is God's
          opportunity: for behold, just as the knife, in all probability, was
          near his throat, ver. 11, "the angel of the Lord, (or rather the Lord
          of angels, Jesus Christ, the angel of the everlasting covenant) called
          unto him, (probably in a very audible manner) from heaven, and said,
          Abraham, Abraham. (The word is doubled, to engage his attention; and
          perhaps the suddenness of the call made him draw back his hand, just
          as he was going to strike his son.) And Abraham said, Here am I."<br />
          <br />
          "And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any
          thing unto him: for now know I that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
          not withheld thy son, thine only son from me."<br />
          <br />
          Here then it was that Abraham received his son Isaac from the dead in
          a figure. He was in effect offered upon the altar, and God looked upon
          him as offered and given unto him. Now it was that Abraham's faith,
          being tried, was found more precious than gold purified seven times in
          the fire. Now as a reward of grace, though not of debt, for this
          signal act of obedience, by an oath, God gives and confirms the
          promise, "that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be
          blessed," ver. 17, 18. With what comfort may we suppose the good old
          man and his son went down from the mount, and returned unto the young
          men! With what joy may we imagine he went home, and related all that
          had passed to Sarah! And above all, with what triumph is he now
          exulting in the paradise of God, and adoring rich, free,
          distinguishing, electing, everlasting love, which alone made him to
          differ from the rest of mankind, and rendered him worthy of that title
          which he will have so long as the sun and the moon endure, "The Father
          of the faithful!"<br />
          <br />
          But let us now draw our eyes from the creature, and do what Abraham,
          if he was present, would direct to; I mean, fix them on the Creator,
          God blessed for evermore.<br />
          <br />
          I see your hearts affected, I see your eyes weep. (And indeed, who can
          refrain weeping at the relation of such a story?) But, behold, I show
          you a mystery, hid under the sacrifice of Abraham's only son, which,
          unless your hearts are hardened, must cause you to weep tears of love,
          and that plentifully too. I would willingly hope you even prevent me
          here, and are ready to say, "It is the love of God, in giving Jesus
          Christ to die for our sins." Yes; that is it. And yet perhaps you find
          your hearts, at the mentioning of this, not so much affected. Let this
          convince you, that we are all fallen creatures, and that we do not
          love God or Christ as we ought to do: for, if you admire Abraham
          offering up his Isaac, how much more ought you to extol, magnify and
          adore the love of God, who so loved the world, as to give his only
          begotten Son Christ Jesus our Lord, "that whosoever believeth on Him
          should not perish, but have everlasting life?" May we not well cry
          out, Now know we, O Lord, that thou hast loved us, since thou hast not
          withheld thy Son, thine only Son from us! Abraham was God's creature
          (and God was Abraham's friend) and therefore under the highest
          obligation to surrender up his Isaac. But O stupendous love! Whilst we
          were his enemies, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under
          the law, that he might become a curse for us. O the freeness, as well
          as the infinity, of the love of God our Father! It is unsearchable: I
          am lost in contemplating it; it is past finding out. Think, O
          believers, think of the love of God, in giving Jesus Christ to be a
          propitiation for our sins. And when you hear how Abraham built an
          altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid
          him on the altar upon the wood; think how your heavenly Father bound
          Jesus Christ his only Son, and offered him upon the altar of his
          justice, and laid upon him the iniquities of us all. When you read of
          Abraham's stretching forth his hand to slay his son, Think, O think,
          how God actually suffered his Son to be slain, that we might live for
          evermore. Do you read of Isaac carrying the wood upon his shoulders,
          upon which he was to be offered? Let this lead you to mount Calvary
          (this very mount of Moriah where Isaac was offered, as some think) and
          take a view of the antitype Jesus Christ, the Son of God, bearing and
          ready to sink under the weight of that cross, on which he was to hang
          for us. Do you admire Isaac so freely consenting to die, though a
          creature, and therefore obliged to go when God called? O do not forget
          to admire infinitely more the dear Lord Jesus, that promised seed, who
          willingly said, "Lo, I come," though under no obligation so to do, "to
          do thy will," to obey and die for men, "O God!" Did you weep just now,
          when I bid you fancy you saw the altar, and the wood laid in order,
          and Isaac laid bound on the altar? Look by faith, behold the blessed
          Jesus, our all-glorious Emmanuel, not bound, but nailed on a accursed
          tree: see how he hangs crowned with thorns, and had in derision of all
          that are round about him: see how the thorns pierce him, and how the
          blood in purple streams trickle down his sacred temples! Hark how the
          God of nature groans! See how he bows his head, and at length humanity
          gives up the ghost! Isaac is saved, but Jesus, the God of Isaac, dies;
          A ram is offered up in Isaac's room, but Jesus has no substitute;
          Jesus must bleed, Jesus must die; God the Father provided this Lamb
          for himself from all eternity. He must be offered in time, or man must
          be damned for evermore. And now, where are your tears? Shall I say,
          refrain your voice from weeping? No; rather let me exhort you to look
          to him whom you have pierced, and mourn, as a woman mourneth for her
          first-born: for we have been the betrayers, we have been the murderers
          of this Lord of glory; and shall we not bewail those sins, which
          brought the blessed Jesus to the accursed tree? Having so much done,
          so much suffered for us, so much forgiven, shall we not love much! O!
          let us love Him with all our hearts, and minds, and strength, and
          glorify him in our souls and bodies, for they are his. Which leads me
          to a second inference I shall draw from the foregoing discourse.<br />
          <br />
          From hence we may learn the nature of true, justifying faith. Whoever
          understands and preaches the truth, as it is in Jesus, must
          acknowledge, that salvation is God's free gift, and that we are saved,
          not by any or all the works of righteousness which we have done or can
          do: no; we can neither wholly nor in part justify ourselves in the
          light of God. The Lord Jesus Christ is our righteousness; and if we
          are accepted with God, it must be only in and through the personal
          righteousness, the active and passive obedience, of Jesus Christ his
          beloved Son. This righteousness must be imputed, or counted over to
          us, and applied by faith to our hearts, or else we can in no wise be
          justified in God's sight: and that very moment a sinner is enabled to
          lay hold on Christ's righteousness by faith, he is freely justified
          from all his sins, and shall never enter into condemnation,
          notwithstanding he was a fire-brand of hell before. Thus is was that
          Abraham was justified before he did any good work: he was enabled to
          believe on the Lord Christ; it was accounted to him for righteousness;
          that is, Christ's righteousness was made over to him, and so accounted
          his. This, this is the gospel; this is the only was of finding
          acceptance with God: good works have nothing to do with our
          justification in his sight. We are justified by faith alone, as saith
          the article of our church; agreeable to which the apostle Paul says,
          "By grace ye are saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it
          is the gift of God." Notwithstanding, good works have their proper
          place: they justify our faith, though not our persons; they follow it,
          and evidence our justification in the sight of men. Hence it is that
          the apostle James asks, was not Abraham justified by works? (alluding
          no doubt to the story on which we have been discoursing) that is, did
          he not prove he was in a justified state, because his faith was
          productive of good works? This declarative justification in the sight
          of men, is what is directly to be understood in the words of the text;
          "Now know I, says God, that thou fearest me, since thou hast not
          withheld thy son, thine only son from me." Not but that God knew it
          before; but this is spoken in condescension to our weak capacities,
          and plainly shows, that his offering up his son was accepted with God,
          as an evidence of the sincerity of his faith, and for this, was left
          on record to future ages. Hence then you may learn, whether you are
          blessed with, and are sons and daughters of, faithful Abraham. You say
          you believe; you talk of free grace and free justification: you do
          well; the devils also believe and tremble. But has the faith, which
          you pretend to, influenced your hearts, renewed your souls, and, like
          Abraham's, worked by love? Are you affections, like his, set on things
          above? Are you heavenly-minded, and like him, do you confess
          yourselves strangers and pilgrims on the earth? In short, has your
          faith enabled you to overcome the world, and strengthened you to give
          up your Isaacs, your laughter, your most beloved lusts, friends,
          pleasures, and profits for God? If so, take the comfort of it; for
          justly may you say, "We know assuredly, that we do fear and love God,
          or rather are loved of him." But if you are only talking believers,
          have only a faith of the head, and never felt the power of it in your
          hearts, however you may bolster yourselves up, and say, "We have
          Abraham for our father, or Christ is our Savior," unless you get a
          faith of the heart, a faith working by love, you shall never sit with
          Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, or Jesus Christ, in the kingdom of heaven.<br />
          <br />
          But I must draw one more inference, and with that I shall conclude.<br />
          <br />
          Learn, O saints! From what has been said, to sit loose to all your
          worldly comforts; and stand ready prepared to part with everything,
          when God shall require it at your hand. Some of you perhaps may have
          friends, who are to you as your own souls; and others may have
          children, in whose lives your own lives are bound up: all I believe
          have their Isaacs, their particular delights of some kind or other.
          Labor, for Christ's sake, labor, ye sons and daughters of Abraham, to
          resign them daily in affection to God, that, when he shall require you
          really to sacrifice them, you may not confer with flesh and blood, any
          more than the blessed patriarch now before us. And as for you that
          have been in any measure tried like unto him, let his example
          encourage and comfort you. Remember, Abraham your father was tried so
          before you: think, O think of the happiness he now enjoys, and how he
          is incessantly thanking God for tempting and trying him when here
          below. Look up often by the eye of faith, and see him sitting with his
          dearly beloved Issac in the world of spirits. Remember, it will be but
          a little while, and you shall sit with them also, and tell one another
          what God has done for your souls. There I hope to sit with you, and
          hear this story of his offering up his Son from his own mouth, and to
          praise the Lamb that sitteth upon the throne, for what he hath done
          for all or souls, for ever and ever.<br />
