          The persons to whom these words were written, were the members of the
          church of Corinth; who, as appears by the foregoing chapter, were not
          only divided into different sects, by one saying, "I am of Paul, and
          another, I am of Apollos;" but also had man amongst them, who were so
          full of the wisdom of this world, and so wise in their own eyes, that
          they set at nought the simplicity of the gospel, and accounted the
          Apostle's preaching foolishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never had the Apostle more need of the wisdom of the serpent, mingled
          with the innocency of the dove, than now. What is the sum of all his
          wisdom? He tells them, in the words of the text, "I determined not to
          know any thing amongst you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
        </p>
        <p>
          A resolution this, worthy of the great St. Paul; and no less worthy,
          no less necessary for every minister, and every disciple of Christ, to
          make always, even unto the 3end of the world.
        </p>
        <p>In the following discourse, I shall,</p>
        <p>
          First, Explain what is meant by "not knowing any thing, save Jesus
          Christ, and him crucified."
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Give some reasons why every Christian should determine not
          to know any thing else. And
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Conclude with a general exhortation to put this determination
          into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I am to explain what is meant by "not knowing any thing, save
          Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
        </p>
        <p>
          By Jesus Christ, we are to understand the eternal Son of God. He is
          called Jesus, a Savior, because he was to save us from the guilt and
          power of our sins; and, like Joshua, by whom he was remarkably
          typified, to lead God's spiritual Israel through the wilderness of
          this world, to the heavenly Canaan, the promised inheritance of the
          children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is called Christ, which signifies anointed, because he was anointed
          by the Holy Ghost at his baptism, to be a prophet to instruct, a
          priest to make an atonement for, and a king to govern and protect his
          church. And he was crucified, or hung (O stupendous love!) till he was
          dead upon the cross, that he might become a curse for us: for it is
          written, "Cursed is every man that hangeth upon a tree."
        </p>
        <p>
          The foundation or first cause of his suffering, was our fall in Adam;
          in whom, as the living oracles of God declare, "We all died;" his sin
          was imputed to us all. It pleased God, after he had spoken the world
          into being, to create man after his own divine image, to breathe into
          him the breath of life, and to place him as our representative in the
          garden of Eden.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he being left to his own free will, did eat of the forbidden
          fruit, notwithstanding God had told him, "The day in which he eat
          thereof, he should surely die;" and thereby he, with his whole
          posterity, in whose name he acted, became liable to the wrath of God,
          and sunk into a spiritual death.
        </p>
        <p>
          But behold the goodness, as well as the severity of God! For no sooner
          had man been convicted as a sinner, but lo! A Savior is revealed to
          him, under the character of the seed of the woman: the merits of whose
          sacrifice were then immediately to take place, and who should, in the
          fullness of time, by suffering death, satisfy for the guilt we had
          contracted; by obeying the whole moral law, work out for us an
          everlasting righteousness; and by becoming a principle of new life in
          us, destroy the power of the devil, and thereby restore us to a better
          state than that in which we were at first created.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the plain scriptural account of that mystery of godliness, God
          manifested in the flesh; and to this our own hearts, unless blinded by
          the god of this world, cannot but yield an immediate assent.
        </p>
        <p>
          For, let us but search our own hearts, and ask ourselves, if we could
          create our own children, whether or not we would not create them with
          a less mixture of good and evil, than we find in ourselves? Supposing
          God then only to have our goodness, he could not, at first, make us so
          sinful, so polluted as we are. But supposing him to be as he is,
          infinitely good, or goodness itself, then it is absolutely impossible
          that he should create any thing but what is like himself, perfect,
          entire, lacking nothing. Man then could not come out of the hands of
          his Maker, so miserably blind and naked, with such a mixture of the
          beast and devil, as he finds now in himself, but must have fallen from
          what he was; and as it does not suit with the goodness and justness of
          God, to punish the whole race of mankind with these disorders merely
          for nothing; and since men bring these disorders into the world with
          them; it follows, that as they could not sin themselves, being yet
          unborn, some other man's sin must have been imputed to them; from
          whence, as from a fountain, all these evils flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this doctrine of our original sin, or fall in Adam, is esteemed
          foolishness by the wise disputer of this world, who will reply, How
          does it suit the goodness of God, to impute one man's sin to an
          innocent posterity? But has it not been proved to a demonstration,
          that it is so? And therefore, supposing we cannot reconcile it to our
          shallow comprehensions, that is no argument at all: for if it appears
          that God has done a thing, we may be sure it is right, whether we can
          see the reasons for it or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is entirely cleared up by what was said before, that no
          sooner was the sin imputed, but a Christ was revealed; and this
          Christ, this God incarnate, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, that
          he might be freed from the guilt of our original sin; who was born of
          the Virgin Mary, that he might be the seed of the woman only; who
          suffered under Pontius Pilate, a Gentile governor, to fulfill these
          prophecies, which signified what death he should die: This same Jesus,
          who was crucified in weakness, but raised in power, is that divine
          person, that Emmanuel, that God with us, whom we preach, in whom ye
          believe, and whom alone the Apostle, in the text, was determined to
          know.
        </p>
        <p>
          By which word know, we are not to understand a bare historical
          knowledge; for to know that Christ was crucified by his enemies at
          Jerusalem, in this manner only, will do us no more service, than to
          know that Caesar was butchered by his friends at Rome; but the work
          know, means to know, so as to approve of him; as when Christ says,
          "Verily, I know you not;" I know you not, so as to approve of you. It
          signifies to know him, so as to embrace him in all his offices; to
          take him to be our prophet, priest, and king; so as to give up
          ourselves wholly to be instructed, saved, and governed by him. It
          implies an experimental knowledge of his crucifixion, so as to feel
          the power of it, and to be crucified unto the world, as the Apostle
          explains himself in the epistle to the Philippians, where he says, "I
          count all things but dung and dross, that I may know him, and the
          power of his resurrection."
        </p>
        <p>
          This knowledge the Apostle was so swallowed up in, that he was
          determined not to know any thing else; he was resolved to make that
          his only study, the governing principle of his life, the point and end
          in which all his thoughts, words, and actions, should center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I pass on to give some reasons why every Christian should,
          with the Apostle, determine "not to know any thing, save Jesus Christ,
          and him crucified."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Without this, our persons will not be accepted in the sight of
          God. "This (and consequently this only) is life eternal, to know thee,
          the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent." As also St.
          Peter says, "There is now no other name given under heaven, whereby we
          can be saved, but that of Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, indeed, ma please themselves in knowing the world, others boast
          themselves in the knowledge of a multitude of languages; but could we
          speak with the tongue of men and angels, or did we know the number of
          the stars, and could call them all by their names, yet, without this
          experimental knowledge of Jesus Christ, and him crucified, it would
          profit us nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The former, indeed, may procure us a little honor, which cometh of
          man; but the latter only can render us acceptable in the sight of God:
          for, if we are ignorant of Christ, God will be to us a consuming fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is the way, the truth, and the life; "No one cometh to the
          Father, but through him;" "He is the Lamb slain from the foundation of
          the world;" and none ever were, or ever will be received up into
          glory, but by an experimental application of his merits to their
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might as well think to rebuild the tower of Babel, or reach heaven
          with our hands, as to imagine we could enter therein by any other
          door, than that of the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Other knowledge may
          make you wise in your own eyes, and puff you up; but this alone
          edifieth, and maketh wise unto salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the meanest Christian, if he knows but this, though he know nothing
          else, will be accepted; so the greatest master in Israel, the most
          letter- learned teacher, without this, will be rejected. His
          philosophy is mere nonsense, his wisdom mere foolishness in the sight
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author of the word now before us, was a remarkable instance of
          this; never, perhaps, was a greater scholar, in all what the world
          calls fine learning, than he: for he was bred up at the feet of
          Gamaliel, and profited in the knowledge of books, as well as in the
          Jewish religion, above many of his equals, as appears by the language,
          rhetoric, and spirit of his writings; and yet, when he came to know
          what it was to be a Christian, "He accounted all things but loss, so
          he might win Christ." And, though he was now at Corinth, that seat of
          polite learning, yet he was absolutely determined not to know any
          thing, or to make nothing his study, but what taught him to know Jesus
          Christ, and him crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence then, appears the folly of those who spend their whole lives in
          heaping up other knowledge; and, instead of searching the scriptures,
          which testify of Jesus Christ, and are alone able to make them wise
          unto salvation, disquiet themselves in a pursuit after the knowledge
          of such things, as when known, concern them no more, than to know that
          a bird dropped a feather upon one of the Pyrenean mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it is, that so many, who profess themselves wise, because they
          can dispute of the causes and effects, the moral fitness and unfitness
          of things, appear mere fools in the things of God; so that when you
          come to converse with them about the great work of redemption wrought
          out for us by Jesus Christ, and of his being a propitiation for our
          sins, a fulfiller of the covenant of works, and a principle of new
          life to our souls, they are quite ignorant of the whole matter; and
          prove, to a demonstration, that, with all their learning, they know
          nothing yet, as they ought to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, alas! how must it surprise a man, when the Most High is about to
          take away his soul, to think that he has passed for a wise-man, and a
          learned disputer in this world, and yet is left destitute of that
          knowledge which alone can make him appear with boldness before the
          judgment-seat of Jesus Christ? How must it grieve him, in a future
          state, to see others, whom he despised as illiterate men, because they
          experimentally knew Christ, and him crucified, exalted to the
          right-hand of God; and himself, with all his fine accomplishments,
          because he knew every thing, perhaps, but Christ, thrust down into
          hell?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well might the Apostle, in a holy triumph, cry out, "Where is the
          wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?" For,
          God will then make foolish the wisdom of this world, and bring to
          nought the wisdom of those who were so knowing in their own eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made this digression from the main point before us, not to
          condemn or decry human literature, but to show, that it ought to be
          used only in subordination to divine; and that a Christian, if the
          Holy Spirit guided the pen of the Apostle, when he wrote this epistle,
          ought to study no books, but such as lead him to a farther knowledge
          of Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is the more reason for this, because of he great mischief
          the contrary practice has done to the church of God: for, what was it
          but this learning, or rather this ignorance, that kept so many of the
          Scribes and Pharisees from the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ? And
          what is it, but this human wisdom, this science, false so called, that
          blinds the understanding, and corrupts the hearts of so many modern
          unbelievers, and makes them unwilling to submit to the righteousness
          which is of God by faith in Christ Jesus? But,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Without this knowledge our performances, as well as persons
          will not be acceptable in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Through faith," says the Apostle, that is, through a lively faith in
          a Mediator to come, "Abel offered a more acceptable sacrifice than
          Cain." And it is through a like faith, or an experimental knowledge of
          the same divine Mediator, that our sacrifices of prayer, praise, and
          thanksgivings, come up as an incense before he throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two persons may go up to the temple to pray; but he only will return
          home justified, who, in the language of our collects, sincerely offers
          up his prayers through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          For it is this great atonement, this all-sufficient sacrifice, which
          alone can give us boldness to approach with our prayers o the Holy of
          Holies: and he that presumes to go without this, acts Korah's crime
          over again; offers unto God strange fire, and, consequently, will be
          rejected by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Farther, as our devotions to God will not, so neither, without this
          knowledge of Jesus Christ, will our acts of charity to men be accepted
          by him. For did we give all our goods to feed the poor, and yet were
          destitute of this knowledge, it would profit us nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This our blessed Lord himself intimates in the 25th of Matthew, where
          he tells those who had been rich in good works, "That inasmuch as they
          did it unto one of the least of his brethren, they did it unto him."
          From whence we may plainly infer, that it is seeing Christ in his
          members, and doing good to them out of an experimental knowledge of
          his love to us, that alone will render our alms-deeds rewardable at
          the last day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, As neither our acts of piety nor charity, so neither will our
          civil nor moral actions be acceptable to God, without this
          experimental knowledge of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our modern pretenders to reason, indeed, set up another principle to
          act from; they talk, I know not what, Of doing moral an civil duties
          of life, from the moral fitness and unfitness of things. But such men
          are blind, however they may pretend to see; and going thus about to
          establish their own righteousness, are utterly ignorant of the
          righteousness which is of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          For though we grant that morality is a substantial part of
          Christianity, and that Christ came not to destroy, or take off the
          moral law, as a rule of action, but to explain, and so fulfill it; yet
          we affirm, that our moral and civil actions are now no farther
          acceptable in the sight of God the Father, than as they proceed from
          the principle of a new nature, and as experimental knowledge of, or
          vital faith in his dear Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          The death of Jesus Christ has turned our whole lives into one
          continued sacrifice; and whether we eat or drink, whether we pray to
          God, or do any thing to man, it must all be done out of a love for,
          and knowledge of him who died and rose again, to render all, even our
          most ordinary deeds, acceptable in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we live by this principle, if Christ be the Alpha and Omega of all
          our actions, then our least are acceptable sacrifices; but if this
          principle be wanting, our most pompous services avail nothing: we are
          but spiritual idolater; we sacrifice to our own net; we make an idol
          of ourselves, by making ourselves, and not Christ, the end of our
          actions: and, therefore, such actions are so far from being accepted
          by God, that, according to the language of one of the Articles of our
          Church, "We doubt not but they have the nature of sin, because they
          spring not from an experimental faith in, and knowledge of Jesus
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Were we not fallen creatures, we might then act, perhaps, from other
          principles; but since we are fallen from God in Adam, and are restored
          again only by the obedience and death of Jesus Christ, the face of
          things I entirely changed, and all we think, speak, or do, is only
          accepted in and through him.
        </p>
        <p>Justly, therefore, may I, in the</p>
        <p>
          Third and Last places, Exhort you to put the Apostle's resolution in
          practice, and beseech you, with him to determine, Not to know any
          thing, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
        </p>
        <p>
          I say, determine; for unless you sit down first, and count the cost,
          and from a well-grounded conviction of the excellency of this ,above
          all other knowledge whatsoever, resolve to make this your chief study,
          your only end, your one thing needful, every frivolous temptation will
          draw you aside from the pursuit after it.

          Your friends and carnal acquaintance, and, above all, your grand
          adversary the devil, will be persuading you to determine not to know
          any thing, but how to lay up goods for many years, and to get a
          knowledge and taste of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world;
          but do you determine not to follow, or be led by them; and the more
          they persuade you to know other things, the more do you "determine not
          to know any thing, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." For, this
          knowledge never faileth; but whether they be riches, they shall fail;
          whether they be pomps, they shall cease; whether they be vanities,
          they shall fade away: but the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and him
          crucified, abideth for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever, therefore, you are ignorant of, be not ignorant of this. If
          you know Christ, and him crucified, you know enough to make you happy,
          supposing you know nothing else; and without this, all your other
          knowledge cannot keep you from being everlastingly miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Value not then, the contempt of friends, which you must necessarily
          meet with upon your open profession to act according to this
          determination. For your Master, whose you are, was despised before
          you; and all that will know nothing else but Jesus Christ, and him
          crucified, must, in some degree or other, suffer persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is necessary that offenses should come, to try what is in our
          hearts, and whether we will be faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ or
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dare ye then to confess our blessed Master before men, and to shine as
          lights in the world, amidst a crooked and perverse generation? Let us
          not be content with following him afar off; for then we shall, as
          Peter did, soon deny him; but let us be altogether Christians, and let
          our speech, and all our actions declare to the world whose disciples
          we are, and that we have indeed "determined not to know any thing,
          save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." Then, well will it be with us,
          and happy, unspeakably happy shall we be, even here; and what is
          infinitely better, when others that despised us, shall be calling for
          the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, we shall
          be exalted to sit down on the right-hand of God, and shine as the sun
          in the firmament, in the kingdom of our most adorable Redeemer, for
          ever and ever.
        </p>
