          Luke 14:22-24 -- "And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast
          commanded, and yet there is room. And the lord said unto the servant,
          Go out into the high-ways, and hedges, and compel them to come in,
          that my house may be filled. For I say unto you, that none of those
          men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper."
        </p>
        <p>
          Though here is a large and solemn assembly, yet I suppose you are all
          convinced, that you are not to live in this world always. May I not
          take it for granted, that even the most profane amongst you, do in
          your hearts believe, what the sacred oracles have most clearly
          revealed, "That as it is appointed for all men once to die, so after
          death comes the judgment?" Yes, I know you believe, that nothing is
          more certain, than that we are to "appear before the judgment-seat of
          Christ, to be rewarded according to the deeds done in the body,
          whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil." And,
          however hard the saying may seem to you at the first hearing, yet I
          cannot help informing you, that I am thoroughly persuaded, as many
          will be driven from that judgment-seat, with a "Depart ye cursed into
          everlasting fire," for pursuing things in themselves lawful, out of a
          wrong principle, and in too intense a degree; as for drunkenness,
          adultery, fornication, or any other gross enormity [atrocity, outrage,
          depravity] whatsoever. Bas as the world is, blessed be God, there are
          great numbers yet left amongst us, who either through the restraints
          of a religious education, or self-love, and outward reputation,
          abstain from gross sin themselves, and look with detestation and
          abhorrence upon others, who indulge themselves in it. But then,
          through an over-eager pursuit after the things of sense and time,
          their souls are insensibly lulled into a spiritual slumber, and by
          degrees become as dead to God, and as deaf to all the gracious
          invitations of the gospel, as the most abandoned prodigals. It is
          remarkable, therefore, that our Savior, knowing how desperately wicked
          and treacherous the heart of man was, in this, as well as other
          respects, after he had cautioned his disciples, and us in them, to
          "take heed that their hearts were not at any time overcharged with
          surfeiting and drunkenness," immediately adds, "and the cares (the
          immoderate anxious cares) of this life." For they are of a
          distracting, intoxicating nature, and soon overcharge and weigh down
          the hearts of the children of men. To prevent or remedy this evil, our
          Lord, during the time of his tabernacling here below, spake many
          parables, but not one more pertinent, not one, in which the freeness
          of the gospel-call, and the frivolous pretenses men frame to excuse
          themselves from embracing it, and the dreadful doom they incur by so
          doing, are more displayed, or set off in livelier colors, than that to
          which the words of the text refer. "And the lord said unto the
          servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come
          in, that my house may be filled: For I say unto you, that none of
          those that were bidden shall taste of my supper."
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to have a clear view of the occasion, scope, and contents of
          the parable, to which these words belong, it is necessary for us to
          look back to the very beginning of this chapter. "And it came to pass,
          as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread,
          on the Sabbath day, that they watched him." The person here spoken of,
          as going into this Pharisee's house, is our blessed Savior. For as he
          came eating and drinking, agreeable to his character, he was free,
          courteous and affable [friendly, good-natured] to all; and therefore
          though it was on a Sabbath-day, he accepted an invitation, and went
          into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread,
          notwithstanding he knew the Pharisees were his professed enemies, and
          that they watched him, hoping to find some occasion to upbraid him,
          either for his discourse or behavior. If the Pharisee into whose house
          our Lord went, was one of this stamp, his invitation bespeaks him to
          be a very ill man, and may serve to teach us, that much rancor and
          heart-enmity against Jesus Christ, may be concealed and cloaked under
          a great and blazing profession of religion. However, our Savior was
          more than a match for all his enemies, and by accepting this
          invitation, hath warranted his ministers and disciples, to comply with
          the like invitations, and converse freely about the things of God,
          though those who invite them, may not have real religion at heart. For
          how knowest thou, O man, but thou mayest drop something, that may
          benefit their souls, and make them religious indeed? And supposing
          they should watch thee, watch thou unto prayer, whilst thou art in
          their company, and that same Jesus, who went into this Pharisee's
          house, and was so faithful and edifying in his conversation when
          there, will enable thee to go and do likewise.
        </p>
        <p>
          That our Lord's conversation was not trifling, but such as tended to
          the use of edifying, and that he behaved among the guests as a
          faithful physician, rather than as a careless, indifferent companion,
          is evident from the 7th verse of this chapter, where we are told, that
          "he marked how they chose the chief rooms;" or, to speak in our common
          way, were desirous of sitting at the upper end of the table. And
          whether we think of it or not, the Lord Jesus takes notice of our
          behavior, even when we are going to sit down only at our common meals.
          Would to God, all that make a profession of real Christianity,
          considered this well! Religion then would not be so much confined to
          church, or meeting, but be brought home to our private houses, and
          many needless unchristian compliments be prevented. For (with grief I
          speak it) is it not too true, that abundance of professors love, and
          are too fond of the uppermost places in houses, as well as synagogues?
          This was what our Lord blamed in the guests where he now was. He
          marked, he took notice, he looked before he spake (as we should always
          do, if we would speak to the purpose) how they chose out the chief
          rooms. Therefore, though they were rich in this world's goods, and
          were none of his guests, yet unwilling to suffer the least sin upon
          them, or lost any opportunity of giving instruction, he gave them a
          lecture upon humility, saying unto them, or directing his discourse to
          all in general, though probably he spake to one in particular, who sat
          near him, and whom, it may be, he took notice of, as more than
          ordinarily solicitous in choosing a chief room, or couch, on which
          they lay at meals, after the custom of the Romans; "When thou art
          bidden of any man to a wedding (which seems to intimate that this was
          a wedding-feast) sit not down in the highest room, lest a more
          honorable man than thou be bidden of him; and he that bade thee and
          him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with
          shame to take the lowest room. But when thou are bidden, go and sit
          down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may
          say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship (or
          respect) in the presence of them who sit at meat with thee." O
          glorious example of faithfulness and love to souls! How ought
          ministers especially, to copy after their blessed Master, and, with
          simplicity an godly sincerity, mildly and opportunely rebuke the
          faults of the company they are in, though superior to them in outward
          circumstances? What rightly informed person, after reading this
          passage, can think they teach right and agreeable to the word of God
          in this respect, who say, we must not, at least need not, reprove
          natural men? Surely such doctrine cometh not from above! For are we
          not commanded, in any wise, to reprove our neighbor (whether he be a
          child of God or no) and not to suffer sin upon him? Is it not more
          than probable, that all these guests were natural men? And yet our
          Lord reproved them. Help us then, O Savior, in this and every other
          instance of thy moral conduct, to walk as thou hast set us an example!
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither did our Lord stop here; but observing that none but the rich,
          the mighty, and the noble, were called to the feast, he took occasion
          also from thence, to give even his host ( for the best return we make
          our friends for their kindness, is to be faithful to their souls) one
          of the chief Pharisees, a wholesome piece of advice. "Then said he
          also to him that bade him, when thou makest a dinner or a supper, call
          not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich
          neighbors, lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made
          thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
          lame, the blind, and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense
          thee. For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just!"
          Thus did our Lord entertain the company. Words spoken in such due
          season, how good are they! Would Christ's followers thus exert
          themselves, and, when in company, begin some useful discourse for
          their great master, they know not what good they might do, and how
          many might be influenced, by their good example, to second them in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          An instance of this we have in the 14th verse: "And when one of them
          that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him,
          Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God." Happy they
          who shall be recompensed at that resurrection of the just, which thou
          hast been speaking of. A very pertinent saying this! every way
          suitable to persons sitting down to eat bread on earth, which we
          should never do, without talking of, and longing for that time, when
          we shall sit down and eat bread in the kingdom of heaven. This opened
          to our Lord a fresh topic of conversation, and occasioned the parable,
          which is to be the more immediate subject of your present meditation.
          As though he had said to the person that spoke last, Thou sayest
          right: blessed are they indeed, who shall sit down to eat bread in the
          kingdom of God: But alas! most men, especially you Pharisees, act as
          if you did not believe this; and therefore he said unto him, "A
          certain man made a great supper, and bade many;" by the certain man
          making a great supper, we are to understand God the Father, who has
          made provision for perishing souls, by the obedience and death of his
          beloved Son Christ Jesus. This provision is here represented under the
          character of a supper, because the Caena or supper, among the
          ancients, was their grand meal: Men could never have made such
          provision for themselves, or angels for them. No, our salvation is all
          from God, from the beginning to the end. He made it, and not we
          ourselves; and it is wholly owing to the divine wisdom, and not our
          own, that we are become God's people, and the sheep of his pasture.
          This provision for perishing souls, may be justly called great,
          because there is rich and ample provision made in the gospel for a
          great many souls. For however Christ's flock may be but a little
          flock, when asunder, yet when they come all together, they will be a
          multitude which no man can number. And it is especially called great,
          because it was purchased at so great a price, the price of Christ's
          most precious blood. And therefore, when the apostle would exhort the
          Christians to glorify God in their souls and bodies, he makes use of
          this glorious motive, "That they were bought with a price." He does
          not say what price, but barely a price, emphatically so called; as
          though all the prices in the world were nothing (as indeed they are
          not) when compared to this price of Christ's most precious blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these reasons, Jesus said in the parable, "A certain man made a
          great supper, and bade many, and sent his servant at supper-time, to
          say to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready." He
          bade many; the eternal God took the Jews for his peculiar people,
          under the Mosaic dispensation; and by types, shadows, and prophesies
          of the Old Testament, invited them to partake of the glorious
          privileges of the gospel. "But at supper-time," in the fullness of
          time, which God the Father had decreed from eternity, in the evening
          of the world (for which reason the gospel times are called the last
          times) "he sent his servant," Christ his Son, here called his servant,
          because acting as Mediator he was inferior to the Father; therefore
          says the prophet Isaiah, "Behold my servant whom I have chosen:" "to
          say to them that were bidden," to the professing Jews, called by St.
          John, "his own," that is, his peculiar professing people -- with this
          message, "Come;" repent and believe the gospel. Nothing is required on
          man's part, but to come, or accept of the gospel offer. It is not
          according to the old covenant, "Do and live;" but only "come, believe,
          and thou shalt be saved." All things are ready. Nothing is wanting on
          God's part. "All things are now ready." There seems to be a particular
          emphasis to be put upon now, implying, this was an especial season of
          grace, and God was now exerting his last efforts, to save lost man.
          Well then, if the great God be at so great an expense, to make so
          great a supper, for perishing creatures, and sends so great a person
          as his own Son, in the form of a servant, to invite them to come to
          it; one would imagine, that all who heard these glad tidings, should
          readily say, Lord, lo we come. But instead of this, we are told, "They
          all, (the greatest part of the Jews) with one consent began to make
          excuse." Conscience told them they ought to come, and in all
          probability they had some faint desire to come; and they had nothing,
          as we hear of, to object either against the person who prepared the
          supper, or the person that invited them, or the entertainment itself;
          neither do we hear that they treated either with contempt, as is the
          custom of too many in the days wherein we live. In all probability,
          they acknowledged all was very good, and that it was kind in that
          certain man, to send them such an invitation. But being very busy, and
          as they thought very lawfully engaged, they begun to make excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the excuses they made, rendered their refusal inexcusable. "The
          first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs
          go and see it." Thou fool, buy a piece of ground, and then go see it!
          A prudent man would have gone and seen the ground first, and bought it
          afterwards. Why must he needs go? At least, why must he needs go now?
          The land was his own, could he not therefore have accepted the
          invitation today, and gone and seen his estate, or plantation, on the
          morrow? As he had bought it, he need not fear losing his bargain, by
          anothers buying it from him. But notwithstanding all this, there is a
          needs must for his going, and therefore says he, "I pray thee, have me
          excused," and improve thy interest with thy master in my behalf. This
          was a bad excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second was rather worse. For what says the evangelist, verse 19?
          "And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
          them:" One, it seems, had been buying an estate; another, cattle, to
          stock an estate already bought; and both equally foolish in making
          their bargains. For this second had bought five yoke of oxen, which
          must needs cost them a considerable sum, perhaps all he had in the
          world, and now he must go and prove them. A wise dealer would have
          proved the oxen first, and bought them afterwards: But our Savior
          speaks this, to show us, that we will trust one another, nay I may
          add, the devil himself, more than we will trust God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The excuse which the third makes, is worst of all. "I have married a
          wife, and therefore I cannot come." Had he said, I will not come, he
          had spoken the real sentiments of his heart: for it is not so much
          men's impotency , as their want of a will, and inclination, that keeps
          them from the gospel-feast. But why cannot he come? He has "married a
          wife." Has he so? Why then, by all means he should come. For the
          supper to which he was invited, as it should seem, was a
          wedding-supper, and would have saved him the trouble of a nuptial
          entertainment. It was a great supper, and consequently there was
          provision enough for him, and his bride too. And it was made by a
          great man, who sent out his servant to bid many, so that he need not
          have doubted of meeting with a hearty welcome, though he should bring
          his wife with him. Or supposing his wife was unwilling to come, yet as
          the husband is the head of the wife, he ought to have laid his
          commands on her, to accompany him. For we cannot do better for our
          yoke-fellows, than to bring them to the gospel-feast. Or, supposing
          after all, she would not be prevailed upon, he ought to have gone
          without her: for "those that have wives, must be as though they had
          none;" and we must not let carnal affection get such an ascendancy
          over us, as to be kept thereby from spiritual entertainments. Adam
          paid dear for hearkening to the voice of his wife: and sometimes,
          unless we forsake wives, as well as houses and lands, we cannot be the
          Lord's disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then was the reception the servant met with, and such were the
          excuses, and answers, that were sent back. And what was the
          consequence? "So that servant came (no doubt with a sorrowful heart)
          and showed his Lord these things." However little it be thought of,
          yet ministers must show the Lord, what success their ministry meets
          with. We must how it to our Lord here. We must spread the case before
          him in prayer. We must show it to our Lord hereafter, before the
          general assembly of the whole world. But how dreadful is it, when
          ministers are obliged to go upon their knees, crying, "O! my leanness,
          my leanness!" and Elias-like, to intercede as it were against those,
          to whom they would not only have imparted the gospel, but even their
          own lives. It is a heart-breaking consideration. But thus it must be;
          "The servant came and showed the Lord these things;" so must we. Well,
          and what says the Lord? We are told, verse 21st, that "the master of
          the house was angry?" Not with the servant: for though Israel be not
          gathered, yet shall Christ be glorious; and faithful ministers shall
          be rewarded, whether people obey the gospel or not. "We are a sweet
          savor unto God, whether the world be a savor of life unto life, or a
          savor of death unto death." The master of the house therefore was
          angry, not with the servant, but with these worldly-minded,
          pleasure-taking refusers of his gracious invitation; who, in all
          probability, went to see and stock their estates, and attend upon
          their brides, not doubting, but their excuses would be taken, because
          they were lawfully employed. And, indeed, in one sense, their excuses
          were accepted. For I do not hear that they were ever invited any more.
          God took them at their word, though they would not take him at his.
          They begged to be excused, and they were excused, as we shall see in
          the sequel of this parable. Let us not therefore harden our hearts, as
          in the day of provocation; "Now is the accepted time, now is the day
          of salvation." But must the feast want guests? No, if they cannot, or
          will not come, others shall, and will. The master of the house
          therefore being angry, sent the servant upon a second errand. "Go out
          quickly into the streets, and lanes of the city, and bring in hither
          the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind." Every word
          bespeaks a spirit of resentment and importunity. Go out quickly, make
          no delay, dread no attempt or danger, into the streets and lanes of
          the city, and bring in hither, not only call them, but bring them in
          (for the master here, to encourage the servant, assures him of
          success) the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. This
          was fulfilled, when Jesus Christ, after the gospel was rejected by the
          Jews, went and invited the Gentiles, and when the publicans and
          harlots took the kingdom of God by a holy violence, whilst the self-
          righteous scribes and Pharisees rejected the kingdom of God against
          themselves. This was also a home reproof of the rich Pharisee, at
          whose house the Lord Jesus was, as well as a cutting lesson to the
          other guests. For our Savior would hereby show them, that God took a
          quite different method from his host, and was not above receiving the
          poor, and halt, and blind, and maimed, to the gospel supper, though he
          had called none such to sit down at his table. Whether the guests
          resented it or not, we are not told. But if they were not quite blind,
          both host and guests might easily see that the parable was spoken
          against them. But to proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          The servant again returns, but with a more pleasing answer than
          before, "Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is
          room." The words bespeak the servant to be full of joy at the thoughts
          of the success he had met with. None can tell, but those who
          experience it, what comfort ministers have in seeing their labors
          blest. "Now I live, (says the apostle) if you stand fast in the Lord.
          Ye are our joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus."
          "Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded. The poor, and maimed, and
          halt, and blind, have been called, and have obeyed the summons, and I
          have brought them with me; yet, Lord, thy house, and thy supper is so
          great, there is room for more. Hereby he insinuated that he wanted to
          be employed again, in calling more souls; and the more we do, the more
          may we do for God: "To him that hath, shall be given;" and present
          success is a great encouragement to future diligence. Such hints are
          pleasing to our Savior. He delights to see his ministers ready for new
          work, and waiting for fresh orders. "The Lord, therefore, we are told,
          ver.23, said unto his servant, (the same servant,) Go out into the
          highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
          filled; 24. For I say unto you, that none of those who are bidden,
          shall taste of my supper." O cutting words to those that sat at meat,
          if they had hearts to make the application! But glad tidings of great
          joy to the publicans, harlots, and Gentiles, who were rejected by the
          proud Pharisees, as aliens to the commonwealth of Israel, and
          strangers to the covenant of promise! This was fulfilled, when our
          Lord sent the apostles, not only into the streets and lanes of the
          city, and places bordering upon Jerusalem and Judea; but when he gave
          them a commission to go out into all the world, and preach the gospel
          to every creature, Gentile as well a Jew; and not only gave them a
          command, but blessed their labors with such success, that three
          thousand were converted in one day. And I am not without hopes that it
          will be still further fulfilled, by the calling of some of you home
          this day. For however this parable was spoken originally to the Jews,
          and upon a particular occasion, as at a feast, yet it is applicable to
          us, and to our children, and to as many as are afar off; yea, to as
          many as the Lord our God shall call. It gives a sanction, methinks, to
          preaching in the fields, and other places besides the synagogues; and
          points our the reception the gospel meets with in these days, in such
          a lively manner, that one would think it had a particular reference to
          the perfect age. For is it not too, too plain, that the gospel-offers,
          and gospel-grace, have been slighted, and made light of, by many
          professors of this generation? We have been in the churches, telling
          them, again and again, that God has made a great supper (and has
          invited many, even them) and sent us by his providence and his spirit,
          "to say unto them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now
          ready. Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved." But the
          generality of the laity have made light of it, they have given us the
          hearing, but are too busy in their farms and their merchandises, their
          marrying and giving in marriage, to come and be blessed in the Lord of
          life. We have told them, again and again, that we do not want them to
          hide themselves from the world, but to teach them how they may live
          in, and yet not be of it. But all will not do. Many of the clergy also
          (like the letter-learned Scribes and Pharisees in our Savior's time)
          reject the kingdom of God against themselves, and deny us the use of
          the pulpits, for no other reason but because we preach the doctrine of
          justification in the sight of God by faith alone, and invite sinners
          to come and taste of the gospel feast freely, without money and
          without price.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever they may think, we are persuaded, the great master of the
          house is angry with them, for being angry with us without a cause. He
          therefore now, by his providence, bids us "Go out quickly into the
          streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, and the maimed,
          and the halt, and the blind," or call in the publicans and harlots,
          the common cursers and swearers, and Sabbath-breakers, and adulterers,
          who, perhaps, never entered a church door, or heard that Jesus Christ
          died for such sinners as they are. We, through grace, have obeyed the
          command, we have gone out, though exposed to such contempt for so
          doing, and, blessed be God, our labor has not been in vain in the
          Lord. For many have been made willing in the day of God's power; and,
          we would speak it with humility, we can go cheerfully to our Savior,
          and say, "It is done, Lord, as thou hast commanded, and yet there is
          room." He is therefore pleased, in spite of all opposition from men or
          devils, to continue, and renew, and enlarge our commission; he hath
          sent us literally into the highways and hedges; and, I trust, has
          given us a commission to compel sinners to come. For, could we speak
          with the tongues of men and angels, yet if the Lord did not attend the
          word with his power, and sweetly inclined men's wills to comply with
          the gospel-call, we should be as a sounding brass, or a tinkling
          cymbal. But this we believe our Savior will do, for his house must be
          filled: every soul for whom he has shed his blood, shall finally be
          saved, "and all that the Father hath given him, shall come unto him,
          and whosoever cometh unto him he will in no wise cast out." This
          comforted our Lord, when his gospel was rejected by the Jews. As
          though he had said, Well, tho' you despise the offers of my grace, yet
          I shall not shed my blood in vain; for all that the Father hath given
          me shall come unto me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supported by this consideration, I am not ashamed to come out this day
          into the highways and hedges, and to confess that my business is to
          call the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind,
          self-condemned, helpless sinners, to the marriage-feast of the supper
          of the Lamb. My cry is, Come, believe on the Lord Jesus; throw
          yourselves at the footstool of his mercy, and you shall be saved; for
          all things are now ready. God the Father is ready, God the Son is
          ready, God the Holy Ghost is ready; the blessed angels above are
          ready, and the blessed saints below are ready, to welcome you to the
          gospel-feast. A perfect and everlasting righteousness is now wrought
          out by Jesus Christ. God, now, upon honorable terms, can acquit the
          guilty. God can now be just, and yet justify the ungodly. "For he hath
          made Christ to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
          the righteousness of God in him." The fatted calf is now killed, and
          "Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us." Come, sinners, and feed
          upon him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving. For Jesus
          Christ's sake, do not with one consent begin to make excuse. Do not
          let a piece of ground, five yoke of oxen, or even a wife, keep you
          from this great supper. These you may enjoy, as the gifts of God, and
          make use of them for the Mediator's glory, and yet be present at the
          gospel feast. True and undefiled religion does not take away, but
          rather greatly enhances the comforts of life; and our Lord did not
          pray that we should be taken out of the world, but "that we should be
          delivered from the evil of it." O then that you would all, with one
          consent, say, Lo! we come. Assure yourselves here is provision enough.
          For it is a great supper. In our Father's house there is bread enough
          and to spare. And though a great God makes the supper, yet he is as
          good and condescending as he is great. Though he be the high and lofty
          one that inhabiteth eternity, yet he will dwell with the humble and
          contrite heart, even with the man that trembleth at his word. Neither
          can you complain for want of room; "for yet there is room. In our
          Father's house are many mansions." If it was not so, our Savior would
          have told us. The grace of Christ is as rich, as free, and as powerful
          as ever. He is "the same yesterday, today, and for ever." He is full
          of grace and truth, and out of his fullness, all that come to him may
          receive grace for grace. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not. He
          willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should believe
          and live. Come then, all ye halt, poor, maimed, and blind sinners;
          take comfort, the Lord Jesus has sent his servant to call you. It is
          now supper-time, and a day of uncommon grace. The day may be far
          spent. Haste, therefore, and away to the supper of the Lamb. If you do
          not come, I know the master will be angry. And who can stand before
          him when he is angry? "Harden not therefore your hearts, as in the day
          of provocation, as in the day of temptation in the wilderness." Do not
          provoke the Lord to say, "None of those that were bidden shall taste
          of my supper." O dreadful words! Much more is implied in them than is
          expressed. It is the same with that in the psalms, "I sware in my
          wrath, that they should not enter into my rest." And if you do not
          enter into God's rest, nor taste of Christ's supper, you must lift up
          your eyes in torments, where you will have no rest, and must sup with
          the damned devils for ever more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing therefore the terrors of the Lord, we persuade you to haste
          away, and make no more frivolous excuses. For there is no excuse
          against believing. Perhaps you say, You call to the halt, and maimed,
          and blind, and poor. But if we are halt, and maimed, how can we come?:
          if we are blind, how can we see our way? If we are poor, how can we
          expect admission to so great a table? Ah! Happy are ye, if you are
          sensible, that you are halt and maimed. For if you feel yourselves so,
          and are lamenting it, who knows but whilst I am speaking, God may send
          his Spirit with the word, and fetch you home? Though you are blind,
          Jesus has eye salve to anoint you. Though you are poor, yet you are
          welcome to this rich feast. It cost Jesus Christ a great price, but
          you shall have it gratis. For such as you was it designed: "Blessed
          are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Rich,
          self-righteous, self-sufficient sinners, I know, will scorn both the
          feast and its great provider. They have done so already, therefore the
          Lord ha sent us into the highways and hedges, to bring such poor souls
          as you are in. Venture then, my dear friends, and honor God, by taking
          him at his word. Come to the marriage-feast. Believe me, you will
          there partake of most delicious fare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tell me, ye that have been made to taste that the Lord is gracious,
          will you not recommend this feast to all? Are you not; whilst I am
          speaking, ready to cry out, Come all ye that are without, come ye,
          obey the call, for we have sat under the Redeemer's shadow with great
          delight, and his fruit has been pleasant to our taste. Whilst I am
          speaking, does not the fire kindle, do not your hearts burn with a
          desire that others may come and be blessed too? If you are Christians
          indeed, I know you will be thus minded, and the language of your
          hearts will be, Lord, whilst he is calling, let thy Spirit compel them
          to come in. O that the Lord may say, Amen! And why should we doubt?
          Surely our Savior will not let me complain this day that I have
          labored in vain, and spent my strength for nought. Methinks I see many
          desiring to come. O how shall I compel you to come forwards. I will
          not use fire or sword, as the Papists do, by terribly perverting this
          text of scripture. But I will tell you of the love of God, the love of
          God in Christ, and surely that must compel you, that must constrain
          you, whether you will or not. Sinners, my heart is enlarged towards
          you. I could fill my mouth with arguments. Consider the greatness of
          the God who makes the supper. Consider the greatness of the price,
          wherewith it was purchased. Consider the greatness of the provision
          made for you. What would you have more? Consider God's infinite
          condescension, in calling you now, when you might have been in hell,
          "where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." And that you
          might be without excuse, he has sent his servant into the highways and
          hedges to invite you there. O that you tasted what I do now! I am sure
          you would not want arguments to induce you to come in: No, you would
          fly to the gospel-feast, as doves to the windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, poor souls! many of you, perhaps, are not hungry. You do not feel
          yourselves halt, or maimed, or blind, and therefore you have no relish
          for this spiritual entertainment. Well, be not angry with me for
          calling you; be not offended if I weep over you, because you know not
          the day of your visitation. If I must appear in judgment as a swift
          witness against you, I must. But that thought chills my blood! I
          cannot bear it; I feel that I could lay down my life for you. But I am
          not willing to go without you. What say you, my dear friends? I would
          put the question to you once more, Will you taste of Christ's supper,
          or will you not? You shall all be welcome. There is milk at this feast
          for babes, as well as meat for strong men, and for persons of riper
          years. There is room and provision for high and low, rich and poor,
          one with another; and our Savior will thank you for coming. Amazing
          condescension! Astonishing love! The thought of it quite overcomes me.
          Help me, help me, O believers, to bless and praise him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And O! that this love may excite us to come afresh to him, as though
          we had never come before! For, though we have been often feasted, yet
          our souls will starve, unless we renew our acts of faith, and throw
          ourselves, as lost, undone sinners, continually at the feet of Christ.
          Feeding upon past experiences will not satisfy our souls, any more
          than what we did eat yesterday will sustain our bodies to day. No,
          believers must look for fresh influences of divine grace, and beg of
          the Lord to water them every moment. The parable therefore speaks to
          saints as well as sinners. Come ye to the marriage-feast; you are as
          welcome now as ever. And may God set your souls a longing for that
          time when we shall sit down and eat bread in the kingdom of heaven!
          There we shall have full draughts of divine love, and enjoy the
          glorious Emanuel for ever more. Even so, Lord Jesus, Amen.<br />
