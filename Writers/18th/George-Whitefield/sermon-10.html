          Ecclesiastes 7:16 -- "Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thyself
          over- wise: why shouldst thou destroy thyself?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is more frequent, than while people are living in a course of
          sin, and after the fashion and manner of the world, there is not
          notice taken of them; neither are their ways displeasing to their
          companions and carnal relations: but if they set their faces
          Zion-ward, and begin to feel the power of God on their hearts; they
          then are surrounded with temptations from their friends, who thus act
          the devil's part. The enemies, the greatest enemies a young convert
          meets with, my dear brethren, are those of his own house. They that
          will be godly, must suffer persecution; so it was in Christ'' time,
          and so it was in the Apostles time too; for our Lord came not to send
          peace, but a sword. Our relations would not have us sit in the
          scorner's chair; they would not have us be prodigals, consuming our
          substance upon harlots; neither would they have us rakes (a dissolute
          [loose in morals or conduct] person) or libertines, but they would
          have us be contented with an almost Christianity. To keep up our
          reputation by going to church, and adhering to the outward forms of
          religion, saying our prayers, reading the word of God, and taking the
          sacraments; this, they imagine, is all that is necessary for to be
          Christians indeed; and when we go one step farther than this, their
          mouths are open against us, as Peter's was to Christ: "Spare thyself,
          do thyself no harm."
        </p>
        <p>
          And of this nature are the words of the text. They are not the words
          of Solomon himself, but the words of an infidel speaking to him, whom
          he introduces in several parts of this book; for Solomon had been
          showing the misfortunes which attended the truly good, as in the verse
          before our text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this the infidel says, "Be not righteous over-much, neither be
          thou over-wise; why shouldst thou destroy thyself?" i.e. Why shouldst
          thou bring these misfortunes upon thyself, by being over strict? Be
          not righteous over-much; eat, drink, and be merry, live as the world
          lives, and then you will avoid those misfortunes which may attend you,
          by being righteous over-much.
        </p>
        <p>
          This text has another meaning; but take it which way you will, by
          brethren, it was spoken by an unbeliever; therefore it was no credit
          for the person who lately preached upon this text, to take it for
          granted, that these were the words of Solomon: the words of an infidel
          was not a proper text to a Christian congregation. But as David came
          out against Goliath, not armed as the champion was, with sword and
          spear, but with a sling and stone, and then cut off his head with his
          own sword; so I come out against these letter-learned men, in the
          strength of the Lord Jesus Christ; and, my dear brethren, I trust he
          will direct me to use my sling, so that our enemies may not gainsay
          us; and by the sword of God's word, cut off the heads of our
          Redeemer's enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          But though they are not the words of Solomon, yet we will take them in
          the same manner the late writer did; and, from the words, shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Show you what it is, not to be righteous over-much, that we may
          not destroy ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I shall let you see what it is to be righteous over-much.
          And then,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Conclude with an exhortation to all of you, high and low,
          rich and poor, one with another, to come to the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, The first thing proposed, is to show you what it is not to be
          righteous over-much. And here,
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by no means to be righteous over-much, to affirm we must have
          the same Spirit of God as the first Apostles had, and must feel that
          Spirit upon our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          By receiving the Spirit of God, is not to be understood, that we are
          to be inspired to show outward signs and wonders, to raise dead
          bodies, to cure leprous persons, or to give sight to the blind: these
          miracles were only of use in the first ages of the church; and
          therefore Christians (nominal Christians, for we have little else but
          the name) may have all the gifts of the Spirit, and yet none of the
          graces of it. Thou, O man, mayest be enabled by faith to remove
          mountains; thou, by the power of God, mayest cast out devils; thou, by
          that power, mayest speak with the tongues of men and angels; yes, thou
          mayest, by that power, hold up thy finger and stop the sun in the
          firmament; and if all these are unsanctified by the Spirit of God,
          they would be of no service to thee, but would hurry thee to hell with
          the greater solemnity. Saul received the spirit of prophesying, and
          had another heart, yet Saul was probably a cast-away. We must receive
          the Spirit of God in its sanctifying graces upon our souls; for Christ
          says, "Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
          We are all by nature born in sin, and at as great a distance from God,
          as the devils themselves. I have told you often, and now tell you
          again, that you are by nature a motley mixture of the beast and devil,
          and we cannot recover ourselves from the state wherein we have fallen,
          therefore must be renewed by the Holy Ghost. By the Holy Ghost, I
          mean, the third Person of the ever blessed Trinity, co-equal,
          co-essential, co-eternal, and consubstantial with the Father and the
          Son; and therefore, when we are baptized, it is into the nature of the
          Father, into the nature of the Son, and into the nature of the Holy
          Ghost: and we are not true Christians, till we are sanctified by the
          Spirit of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though our modern preachers do not actually deny the Spirit of God,
          yet they say, "Christians must not feel him;" which is in effect to
          deny him. When Nicodemus came to Christ, and the Lord Jesus was
          instructing him, concerning the new birth, says he to our Lord, "How
          can these things be?" Nicodemus, though a master of Israel, acts just
          as our learned Rabbi's do now. The answer that Christ gave him should
          stop the mouths of our letter- learned Pharisees: "The wind bloweth
          where it listeth, and we hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell
          whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth." Now till the Spirit of God is
          felt on our souls as the wind on our bodies, indeed, my dear brethren,
          you have no interest in him: religion consists not in external
          performance, it must be in the heart, or else it is only a name, which
          cannot profit us, a name to live whilst we are dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A late preacher upon this text, seems to laugh at us, for talking of
          the Spirit in a sensible manner, and talks to us as the Jews did to
          Christ: They said, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" So he
          asks, "What sign or proof do we give of it?" We do not imagine, that
          God must appear to us, and give it us: no; but there may be, and is, a
          frequent receiving, when no seeing of it; and it is as plainly felt in
          the soul, as any impression is, or can be, upon the body. To what a
          damnable condition should we bring poor sinners, if they could not be
          sensible of the Spirit of God; namely, a reprobate mind and past
          feeling?
        </p>
        <p>
          "What proof do they give?" says the writer. What sign would they have?
          Do they expect us to raise the dead, to give sight to the blind, to
          cure lepers, to make the lame to walk, and the deaf to hear? If these
          are what they expect, I speak with humility, God, by us, hath done
          greater things than these: many, who were dead in sin, are raised to
          scripture-life: those, who were leprous by nature, are cleansed by the
          Spirit of God; those, who were lame in duty, not run in God's
          commands; those, who were deaf, their ears are unstopped to hear his
          discipline, and hearken to his advice; and the poor have the gospel
          preached to them. No wonder people talk at this rate, when they can
          tell us, "That the Spirit of God, is a good conscience, consequent
          thereupon." My dear brethren, Seneca, Cicera, Plato, or any of the
          heathen philosophers, would have given as good a definition as this.
          It means no more, than reflecting that we have done well. This, this
          is only Deism refined: Deists laugh at us, when we pretend to be
          against notions, and yet these men use no other reason for our
          differing from them, than what is agreeable to Deists principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This writer tell us, "It is against common-sense to talk of the
          feeling of the Spirit of God." Common-sense, my brethren, was never
          allowed to be a judge; yea, it is above its comprehension, neither
          are, nor can the ways of God be known by common-sense. We should never
          have known the things of God at all by our common sense: no; it is the
          revelation of God which is to be our judge; it is that we appeal to,
          and not to our weak and shallow conceptions of things. Thus we may
          see, it is by no means to be righteous over-much, to affirm we must
          have the Spirit of God as the Apostles had. Nor,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Is it to be righteous over-much to frequent religious
          assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The preacher, upon this text, aims at putting aside all the religious
          societies that are in the kingdom: Indeed, he says, "You may go to
          church as often as opportunity serves, and on Sundays; say your
          prayers, read the word of God; and, in his opinion, every thing else
          had better be let alone: and as for the Spirit of God upon your souls,
          you are to look upon it as useless and unnecessary." If this, my
          brethren, is the doctrine we have now preached, Christianity is at a
          low ebb indeed; but God forbid you should thus learn Jesus Christ. Do
          you not forbear the frequenting of religious assemblies; for as
          nothing helps to build up the devil's kingdom more than the societies
          of wicked men, nothing would be more for pulling of it down, than the
          people of God meeting to strengthen each others hands; and as the
          devil has so many friends, will none of you be friends to the blessed
          Jesus? Yes, I hope many of you will be of the Lord's side, and build
          each other up in Christian love and fellowship. This is what the
          primitive Christians delighted in; and shall not we follow so
          excellent an example? My brethren, till Christian conversation is more
          agreeable to us, we cannot expect to see the gospel of Christ run and
          be glorified. Thus it is by no means to be righteous over-much, to
          frequent religious assemblies. Nor,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, Is it to be righteous over-much, to abstain from the
          diversions and entertainments of the age.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are commanded to "abstain from the appearance of evil," and that
          "whatsoever we do, whether we eat or drink, we shall do all to the
          glory of God." The writer upon this text tells us, "That it will be
          accounted unlawful to smell to a rose:" no, my dear brethren, you man
          smell to a pink and rose too if you please, but take care to avoid the
          appearance of sin. They talk of innocent diversions and recreations;
          for my part, I know of no diversion, but that of doing good: if you
          can find any diversion which is not contrary to your baptismal vow, of
          renouncing the pomps and vanities of this wicked world; if you can
          find any diversion which tends to the glory of God; if you can find
          any diversion, which you would be willing to be found at by the Lord
          Jesus Christ, I give you free license to go to them and welcome; but
          if, on the contrary, they are found to keep sinners from coming to the
          Lord Jesus Christ; if they are a means to harden the heart, and such
          as you would not willingly be found in when you come to die, then, my
          dear brethren, keep from them: for, indeed, the diversions of this age
          are contrary to Christianity. Many of you may think I have gone too
          far, but I shall go a great deal farther yet: I will attack the devil
          in his strongest holds, and bear my testimony against our fashionable
          and polite entertainments. What satisfaction can it be, what pleasure
          is there in spending several hours at cards? Strange! That even people
          who are grown old, can spend whole nights in this diversion: perhaps
          many of you will cry out, "What harm is there in it?" My dear
          brethren, whatsoever is not of faith, or for the glory of God, is a
          sin. Now does cards tend to promote this? Is it not mispending your
          precious time, which should be employed in working out your salvation
          with fear and trembling? Do play-houses, horse- racing, balls and
          assemblies, tend to promote the glory of God? Would you be willing to
          have your soul demanded of you, while you are at one of those places?
          Many of these are, (I must speak, I cannot forbear to speak against
          these entertainments; come what will, I will declare against them)
          many, I say, of these are kept up by public authority; the play-houses
          are supported by a public fund, and our newspapers are full of
          horse-races all through the kingdom: these things are sinful; indeed
          they are exceeding sinful. What good can come from a horse-race; from
          abusing God Almighty's creatures, and putting them to that use he
          never designed for them: the play-houses, are they not nurseries of
          debauchery in the age? And the supporters and patrons of them, are
          encouragers and promoters of all the evil that is done by them; they
          are the bane of the age, and will be the destruction of those who
          frequent them. Is it not high time for the true ministers of Jesus
          Christ, who have been partakers of the heavenly gift, to lift up their
          voices as a trumpet, and cry aloud against these diversions of the
          age? Are they not earthly, sensual, devilish? If you have tasted of
          the love of God, and have felt his power upon your souls, you would no
          more go to a play, than you would run your head into a furnace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what occasions these place to be so much frequented, is the
          clergy's making no scruple to be at these polite places: they frequent
          play-houses, they go to horse-races, they go to balls and assemblies,
          they frequent taverns, and follow all the entertainments that the age
          affords; and yet these are the persons who should advise their hearers
          to refrain from them; but instead thereof, they encourage them by
          their example. Persons are too apt to rely upon, and believe their
          pastors, rather than the scriptures; they think that there is no crime
          in going to plays or horse-races, to balls and assemblies; for if
          there were, they think those persons, who are their ministers, would
          not frequent them: but, my dear brethren, observe they always go
          disguised, the ministers are afraid of being seen in their gowns and
          cassocks; the reason thereof is plain, their consciences inform them,
          that it is not an example fit for the ministers of the gospel to set;
          thus, they are the means of giving that offense to the people of God,
          which I would not for ten thousand worlds: they lay a stumbling-block
          in the way of their weak brethren, which they will not remove, though
          it is a stumbling-block of offense. "Woe unto the world because of
          offenses, but woe unto that man by whom the offense cometh." The
          polite gentlemen of the age, spend their time in following those
          diversions, because the love of God is not in their hearts; they are
          void of Christ, and destitute of the Spirit of God; and not being
          acquainted with the delight there is in God and his ways, being
          strangers to these things, they run to the devil for diversions, and
          are pleased and delighted with the silly ones he shows them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear brethren, I speak of these things, these innocent diversions,
          as the polite part of the world calls them, by experience; perhaps
          none, for my age, hath read or seen more plays than I have: I took
          delight in, and was pleased with them. It is true, I went to church
          frequently, received the sacrament, and was diligent in the use of the
          forms of religion, but I was all this while ignorant of the power of
          God on my heart, and unacquainted with the work of grace; but when God
          was pleased to shine with power upon my soul, I could no longer be
          contented to feed on husks, or what the swine die eat; the Bible then
          was my food; there, and there only I took delight: and till you feel
          this same power, you will not abstain from the earthly delights of
          this age, you will take no comfort in God's ways, nor receive any
          comfort from him; for you are void of the love of God, having only the
          form of godliness, while you are denying the power of it; you are
          nominal Christians, when you have not the power of Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The polite gentlemen say, "Are we to be always upon our knees? Would
          you have us be always at prayer, and reading or hearing the word of
          God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear brethren, the fashionable ones, who take delight in hunting,
          are not tired of being continually on horseback after their hounds;
          and when once you are renewed by the Spirit of God, it will be a
          continua pleasure to be walking with, and talking of God, and telling
          what great things Jesus Christ hath done for your souls; and till you
          can find as much pleasure in conversing with God, as these men do of
          their hounds, you have no share in him; but when you have tasted how
          good the Lord is, you will show forth his praise; out of the abundance
          of your heart your mouth will speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings me to the second thing proposed, which is an extreme that
          very seldom happens:
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, To show what it is to be righteous over-much, And here,</p>
        <p>
          First, When we confine the Spirit of God to this or that particular
          church; and are not willing to converse with any but those of the same
          communion; this is to be righteous over-much with a witness: and so it
          is, to confine our communion within church-walls, and to think that
          Jesus could not preach in a field as well as on consecrated ground;
          this is judaism, this is bigotry: this is like Peter, who would not go
          to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, till he had a vision from God:
          and when his conduct was blamed by the disciples, he could not satisfy
          them till he had acquainted them with the vision he had seen. And,
          therefore, we may justly infer, the Spirit of God is the center of
          unity; and wherever I see the image of my Master, I never inquire of
          them their opinions; I ask them not what they are, so they love Jesus
          Christ in sincerity and truth, but embrace them as my brother, my
          sister, and my spouse: and this is the spirit of Christianity. Many
          persons, who are bigots to this or that opinion, when one of a
          different way of thinking hath come where they were, have left the
          room or place on the account: this is the spirit of the devil; and if
          it was possible that these persons could be admitted into heaven with
          such tempers, that very place would be hell to them. Christianity will
          never flourish, till we are all of one heart and of one mind; and this
          would be the only means of seeing the gospel of Jesus to flourish,
          more than ever it will by persecuting those who differ from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may be esteemed as enthusiasm and madness, and as a design to
          undermine the established church: No; God is my judge, I should
          rejoice to see all the world adhere to her articles; I should rejoice
          to see the ministers of the Church of England, preach up those very
          articles they have subscribed to; but those ministers who do preach up
          the articles, are esteemed as madmen, enthusiasts, schismatics, and
          underminers of the established church: and though they say these
          things of me, blessed be God, they are without foundation. My dear
          brethren, I am a friend to her articles, I am a friend to her
          homilies, I am a friend to her liturgy; and, if they did not thrust me
          out of their churches, I would read them every day; but I do not
          confine the Spirit of God there; for I say it again, I love all that
          love the Lord Jesus Christ, and esteem him my brother, my friend, my
          spouse; aye, my very soul is knit to that person. The spirit of
          persecution will never, indeed it will never make any to love Jesus
          Christ. The Pharisees make this to be madness, so much as to mention
          persecution in a Christian country; but there is as much of the spirit
          of persecution now in the world, as ever there was; their will is as
          great, but blessed be God, they want the power; otherwise, how soon
          would the send me to prison, make my feet fast in the stocks, yea,
          would think they did God service in killing me, and would rejoice to
          take away my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the Spirit of Christ, my dear brethren; I had not come to
          have thus preached; I had not come into the highways and hedges; I had
          not exposed myself to the ill treatment of these letter-learned men,
          but for the sake of your souls: indeed, I had no other reason, but
          your salvation; and for that (I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not)
          I would be content to go to prison; yea, I would rejoice to die for
          you, so I could but be a means to bring some of you to Jesus: I could
          not bear to see so many in the highway to destruction, and not show
          them their danger: I could not bear, my brethren, to see you more
          willing to learn, than the teachers are to instruct you: and if any of
          them were to come and preach to you, I should not envy them, I should
          not call them enthusiasts or madmen; I should rejoice to hear they had
          ten thousand times more success than I have met with; I would give
          them the right hand of fellowship; I would advise them to go on; I
          would wish them good luck in the name of the Lord, and say as Christ
          did, when the disciples informed him of some casting out devils in his
          name, and were for rebuking of them, "Forbid them not, for they that
          are not against us are for us;" or as St. Paul says, "Some preach
          Christ of envy, and some of good-will; notwithstanding, so Christ is
          but preached, I rejoice; yea, and will rejoice." The gospel of Jesus,
          is the gospel of peace. Thus you may see, that to be righteous
          over-much, is to be uncharitable, censorious, and to persecute persons
          for differing from us in religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Persons are righteous over-much, when they spend so much
          time in religious assemblies, as to neglect their families. There is
          no license given by the blessed Jesus, for idleness; for in the very
          infancy of the world, idleness was not allowed of. In paradise, Adam
          and Eve dressed the garden, Cain was a tiller of the ground, and Abel
          was a keeper of sheep; and there is a proverb amongst the Jews, "That
          he who brings his son up without a business, brings him up to be a
          thief:" and therefore our Savior was a carpenter; "Is not this the
          carpenter's son," said the Jews: and St. Paul, though brought up at
          the feet of Gamaliel, was a tent-maker. Labor, my brethren, is imposed
          on all mankind as part of the divine curse; and you are called to be
          useful in the society to which you belong: take care first for the
          kingdom of God, and all things necessary shall be added. To labor for
          the meat that perisheth, is your duty; only take care, that you do not
          neglect getting the meat for the soul: that is the greatest
          consequence, for this plain reason, the things of this life are
          temporal, but those of the next are eternal. I would have rich men to
          work as well as poor; it is owing to their idleness, that the devil
          hurries them to his diversions; they can be in their beds all the
          morning, and spend the afternoon and evening in dressing, visiting,
          and at balls, plays, or assemblies, when they should be working out
          their salvation with fear and trembling. Such a life as this,
          occasions a spiritual numbness in the soul; and if Jesus Christ was
          not to stop those who thus spend their time, they would be hurried
          into eternity, without once thinking of their immortal souls. But
          Jesus Christ has compassion upon many of them, and while they are in
          their blood, he bids them "live." And though I preach this doctrine to
          you, yet I do not bid you be idle; no, they that do not work should
          not eat. You have two callings, a general one, and a special one: as
          we are to regard the one in respect of our bodies, so we are to regard
          the other on account of our souls. Take heed, my brethren, I beseech
          you, take heed, lest you labor so for the meat that perisheth, as to
          forget that meat which endureth for ever. Seek the things of God
          first; look well to obtain oil in your lamps, grace in your hearts. I
          am not persuading you to take no care about the things of the world,
          but only not to be encumbered with them, so as to neglect your duty
          towards God, and a proper concern for your souls. It is meet, it is
          right, it is your bounden duty, to mind the calling wherein God hath
          placed you; and you may be said to be righteous over-much not to
          regard them. This brings me,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, To give you another sign of being righteous over-much; and
          that is, when we fast and use corporal authorities, so as to unfit us
          for the service of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, my brethren, you may think there is no occasion at all to
          caution you against, and indeed there is not a great necessity for it;
          however, many persons, upon their first being awakened to a sense of
          their sin, are tempted to use authorities to that excess which is
          sinful. It is our duty to fast, it is our duty to fast often, and it
          is what we are directed to by Jesus Christ himself; but then we are to
          take care to do it in a proper manner: to bring our bodies under for
          the service of God, is that which we are commanded by our Lord Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The late preacher upon this text, runs into great extremes, and
          charges us with saying and acting things of which we never thought;
          but I do not regard what he said of me: I do not mind his bitter
          invectives against my ministry; I do not mind his despising my youth,
          and calling me novice and enthusiast; I forgive him from my very
          heart: but when he reflects on my Master; when he speaks against my
          Redeemer; when Jesus Christ is spoken against, I must speak, (I must
          speak indeed, or I should burst:) when he gives liberty to persons to
          take a cheerful glass, and alledges Christ for an example, as in the
          marriage-feast, saying, "Christ turned water into wine, when it is
          plain there had been more drank than was necessary before;" what is
          this, but to charge Christ with encouraging drunkenness? It is true,
          the Governor says, "Every man in the beginning sets forth good wine,
          and when men have well drank, that which is worse; but thou hast kept
          the good wine until now:" but it does not at all follow, that it was
          not necessary, or that there had been a sufficient quantity before: I
          would not speak thus slightingly of one of my Master's miracles, for
          the whole world. And we may observe, that as Christ chiefly visited
          poor people, they might not have wherewithal to buy a sufficient
          quantity of wine; for having more guests than were expected, the wine
          was expended sooner than they thought; then the Mother of Jesus tells
          him, "They have no wine;" he answers, "Woman, what have I to do with
          thee? My hour is not yet come." After this he commanded them to fill
          the water-pots with water, and they filled them to the brim, and this
          water he turned into wine: now it does not follow, that there was more
          drank than was necessary; neither would the Lord Jesus Christ have
          continued in the house if there had. But we have an excellent lesson
          to learn from this miracle: by the water-pots being empty, we may
          understand, the heart of man being by nature destitute of his grace,
          his speaking and commanding to fill them, shows, that when Christ
          speaks, the heart that was empty of grace before, shall be filled; and
          the water pots being filled to the brim, shows, that Christ will fill
          believers hearts brim full of the Holy Ghost: and from the Governor's
          observing, that the last wine was the best, learn, that a believer's
          best comforts, shall be the last and greatest, for they shall come
          with the greatest power upon the soul, and continue longest there:
          this, this my dear brethren, is the lesson we may learn from this
          miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one great inconsistency I cannot avoid taking notice of in this
          late learned preacher. In the beginning of his sermon, he charges us
          with "laying heavy burdens upon people, which they are not able to
          bear;" in the latter part he charges us with being Antinomians, whose
          tenets are, "So you say you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you may
          live the life of devils." Now, he charges us with being too strict,
          and by and by with being too loose. Which side, my brethren, will you
          take? Thus you see, when persons forsake Christ, they make strange
          mistakes; for here can be no greater opposition of sentiments than
          this letter-learned writer has made: as opposite as light and
          darkness, good and evil, sweet and bitter. And, on this account, to
          find out these lettered-learned gentlemens notions of the new-birth, I
          put a paragraph in my Journal; and, blessed be God, I have obtained my
          desires, and have plainly perceived, that the persons who have lately
          written concerning the new-birth, know no more of it than a blind man
          does of colors, nor can they have any more notion of it, (by all their
          learning, falsely so called) than the blind man, who was to give an
          account what the sun was, and, after a considerable time allowed for
          study, he said, "It was like the sound of a trumpet." And till they
          are taught of God, they will be unacquainted with the new-birth;
          therefore, if you have a mind to know what the devil has to say
          against us, read Dr. Trapp's sermons.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is with grief I speak these things, and were not the welfare of
          your souls, and my Redeemer's honor at stake, I would not now open my
          mouth, yes I would willingly die (God is my judge) for the person who
          wrote such bitter things against me, so it would be a means of saving
          his soul. If he had only spoken against me, I would not have answered
          him; but, on his making my Redeemer a pattern of vice, if I was not to
          speak, the very stones would cry out; therefore, the honor of my
          Redeemer, and love to you, constrains me to speak. It is of necessity
          that I speak, when the divinity of Jesus Christ is spoken against, it
          is the duty of ministers to cry aloud, and spare not. I cannot
          forbear, come what will; for I know not what kind of divinity we have
          not among us: we must have a righteousness of our own, and do our best
          endeavors, and then Christ will make up the deficiency; that is, you
          must be your own Savior, in part. This is not the doctrine of the
          gospel; this not the doctrine of Jesus: no; Christ is all in all;
          Jesus Christ must be your whole wisdom; Jesus Christ must be your
          whole righteousness. Jesus Christ must be your whole sanctification;
          or Jesus Christ will never be your eternal redemption and
          sanctification. Inward holiness is looked on, by some, as the effect
          of enthusiasm and madness; and preachers of the necessity of the
          new-birth, are esteemed as persons fit for Bedlam. Our polite and
          fashionable doctrine, is, "That there is a fitness in man, and that
          God, seeing you a good creature, bestows upon you his grace." God
          forbid, my dear brethren, you should thus learn Jesus Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the doctrine I preach to you: I say, salvation is the free
          gift of God. It is God' free grace, I preach unto you, not of works,
          lest any one should boast. Jesus Christ justifies the ungodly; Jesus
          Christ passed by, and saw you polluted with your blood, and bid you
          live. It is not of works, it is of faith: we are not justified for our
          faith, for faith is the instrument, but by your faith, the active as
          well as the passive obedience of Christ, must be applied to you. Jesus
          Christ hath fulfilled the law, he hath made it honorable; Jesus Christ
          hath made satisfaction to his Father's justice, full satisfaction; and
          it is as complete as it is full, and God will not demand it again.
          Jesus Christ is the way; Jesus Christ is the truth; and Jesus Christ
          is the life. The righteousness of Jesus Christ, my brethren, must be
          imputed to you, or you can never have any interest in the blood of
          Jesus; your own works are but as filthy rags, for you are justified
          before God, without any respect to your works past, present, or to
          come. This doctrine is denied by the learned rabbi's; but if they deny
          these truths of the gospel, they must not offended, though a child
          dare speak to a doctor; and, in vindication of the cause of Jesus
          Christ, a child, a boy, by the Spirit of God, can speak to the learned
          clergy of this age.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had a voice so great, and could speak so loud, as that the whole
          world could hear me, I would cry, "Be not righteous over-much," by
          bringing your righteousness to Christ, and by being righteous in your
          own eyes. Man must be abased, that God may be exalted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ is a comfortable doctrine to
          all real Christians; and you sinners, who ask what you must do to be
          saved? How uncomfortable would it be, to tell you by good works, when,
          perhaps, you have never done one good work in all your life: this
          would be driving you to despair, indeed: no; "Believe in the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved:" therefore none of you need go
          away despairing. Come to the Lord Jesus by faith, and he shall receive
          you. You have no righteousness of your own to depend on. If you are
          saved, it is by the righteousness of Christ, through his atonement,
          his making a sacrifice for sin: his righteousness must be imputed to
          you, otherwise you cannot be saved. There is no difference between
          you, by nature, and the greatest malefactor that ever was executed at
          Tyburn: the difference made, is all owing to the free, the rich, the
          undeserved grace of God; this has made the difference. It is true,
          talking at this rate, will offend the Pharisees, who do not like this
          leveling doctrine, (as they call it); but if ever you are brought to
          Jesus Christ by faith, you will experience the truth of it. Come by
          faith to Jesus Christ; do not come, Pharisee-like, telling God what
          you have done, how often you have gone to church, how often you have
          received the sacrament, fasted, prayed, or the like: no; come to
          Christ as poor, lost, undone, damned sinners; come to him in this
          manner, and he will accept of you: do not be rich in spirit, proud and
          exalted, for there is no blessing attends such; but be ye poor in
          spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God; they shall be made members
          of his mystical body here, and shall be so of the church triumphant
          hereafter. Acknowledge yourselves as nothing at all, and when you have
          done all, say, "You are unprofitable servants." There is no salvation
          but by Jesus Christ; there is no other name given under heaven amongst
          men, whereby we may be saved, but that of the Lord Jesus. God, out of
          Christ, is a consuming fire; therefore strive for an interest in his
          Son the Lord Jesus Christ; take him on the terms offered to you in the
          gospel; accept of him in God's own way, lay hold on him by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not think you are Christians; do not flatter yourselves with being
          righteous enough, and good enough, because you lead moral decent
          lives, do no one any harm, go to church, and attend upon the outward
          means of grace; no, my brethren, you may do this, and a great deal
          more, and yet be very far from having a saving, experimental knowledge
          of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beg of Christ to strike home upon your hearts, that you may feel the
          power of religion. Indeed, you must feel the power of God here, or the
          wrath of God hereafter. These are truths of the utmost consequence;
          therefore, do not go contradicting, do not go blaspheming away.
          Blessed be God, you are not such cowards to run away for a little
          rain. I hope good things of you; I hope you have felt the power of
          God; and if God should bring any of you to himself through this
          foolishness of preaching, you will have no reason to complain it was
          done by a youth, by a child; no; if I could be made an instrument to
          bring you to God, they may call me novice, enthusiast, or what they
          please, I should rejoice; yea, and I would rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          O that some sinner might be brought to Jesus Christ! Do not say I
          preach despair; I despair of no one, when I consider God had mercy on
          such a wretch as I, who was running in a full career to hell: I was
          hastening thither, but Jesus Christ passed by and stopped me; Jesus
          Christ passed by me while I was in my blood, when I was polluted with
          filth; he passed by me, and bid me live. Thus I am a monument of God's
          free grace; and therefore, my brethren, I despair of none of you, when
          I consider, I say, what a wretch I was. I am not speaking now out of a
          false humility, a pretended sanctity, as the Pharisees call it: no,
          the truth in Christ I speak, and therefore, men and devils do your
          worst; I have a gracious Master will protect me; it is his work I am
          engaged in, and Jesus Christ will carry me above their rage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who are come here this night out of curiosity to hear what the
          babbler says; those who come to spend an idle hour to find something
          for an evening-conversation at a coffee-house; or you who have stopped
          in your coaches as you passed by, remember that you have had Jesus
          Christ offered to you; I offer Jesus Christ to every one of you:
          perhaps you may not regard it because it is in a field. But Jesus
          Christ is wherever his people meet in sincerity and truth to worship
          him: he is not confined to church walls: he has met us here; many,
          very many of you know he has; and therefore you may believe on him
          with greater confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you bear to think of a bleeding, panting, dying Jesus, offering
          himself up for sinners, and you will not accept of him? Do not say,
          you are poor, and therefore are ashamed to go to church, for God has
          sent the gospel out unto you. Do not harden your hearts: oppose not
          the will of Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          O that I could speak to your hearts, that my words would center there.
          My heart is full of love to you. I would speak, till I could speak no
          more, so I could but bring you to Christ. I may never meet you all,
          perhaps, any more. The cloud of God's providence seems to be moving.
          God calls me by his providence away from you, for a while. God knows
          whether we shall ever see each other in the flesh. At the day of
          judgment we shall all meet again. I earnestly desire your prayers.
          Pray that I may not only begin, John-like, I the spirit, but that I
          may continue in it. Pray that I may not fall away, that I may not
          decline suffering for you, if I should be called to it. Be earnest, O
          be earnest with God in my behalf, that while I am preaching to others,
          I may not be a cast-away. Put up your prayers for me, I beseech you.
          Go not to the throne of grace, without carrying me upon your heart;
          for you know not what influence your prayers may have. As for you, my
          dear brethren, God knows my heart. I continually bear you on my mind,
          when I go in and out before the Lord; and it is my earnest desire, you
          may not perish for lack of knowledge, but that he would send out more
          ministers to water what his own right-hand hath planted. May the
          Ancient of Days come forth upon his white horse, and may all
          opposition fall to the ground. As we have begun to bruise the
          serpent's head, we must expect he will bruise our heel. The devil will
          not let his kingdom fall without raging horribly. He will not suffer
          the ministers of Christ to go on, without bringing his power to stop
          them. But fear not, my dear brethren, David, though a stripling,
          encountered the great Goliath; and if we pray, God will give us
          strength against all our spiritual enemies. Show your faith by your
          works. Give the world the lye. Press forward. Do not stop, do not
          linger in your journey, but strive for the mark set before you. Fight
          the good fight of faith, and God will give you spiritual mercies. I
          hope we shall all meet at the right- hand of God. Strive, strive to
          enter in at the strait gate, that we may be born to Abraham's bosom,
          where sin and sorrow shall cease. No scoffer will be there, but we
          shall see Jesus, who died for us; and not only see him, but live with
          him forever.
