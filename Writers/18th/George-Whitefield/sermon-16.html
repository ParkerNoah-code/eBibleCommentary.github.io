        <p>Daniel 9:24 -- "And to bring everlasting Righteousness."</p>
        <p>
          On reading these words, I cannot help addressing you in the language
          of the angels to the poor shepherds, who kept watch over their flocks
          by night, "Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy," such
          tidings, that if we have ears to hear, if we have eyes to see, and if
          our hearts have indeed experienced the grace of God, must cause us to
          cry out with the Virgin Mary, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my
          spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior." The words which I have read to
          you, are part of one of the most explicit revelations that was given
          of Jesus Christ, before he made his public entrance into this our
          world. It has been observed by some, and very properly too, that it is
          one mark of the divine goodness to his creatures, that he is pleased
          to let light come in gradually upon the natural world. If the sun from
          midnight darkness, was immediately to shine forth in his full meridian
          blaze, his great splendor would be apt to dazzle our eyes, and strike
          us blind again: but God is pleased to make light come gradually in,
          and by that means we are prepared to receive it. And as God is pleased
          to deal with the natural, so he has dealt with the moral, with the
          spiritual world. The Lord Jesus Christ did not appear in his full
          glory all at once, but as the sun rises gradually, so did the Lord
          Jesus, the Sun of righteousness, rise gradually upon men, with healing
          under his wings. Hence it was, that our first parents had nothing to
          fix their faith upon, but that first promise, "The seed of the woman
          shall bruise the serpent's head." And in future ages, at sundry times,
          and after divers manners, God was pleased to speak to our fathers by
          the prophets, before he spake to us in these last days by his Son; and
          the prophets that were more peculiarly dear to God, it should seem had
          more peculiar and extraordinary revelations vouchsafed to them,
          concerning Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is plain from the accounts we have in Scripture, that the Prophet
          Daniel was one of these; he is stiled by the angel, not only a "man
          that was beloved," but a "man that was greatly beloved," or as it is
          in the margin of your bibles, "he was a man of desires," of large and
          extensive desires to promote the glory of God; he was a desirable man,
          a man that did much good in his generation, and therefore his life was
          much to be desired by those who loved God. The words which I have
          chosen for the subject of our present meditation, contain part of a
          revelation made to this man. If you look back to the beginning of this
          chapter, you will find how the good man was employed, when God was
          pleased to give him this revelation; verse 2, "In the first year of
          Darius's reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years,
          whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he
          would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem."
          Daniel was a great man, and withal a good man; great as he was, it
          seems he was not above reading his Bible; he made the Bible his
          constant study; for it is the Bible we are to understand by what is
          here termed books, and elsewhere, the scriptures of truth. He found,
          that the time for God's people being delivered from the captivity, was
          now at hand. Well, one would have thought, that therefore Daniel
          needed not to pray; but this, instead of retarding, quickened him in
          his prayers: and therefore we are told in the third verse, "I set my
          face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with
          fasting and sackcloth, and ashes." It is beautifully expressed: "he
          set his face," as though he was resolved never to let his eye go off
          God, till God was pleased to give him an answer; he was resolved,
          Jacob-like, to wrestle with the Lord God, until God should be pleased
          to give him the desired blessing. We are told in the fourth verse,
          that "he prayed unto the Lord, and made confession," not only of his
          own sins, but the sins of his people. And when ye retire hence to your
          houses, before ye go to bed, I would recommend to you the reading of
          this prayer; every word of it bespeaks his exceeding concern for the
          public good. It would take me up too much time, was I to make such
          observations as indeed the prayer deserved; to bring you sooner to the
          words of the text, let us go forward to the twentieth verse, and there
          you will find the success that Daniel met with, when praying. Says he,
          "And whiles I [was] speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and
          the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the
          Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; Yea, whiles I [was]
          speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
          vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about
          the time of the evening oblation. The manner in which Daniel expressed
          himself, is very emphatical: "While I was speaking in prayer;"
          implying, that God suffers us, when we draw near to him by faith in
          prayer, to lay all our complaints before him; he suffers us to speak
          unto, and talk with him, as a man talketh with his friend. Daniel at
          this time too was making confession one part of his prayer; for we are
          never, never in a better frame to receive answers from above, than
          when we are humbling ourselves before the Lord. He was not only
          confessing his own sins, but he was confessing the sins of his people;
          he was praying for those, who perhaps seldom prayed for themselves;
          "while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel:" which word, by
          interpretation, signifies the strength of God; a very proper name,
          says Bishop Hall, for that angel who was to come and bring the news to
          the world, of the God of strength, the Lord Jesus Christ. This angel
          is here represented as flying, and as flying swiftly; to show us how
          willing, how unspeakably willing those blessed spirits are, to bring
          good news to men. And it is upon this account, I suppose, that we are
          taught by our Lord to pray, "that God's will may be done by us on
          earth, as it is done in heaven," that we may imitate a little of that
          alacrity and vigor, which angels employ, when they are sent on errands
          for God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, here is not only mention made of the angel's flying swiftly, but
          there is mention made of the time that he came; "He came and touched
          me, about the time of the evening oblations," that is, about three
          o'clock in the afternoon; at this time there was a sacrifice made to
          God, and this sacrifice was in a peculiar manner a type of the Lord
          Jesus, who in the evening of the world was to become a sacrifice for
          sinners. We are told in the 22nd verse, what message this angel
          delivered, "He informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I
          am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding; at the
          beginning of thy supplication, the commandment came forth, and I am
          come to show thee, for thou art greatly beloved, therefore understand
          the matter, and consider the vision." This passage, with such like
          passages of scripture, hath often comforted my soul, and may comfort
          the hearts of all God's people. There are a great many of you,
          perhaps, have prayed, and prayed again to God, and probably you do not
          find any answer given you: you pray for an enlarged heart, you pray
          for comfort, you pray for deliverance; God is pleased to withhold it
          for a while; then the devil strikes in, and says, God has shut out
          your prayers, God will never hear, God will never regard you,
          therefore pray no more. But, my dear friends, this is a mistake; a
          thousand years are with God as one day; and the Lord Jesus had bid us,
          "to pray always, and not faint." You may have had your prayers heard,
          the very moment they went out of your lips, though it may not please
          your God, (and it may not be proper for you) to let you know that they
          are heard. "At the beginning of thy supplication, the commandment went
          forth;" and this very angel some hundred years after, told Zecharias,
          that his prayer was heard;" a prayer for what? A prayer for a child:
          it could not be supposed that at the very time Zecharias was praying
          for a child; but his prayer he had put up forty years before, God was
          pleased to answer so long afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to proceed with Gabriel's declaration, ver.24, Seventy years are
          determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish
          transgression, to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for
          iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness." I do not intend
          to trouble you about the critical exposition of these seventy weeks;
          commentators are divided exceedingly upon this subject; some of them
          explain them one way, and some another, and perhaps we shall never
          know till the day of judgment, till the glorious day spoken of in the
          New Testament, which are right. My intention is to dwell upon this
          particular part of the angel's message, that some one person was to do
          something unspeakable for God's people, even "to bring in an
          everlasting righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to know who was the person that was to do this, look to
          the 26th verse, and you will find the person mentioned, the Lord Jesus
          Christ: "after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off,
          but not for himself:" he is the person spoken of, he was "to put an
          end to sin, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
          everlasting righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>From these important words, I shall endeavor,</p>
        <p>
          First, To show you what we are to understand by the word,
          "Righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I shall endeavor to show you, upon what account it lay that
          the righteousness mentioned in the text, is called an "everlasting
          righteousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I shall show, what we are to understand by "bringing it in."
          And,
        </p>
        <p>
          Then speak a word to saints and sinners. And while I am speaking to
          your ears, may God, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, speak to your
          hearts!
        </p>
        <p>
          First, To explain what we are to understand by the word,
          "righteousness." If I was to ask some people what we are to understand
          by the word, righteousness; if the person was an Arminian, or an enemy
          to the doctrine of free grace, he would answer me, it signifies what
          we commonly call moral honesty, or doing justice between man and man.
          And, indeed, in various passages of scripture, the word righteousness
          has no other meaning, at least, it bears that meaning. I suppose, we
          are to understand it in this sense, when we are told, that Paul,
          preaching before Felix, "reasoned of temperance, of righteousness, and
          of a judgment to come." Felix had been a very unrighteous and unjust
          man, and therefore, to convince him of his wickedness, to alarm his
          conscience, to put him upon seeking help in the Lord Jesus, Paul
          preached not only of temperance, (for Felix had been a very
          intemperate man) but he preached to him of righteousness, of the
          necessity of doing justice because he had been an unjust man; and he
          puts before him the judgment to come, in order to make him fly to
          Jesus Christ for deliverance from the bad consequences of that
          judgment; and there are other places of scripture, where the word
          righteousness may be understood in this sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          It likewise signifies inward holiness, wrought in us by the blessed
          Spirit of God. But, I believe, the word righteousness in my text
          signifies, what, I trust most, I should be glad if I could say, all
          who attend this night, will be glad to hear of: What is that? It is
          what all reformed divines, that have clear heads and clean hearts,
          call an imputed righteousness, or the righteousness of the Lord Jesus
          Christ to be imputed to poor sinners upon their believing: and, if you
          ask me, what I mean by an imputed righteousness, not to shoot over you
          heads, but rather, if God shall be pleased to make me, to reach your
          hearts, I will tell you by the word "righteousness," I understand all
          that Christ hat done, and all that Christ hath suffered: or, to make
          use of the term generally made use of by sound divines, "Christ's
          active, and Christ's passive obedience;" put those two together, and
          they make up the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ. My dear
          friends, thus stood the case between God and man: at first God made
          man upright. Moses gives us a short, but never was so full a
          description of the origin and nature of man given by any other but
          himself. "In the image of God made he man, says the sacred historian,
          being inspired by the Spirit of God. God said, and it was done; God
          commanded, and the world arose before him; "Let there be light," and
          instantaneously behold light appeared: but when that lovely, that
          divine, that blessed creature Man, the Lord of the creation, God's
          vicegerent was to be made; God calls a council, and says, "Let us make
          man after our own image." Now, this image is to be understood, no
          doubt, in respect of man's soul; for God being no corporeal substance,
          man could not be made after his image that way. Well, in this
          condition God made man. Adam stood as our representative. Adam and Eve
          had but one name originally, "God made man, and called their name
          Adam. God left Adam to his own free will; he was pleased to enter into
          a covenant with him, which, indeed, is an amazing instance of God's
          condescension. God might have ordered man to do so and so, and not
          made him any promise of a reward: but the great Creator was pleased to
          promise him, that if he performed an unsinning obedience, if he
          abstained from eating a particular tree, that he and his posterity
          should live forever; but if he broke that command, in the day that he
          ate thereof, he and all his prosperity were to die. Now, I verily
          believe, had you and I been there present, however some people may
          object against God's severity, in imputing Adam's sin to us; yet I
          believe, if you and I, and all the world had been present, we should
          have heartily come into this agreement. Supposing God had called the
          whole creation together, and had said, "Ye, my creatures, I have made
          here a man after my own image, I have breathed into him the breath of
          life, I have caused him to become a living soul, I have filled him
          with righteousness and true holiness; he has not the least propensity
          to sin, only he is a fallible and mutable creature; all that I desire
          of this man is, that he abstain from yonder tree; I have given to him
          all the trees of the garden, I have made him, and planted for him a
          garden with mine own right hand, I desire he may abstain from plucking
          yonder fruit! Will ye stand or fall by this m an, will ye let him be
          your representative, will ye be content that his obedience or
          disobedience be imputed to you?" If we had been all there, every one
          of us would have said, "Lord God, we will let him be our
          representative;" the terms were so easy, the improbability of his
          falling was so exceeding great; that I believe every one of us should
          have all put our hand to the covenant. And supposing us alive, and
          that we had agreed to that covenant, who is that man or woman that
          could find fault with God's imputing Adam's sin to us. Well, my
          friends, God made man in this condition; the devil envied his
          happiness; it is supposed by some, that man was made to supply the
          places of the fallen angels. But the devil envied man, and had leave
          to tempt him; Eve soon reached out her hand and plucked of the
          forbidden fruit, and afterwards Adam transgressed also; and from that
          very moment, to make use of Mr. Beston's words, "Man's name was
          Ichabod," the glory of the Lord departed from him. Adam and Eve then
          fell; you, and I, and all their posterity (whom they represented) fell
          in them. Mankind had but one neck; and God might have served mankind,
          as Caligula would have served Rome, according to his own words, "I
          wish it had but one neck, and I would cut it off with one blow." God,
          if he pleased, might have sent us all to hell. Here Calvin represents
          God's attributes as struggling one with another; Justice saying to
          God, seeing Justice had framed the sanction, "Is the law broken, damn
          the offender, and send him to hell." The mercy of God, his darling
          attribute, cries out, "Spare him, spare him." The wisdom of God
          contrives a way, that justice might be satisfied, and yet mercy be
          triumphant still. How was that? The Lord Jesus interposes, the
          days-man, the dear Redeemer! He saw God wielding his flaming sword,
          and his hand taking hold of vengeance; the Lord Jesus Christ saw the
          sword ready to be sheathed in the blood of the offender; when no eye
          could pity, when no angel or archangel could rescue, just as God was,
          as it were, about to give the fatal blow, just as the knife was put to
          the throat of the offender, the Son of God, the eternal Logos, says,
          "Father, spare the sinner; let him not die; Father, Father, O hold thy
          hand, withdraw thy sword, for I come to do thy will; man has broken
          thy law, and violated thy covenant: I do not deny but man deserves to
          be damned forever; but, Father, what Adam could not do, it thou wilt
          prepare me a body, I in the fullness of time will go, and die for him;
          he has broken thy law, but I will go and keep it, that thy law may be
          honored; I will give a perfect unsinning obedience to all thy
          commandments; and that thou mayst justify ungodly creatures, I will
          not only go down and obey thy law, but I will go down and bleed; I
          will go down and die: here I am; I will step in between thee and
          sinners, and be glad to have thy sword sheathed in my heart's blood
          for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fullness of time descends the eternal Logos, "In the fullness
          of time God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to
          redeem them that are under the law from the curse of it, being made a
          curse for us." The Lord Jesus Christ being clothed in human nature,
          fulfilled all righteousness; he submitted to every institution of God,
          and was pleased to obey the whole moral law; and afterwards, O can we
          think of it, O can you hear of it, without a heart leaping with joy,
          at last the Lord Jesus bled and died! And when he was just expiring,
          just as he was about to bow down his head, and give up the ghost, what
          do ye think he said? He said, "It is finished!" As much as to say,
          "Now the arduous work, the difficult task I had undertaken, blessed be
          God, is not completely over; all the demands of the law are finished;
          now God's justice is satisfied; now a new and living way is opened by
          my blood to the holiest of all for poor sinners."
        </p>
        <p>
          So that when Christ's righteousness is here spoken of, we are to
          understand "Christ's obedience and death," all that Christ has done,
          and all that Christ has suffered for an elect world, for all that will
          believe on him. And blessed be God for this righteousness! Blessed be
          God for the epithet which in the text is put to this righteousness; it
          might be called a blessed righteousness, it might be called a glorious
          righteousness, it might be called an invaluable righteousness; but the
          angel calls it an everlasting righteousness: God give you to take the
          comfort of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I am to show, on what account, this righteousness is here
          called an everlasting righteousness; and pray why do you think is
          Christ's righteousness called an everlasting righteousness?
        </p>
        <p>I suppose it is called an everlasting righteousness,</p>
        <p>
          First, Because Christ's righteousness was intended by the great God to
          extend to mankind even from eternity. All of you know, that old love
          is the best love. When we have an old acquaintance, a friend, that has
          loved us for many years, indeed that love is sweet: though we may love
          new friends, yet when an old friend and a new friend meet together, we
          may say, that the old is better. Now this should endear God to us, to
          think that from all the ages of eternity God had thoughts of you; God
          intended the Lord Jesus Christ to save your souls and mine: hence it
          is, that God, to endear Jeremiah to him, tells him, I have love thee
          with an everlasting love. Hence it is, that the Lord Jesus when he
          calls his elect people up to heaven, says, "Come, ye blessed of my
          Father;" what follows? "receive the kingdom prepared for you;" how
          long? "from the foundation of the world." All that we receive in time;
          all the streams that come to our souls, are but so many steams flowing
          from that inexhaustible fountain, God's electing, God' s sovereign,
          God' s distinguishing, God's everlasting love; and, therefore, the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ may properly be called an everlasting
          righteousness, because God intended it from everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, It is called an everlasting righteousness, because the
          efficacy of Christ's death took place immediately upon Adam's fall.
          Christianity, in one sense, is as old as the creation. Great Professor
          Franck, of Germany, says, "That Christ is the sum and substance of all
          righteousness." Mr. Henry observes, "That the Lord Jesus Christ is the
          treasure hid in the field of the Old Testament, under the types and
          shadows of the Mosaic dispensation." We have the Sun of Righteousness
          shining in his full meridian in the New Testament dispensation." We
          have the Sun of Righteousness shining in his full meridian in the New
          Testament dispensation. Now the righteousness of Jesus Christ, may be
          called an everlasting righteousness, because all the saints that have
          been saved, or that ever will be saved, are all saved by the
          righteousness of Christ. A great many censorious people are mighty
          inquisitive to know, what will become of the heathens, that never
          heard of Jesus Christ. I would say to such persons, as the Lord Jesus
          Christ did to another curious inquirer, "What is that to thee? Follow
          thou me." Pray, for what should you and I trouble ourselves about the
          heathens? Are not we heathens? It is too true, that we have too much
          of a heathens temper and practice with us. But why should we lost our
          time in inquiring about what will become of the heathen, and not
          rather inquire what will become of our own souls? We may be sure God
          will deal with heathens according to their light: if he has given them
          no revelation, they will not be judged by a revelation; if they have
          not had a law, they will be judged without law. But as for the Jews
          and Gentiles, who have the gospel revealed to them, however Deists may
          argue contrary to it; however they may set up reason in opposition to
          divine revelation; we may be sure none were ever saved, or will be
          saved, but by the righteousness of Christ. It was through faith in
          him, that Abel was saved; it was through the sacrifice of Jesus
          Christ, that Abraham was accepted, and that all the prophets of old
          were accepted; and there is none other name given under heaven,
          whereby we can be saved, but that of Christ. And therefore, since
          persons under the law, and under the gospel, are to be saved only
          through Christ; therefore, Christ's righteousness may properly be
          called an everlasting righteousness. But this is not all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, The righteousness of Jesus Christ, is not only to be called
          an everlasting righteousness, because that all persons under the law
          and all persons under the gospel, are saved by it; but because the
          efficacy thereof, blessed be God for it! Is to continue till time
          shall be no more. Blessed be God for Jesus Christ! The efficacy of
          whose blood, death, and atonement, is as great and as effectual now to
          the salvation of poor sinners, as when he bowed his blessed head, and
          gave up the ghost: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
          forever;" and whosoever believes on him, now, whosoever comes to, and
          accepts of him, shall now see his power, shall taste of his grace, and
          shall be actually saved by him, the save as if he had been in company
          with those who saw him expiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, Christ's righteousness may be called an everlasting
          righteousness, because the benefit of it is to endure to everlasting
          life. Indeed, some people tell us, that a person may be in Christ
          today, and go to the devil tomorrow: but, blessed be God, ye have not
          so learned Christ! No, my dear friends, thanks be to God for that
          divine text, "There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
          Jesus." Though God's people may fall foully; and though many are full
          of doubts and fears, and say, "One day I shall fall by the hands of
          Saul;" however your poor souls may be harassed, yet no wicked devil,
          nor your own depraved heart, shall be able to separate you from the
          love of God: God has loved you, God has fixed his heart upon you, and
          having loved his own, he loves them unto the end. The Lord of life and
          of glory, the blessed Jesus, will never cease loving you, till he hath
          loved and brought you to heaven; when he will rejoice, and say,
          "Behold me, O my Father, and the dear children that thou hast given
          me; thou gavest them me; thine they were, I have bought them with my
          blood, I have won them with my sword and with my bow, and I now will
          wear them as so many jewels of my crown." Therefore, Jesus Christ's
          righteousness may be called an everlasting righteousness, because
          those who once take hold of, and are interested in it, shall be saved
          everlastingly by Christ: "It is God that justifies us, (says St. Paul)
          who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is
          risen again." He gives devils the challenge, "O death, where is thy
          sting, O grave, where is thy victory? Who shall separate us from the
          love of God? I am persuaded that neither death nor life, neither
          principalities nor powers, nor any other creature, shall ever be able
          to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
          Lord." Those whom God justifies, he also glorifies. And because Christ
          lives, blessed be God, we shall live also. I know not what you may
          say; but though I trust I have felt the grace of Christ every day for
          fresh strength as if I had never believed before: and if I was to
          depend upon my own faithfulness, and not the faithfulness of the Son
          of God, I am sure I should soon desert the Lord Jesus Christ. But
          glory be to God, he is faithful that hath promised! Glory be to God,
          our salvation depends not upon our own free will, but upon God's free
          grace! Here is a sure bottom; the believer may build upon it; let the
          storms blow as long and as high as they please, they may make the poor
          creature tremble, but blessed be God, they never shall be able to take
          him off the foundation; though they may shake him, they shall only
          shake off his corruption: and I believe all that fear God, will be
          glad to part with it. On all these accounts, Christ's righteousness
          may be called an everlasting righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is said, in my text, that Jesus was to bring it in. What are
          we to understand by his bringing it in? Our Lord's promulgating and
          proclaiming it to the world. Indeed, it was brought in under the law,
          but then it was brought in under types and shadows, and most of the
          Jews looked no further. But Jesus Christ brought life and immortality
          to light by the gospel. The light of Moses was only twilight; the
          light of the gospel, is like the sun at noon-day, shining in his full
          meridian. Therefore, Jesus Christ may be said to bring in this
          everlasting righteousness, because he proclaimed it to the world, and
          commanded it to be preached, that God sent his Son into the world,
          that the world through him might be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, The Lord Jesus Christ brought in this righteousness, as he
          wrought it out for sinners upon the cross. Some Antinomians, for want
          of a proper distinction, run into a grievous error, telling us,
          Because God intended to justify by the righteousness of Jesus Christ,
          therefore man is justified from all eternity: which is absurd: a
          person cannot be justified, till he is actually existing; therefore,
          though man is justified, as it lies in God's mind from all eternity,
          yet it was not actually brought in till the Lord Jesus Christ
          pronounced those blessed words, "It is finished;" the grand
          consummation! Then Jesus brought it in. A new and a living way was to
          be opened to the Holy of Holies, for poor sinners, by the blood of
          Christ. But I do not think that the expression, brought in, is to be
          limited to this sense, though I suppose it is the primary one; it
          implies not only Christ's bringing it into the world, as promulgating,
          and having it written in the word of God, and as having wrought it out
          for sinners in his life, and on the cross; but he brings it in, in a
          manner, which, I pray God may take place this night; I mean, bringing
          it, by his blessed Spirit, into poor believers hearts. All that Christ
          hath done, all that Christ hat suffered, all Christ's active
          obedience, all Christ's passive obedience, will do us no good, unless
          by the Spirit of God, it is brought into our souls. As one expresses
          it, "An unapplied Christ is no Christ at all." To hear of a Christ
          dying for sinners, will only increase your damnation, will only sink
          you deeper into hell, unless we have ground to say, by a work of grace
          wrought in our hearts, that the Lord Jesus hath brought this home to
          us. Hence it is, that the Apostle, speaking of Christ, says, "Who love
          me, and gave himself for me." O that dear, that great, that little,
          but important word, me. Happy they, who can adopt the Apostle's
          language! Happy they that can apply it to their own heart; and when
          they hear that Christ has brought in an everlasting righteousness, can
          say, Blessed be God, it is brought in by the blessed Spirit to my
          soul!
        </p>
        <p>
          Are there any here that can go along with me on this doctrine? But why
          do I ask this question, when preaching to numbers, who, I hope, have
          tasted of the grace of God long ago? I do not know, I cannot
          distinguish you; you are just like other people, as to your looks and
          habits; but if I do not, and if your neighbors cannot know you, that
          great God, in whose presence you are, knows you; He, before whose
          tribunal we are shortly to appear, knows you. If Christ Jesus hath
          brought his everlasting righteousness into your heart; if it is
          applied by the Spirit of God to your soul, what shall I say to you? I
          will say as the Angel to John, "Come up hither," thou child of God!
          Come up hither, thou son, thou daughter of Abraham! Come and join with
          me, in calling upon angels and archangels, in calling upon the spirits
          of just men made perfect, to help thee to praise that loving Redeemer,
          that has brought in an everlasting righteousness. O was ever love like
          this! When Abraham was about to offer up his son, God said, "Now I
          know that thou lovest me, since thou hast not withheld thy son, thine
          only son from me." Now may each child of God say, "Now, O God, I know
          that thou hast loved me, since thou hast not withheld thy Son, thy
          dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, from dying for me." If thou hast got
          Christ brought into thy soul by faith, O look forward, look towards a
          happy eternity; O look towards those everlasting mansions, into which
          God will bring thee after death. My dear friends, I could say much
          from this text to comfort God's people: But
        </p>
        <p>
          I must address myself to you, poor souls, who cannot say, that this
          righteousness has been brought home to your souls; but if it was never
          brought home before, may God, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, bring
          it home now! Are any of you depending upon a righteousness of your
          own? Do any of you here, think to save yourselves by your own doings?
          I say to you, as the Apostle said to one that offered money for a
          power to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost, your righteousness shall
          perish with you. Poor miserable creatures! What is there in your
          tears? What in your prayers? What in your performances, to appease the
          wrath of an angry God? Away from the trees of the garden; come, ye
          guilty wretches, come as poor, lost, undone, and wretched creatures,
          and accept of a better righteousness than your own. As I said before,
          so I tell you again, the righteousness of Jesus Christ is an
          everlasting righteousness: it is wrought out for the very chief of
          sinners. Ho, every one that thirsteth, let him come and drink of this
          water of life freely. Are any of you wounded by sin? Do any of you
          feel you have no righteousness of your own? Are any of you perishing
          for hunger? Are any of you afraid ye will perish forever? Come, dear
          souls, in all your rags; come, thou poor man; come, thou poor,
          distressed woman; you, who think God will never forgive you, and that
          your sins are too great to be forgiven; come, thou doubting creature,
          who art afraid thou wilt never get comfort; arise, take comfort, the
          Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of life, the Lord of glory, calls for
          thee: through his righteousness there is hope for the chief of
          sinners, for the worst of creatures. What if thou hadst committed all
          the sins in the world? What if thou hadst committed the sins of a
          thousand, what if thou hadst committed the sins of a million of
          worlds? Christ's righteousness will cover, the blood of the Lord Jesus
          Christ will cleanse, thee from the guilt of them all. O let not one
          poor soul stand at a distance from the Savior. My dear friends, could
          my voice hold out, was my strength equal to my will, I would wrestle
          with you; I would strive with arguments, till you came and washed in
          this blood of the Lamb; till you came and accepted of this everlasting
          righteousness. O come, come! Now, since it is brought into the world
          by Christ, so in the name, in the strength, and by the assistance of
          the great God, I bring it now to the pulpit; I now offer this
          righteousness, this free, this imputed, this everlasting righteousness
          to all poor sinners that will accept of it. For God's sake accept it
          this night: you do not know but ye may die before tomorrow. How do he
          know, but while I am speaking, a fit of the apoplexy may seize, and
          death arrest you? O my dear friends, where can ye go? Where will ye
          appear? How will ye stand before an angry God, without the
          righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ put upon your souls? Can ye
          stand in your own rags? Will ye dare to appear before a
          heart-searching God, without the apparel of your elder brother? If ye
          do, I know your doom: Christ will frown you into hell: "Depart,
          depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire," shall be your portion.
          Think, I pray you, therefore, on these things; go home, go home, go
          home, pray over the text, and say, "Lord God, thou hast brought an
          everlasting righteousness into the world by the Lord Jesus Christ; by
          the blessed Spirit bring it into my heart!" then, die when ye will, ye
          are safe; if it be tomorrow, ye shall be immediately translated into
          the presence of the everlasting God: that will be sweet! Happy they
          who have got this robe on; happy they that can say, "My God hath loved
          me, and I shall be loved by him with an everlasting love!" That every
          one of you may be able to say so, may God grant, for the sake of Jesus
          Christ, the dear Redeemer; to whom be glory for ever. Amen.<br />
