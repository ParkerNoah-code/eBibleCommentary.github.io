        <p>Acts 26:28 -- "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."</p>
        <p>
          The chapter, out of which the text is taken, contains an admirable
          account which the great St. Paul gave of his wonderful conversion from
          Judaism to Christianity, when he was called to make his defense before
          Festus a Gentile governor, and king Agrippa. Our blessed Lord had long
          since foretold, that when the Son of man should be lifted up, "his
          disciples should be brought before kings and rulers, for his name's
          sake, for a testimony unto them." And very good was the design of
          infinite wisdom in thus ordaining it; for Christianity being, from the
          beginning, a doctrine of the Cross, the princes and rulers of the
          earth thought themselves too high to be instructed by such mean
          teachers, or too happy to be disturbed b such unwelcome truths; and
          therefore would have always continued strangers to Jesus Christ, and
          him crucified, had not the apostles, by being arraigned before them,
          gained opportunities of preaching to them "Jesus and the
          resurrection." St. Paul knew full well that this was the main reason,
          why his blessed Master permitted his enemies at this time to arraign
          him at a public bar; and therefore, in compliance with the divine
          will, thinks it not sufficient, barely to make his defense, but
          endeavors at the same time to convert his judges. And this he did with
          such demonstration of the spirit, and of power, that Festus, unwilling
          to be convinced by the strongest evidence, cries out with a loud
          voice, "Paul, much earning doth make thee mad." To which the brave
          apostle (like a true follower of the holy Jesus) meekly replies, I am
          not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and
          soberness." But in all probability, seeing king Agrippa more affected
          with his discourse, and observing in him an inclination to know the
          truth, he applies himself more particularly to him. "The king knoweth
          of these things; before whom also I speak freely; for I am persuaded
          that none of these things are hidden from him." And then, that if
          possible he might complete his wished-for conversion, he with an
          inimitable strain of oratory, addresses himself still more closely,
          "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest
          them." At which the passions of the king began to work so strongly,
          that he was obliged in open court, to own himself affected by the
          prisoner's preaching, and ingenuously to cry out, "Paul, almost thou
          persuadest me to be a Christian."
        </p>
        <p>
          Which words, taken with the context, afford us a lively representation
          of the different reception, which the doctrine of Christ's ministers,
          who come in the power and spirit of St. Paul, meets with now-a-days in
          the minds of men. For notwithstanding they, like this great apostle,
          "speak forth the words of truth and soberness;" and with such energy
          and power, that all their adversaries cannot justly gainsay or resist;
          yet, too many, with the noble Festus before-mentioned, being like him,
          either too proud to be taught, or too sensual, too careless, or too
          worldly-minded to live up to the doctrine, in order to excuse
          themselves, cry out, that "much learning, much study, or, what is more
          unaccountable, much piety, hath made them mad." And though, blessed be
          God! All do not thus disbelieve our report; yet amongst those who
          gladly receive the word, and confess that we speak the words of truth
          and soberness, there are so few, who arrive at any higher degree of
          piety than that of Agrippa, or are any farther persuaded than to be
          almost Christians, that I cannot but think it highly necessary to warn
          my dear hearers of the danger of such a state. And therefore, from the
          words of the text, shall endeavor to show these three things:
        </p>
        <p>First, What is meant by an almost-Christian.</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, What are the chief reasons, why so many are no more than
          almost Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I shall consider the ineffectualness, danger, absurdity, and
          uneasiness which attends those who are but almost Christians; and then
          conclude with a general exhortation, to set all upon striving not only
          be almost, but altogether Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. And, First, I am to consider what is meant by an almost Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          An almost Christian, if we consider him in respect to his duty to God,
          is one that halts between two opinions; that wavers between Christ and
          the world; that would reconcile God and Mammon, light and darkness,
          Christ and Belial. It is true, he has an inclination to religion, but
          then he is very cautious how he goes too far in it: his false heart is
          always crying out, Spare thyself, do thyself no harm. He prays indeed,
          that "God's will may be done on earth, as it is in heaven." But
          notwithstanding, he is very partial in his obedience, and fondly hopes
          that God will not be extreme to mark every thing that he willfully
          does amiss; though an inspired apostle has told him, that "he who
          offends in one point is guilty of all." But chiefly, he is one that
          depends much on outward ordinances, and on that account looks upon
          himself as righteous, and despises others; though at the same time he
          is as great a stranger to the divine life as any other person
          whatsoever. In short, he is fond of the form, but never experiences
          the power of godliness in his heart. He goes on year after year,
          attending on the means of grace, but then, like Pharaoh's lean kine
          [cow?], he is never the better, but rather the worse for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you consider him in respect to his neighbor, he is one that is
          strictly just to all; but then this does not proceed from any love to
          God or regard to man, but only through a principle of self-love:
          because he knows dishonesty will spoil his reputation, and
          consequently hinder his thriving in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is one that depends much upon being negatively good, and contents
          himself with the consciousness of having done no one any harm; though
          he reads in the gospel, that "the unprofitable servant was cast into
          outer darkness," and the barren fig-tree was cursed and dried up from
          the roots, not for bearing bad, but no fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is no enemy to charitable contributions in public, if not too
          frequently recommended: but then he is unacquainted with the kind
          offices of visiting the sick and imprisoned, clothing the naked, and
          relieving the hungry in a private manner. He thinks that these things
          belong only to the clergy, though his own false heart tells him, that
          nothing but pride keeps him from exercising these acts of humility;
          and that Jesus Christ, in the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, condemns
          persons to everlasting punishment, not merely for being fornicators,
          drunkards, or extortioners, but for neglecting these charitable
          offices, "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, he shall set
          the sheep on his right-hand, and the goats on his left. And then shall
          he say unto them on his left hand, depart from me, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an
          hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
          drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed
          me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they
          also say, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or a-thirst, or a
          stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto
          thee? Then shall he answer them, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye
          have not done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it
          not unto me: and these shall go away into everlasting punishment unto
          me: and these shall go away into everlasting punishment." I thought
          proper to give you this whole passage of scripture at large, because
          our Savior lays such a particular stress upon it; and yet it is so
          little regarded, that were we to judge by the practice of Christians,
          one should be tempted to think there were no such verses in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to proceed in the character of an Almost Christian: If we consider
          him in respect of himself; as we said he was strictly honest to his
          neighbor, so he is likewise strictly sober in himself: but then both
          his honesty and sobriety proceed from the same principle of a false
          self-love. It is true, he runs not into the same excess of riot with
          other men; but then it is not out of obedience to the laws of God, but
          either because his constitution will not away with intemperance; or
          rather because he is cautious of forfeiting his reputation, or
          unfitting himself for temporal business. But though he is so prudent
          as to avoid intemperance and excess, for the reasons before-mentioned;
          yet he always goes to the extremity of what is lawful. It is true, he
          is no drunkard; but then he has no Christian self-denial. He cannot
          think our Savior to be so austere a Master, as to deny us to indulge
          ourselves in some particulars: and so by this means he is destitute of
          a sense of true religion, as much as if he lived in debauchery, or any
          other crime whatever. As to settling his principles as well as
          practice, he is guided more by the world, than by the word of God: for
          his part, he cannot think the way to heaven so narrow as some would
          make it; and therefore considers not so much what scripture requires,
          as what such and such a good man does, or what will best suit his own
          corrupt inclinations. Upon this account, he is not only very cautious
          himself, but likewise very careful of young converts, whose faces are
          set heavenward; and therefore is always acting the devil's part, and
          bidding them spare themselves, though they are doing no more than what
          the scripture strictly requires them to do: The consequence of which
          is, that "he suffers not himself to enter into the kingdom of God, and
          those that are entering in he hinders."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus lives the almost Christian: not that I can say, I have fully
          described him to you; but from these outlines and sketches of his
          character, if your consciences have done their proper office, and made
          a particular application of what has been said to your own hearts, I
          cannot but fear that some of you may observe some features in his
          picture, odious as it is, to near resembling your own; and therefore I
          cannot but hope, that you will join with the apostle in the words
          immediately following the text, and wish yourselves "to be not only
          almost, but altogether Christians."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I proceed to the second general thing proposed; to consider the
          reasons why so many are no more than almost Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And the first reason I shall mention is, because so many set out
          with false notions of religion; though they live in a Christian
          country, yet they know not what Christianity is. This perhaps may be
          esteemed a hard saying, but experience sadly evinces the truth of it;
          for some place religion in being of this or that communion; more in
          morality; most in a round of duties, and a model of performances; and
          few, very few acknowledge it to be, what it really is, a thorough
          inward change of nature, a divine life, a vital participation of Jesus
          Christ, an union of the soul with God; which the apostle expresses by
          saying, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." Hence it
          happens, that so many, even of the most knowing professors, when you
          come to converse with them concerning the essence, the life, the soul
          of religion, I mean our new birth in Jesus Christ, confess themselves
          quite ignorant of the matter, and cry out with Nicodemus, "How can
          this thing be?" And no wonder then, that so many are only almost
          Christians, when so many know not what Christianity is: no marvel,
          that so many take up with the form, when they are quite strangers to
          the power of godliness; or content themselves with the shadow, when
          they know so little about the substance of it. And this is one cause
          why so many are almost, and so few are altogether Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A second reason that may be assigned why so many are no more than
          almost Christians, is a servile fear of man: multitudes there are and
          have been, who, though awakened to a sense of the divine life, and
          have tasted and felt the powers of the world to come; yet out of a
          base sinful fear of being counted singular, or contemned by men, have
          suffered all those good impressions to wear off. It is true, they have
          some esteem for Jesus Christ; but then, like Nicodemus, they would
          come to him only by night: they are willing to serve him; but then
          they would do it secretly, for fear of the Jews: they have a mind to
          see Jesus, but then they cannot come to him because of the press, and
          for fear of being laughed at, and ridiculed by those with whom they
          used to sit at meat. But well did our Savior prophesy of such persons,
          "How can ye love me, who receive honor one of another?" Alas! have
          they never read, that "the friendship of this world is enmity with
          God;" and that our Lord himself has threatened, "Whosoever shall be
          ashamed of me or of my words, in this wicked and adulterous
          generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in
          the glory of his Father and of his holy angels?" No wonder that so
          many are no more than almost Christians, since so many "love the
          praise of men more than the honor which cometh of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A third reason why so many are no more than almost Christians, is a
          reigning love of money. This was the pitiable case of that forward
          young man in the gospel, who came running to our blessed Lord, and
          kneeling before him, inquired "what he must do to inherit eternal
          life;" to whom our blessed Master replied, "Thou knowest the
          commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal:" To
          which the young man replied, "All these have I kept from my youth."
          But when our Lord proceeded to tell him, "Yet lackest thou one thing;
          Go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor; he was grieved at
          that saying, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions!"
          Poor youth! He had a good mind to be a Christian, and to inherit
          eternal life, but thought it too dear, if it could be purchased at no
          less an expense than of his estate! And thus many, both young and old,
          now-a-days, come running to worship our blessed Lord in public, and
          kneel before him in private, and inquire at his gospel, what they must
          do to inherit eternal life: but when they find they must renounce the
          self- enjoyment of riches, and forsake all in affection to follow him,
          they cry, "The Lord pardon us in this thing! We pray thee, have us
          excused."
        </p>
        <p>
          But is heaven so small a trifle in men's esteem, as not to be worth a
          little gilded earth? Is eternal life so mean a purchase, as not to
          deserve the temporary renunciation of a few transitory riches? Surely
          it is. But however inconsistent such a behavior may be, this
          inordinate love of money is too evidently the common and fatal cause,
          why so many are no more than almost Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor is the love of pleasure a less uncommon, or a less fatal cause
          why so many are no more than almost Christians. Thousands and ten
          thousands there are, who despise riches, and would willingly be true
          disciples of Jesus Christ, if parting with their money would make them
          so; but when they are told that our blessed Lord has said, "Whosoever
          will come after him must deny himself;" like the pitiable young man
          before-mentioned, "they go away sorrowful"" for they have too great a
          love for sensual pleasures. They will perhaps send for the ministers
          of Christ, as Herod did for John, and hear them gladly: but touch them
          in their Herodias, tell them they must part with such or such a
          darling pleasure; and with wicked Ahab they cry out, "Hast thou found
          us, O our enemy?" Tell them of the necessity of mortification and
          self-denial, and it is as difficult for them to hear, as if you was to
          bid them "cut off a right-hand, or pluck out a right-eye." They cannot
          think our blessed Lord requires so much at their hands, though an
          inspired apostle has commanded us to "mortify our members which are
          upon earth." And who himself, even after he had converted thousands,
          and was very near arrived to the end of his race, yet professed that
          it was his daily practice to "keep under his body, and bring it into
          subjection, lest after he had preached to others, he himself should be
          a cast-away!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But some men would be wiser than this great apostle, and chalk out to
          us what they falsely imagine an easier way to happiness. They would
          flatter us, we may go to heaven without offering violence to our
          sensual appetites; and enter into the strait gate without striving
          against our carnal inclinations. And this is another reason why so
          many are only almost, and not altogether Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The fifth and last reason I shall assign why so many are only
          almost Christians, is a fickleness and instability of temper.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been, no doubt, a misfortune that many a minister and sincere
          Christian has met with, to weep and wail over numbers of promising
          converts, who seemingly began in the Spirit, but after a while fell
          away, and basely ended in the flesh; and this not for want of right
          notions in religion, nor out of a servile fear of man, nor from the
          love of money, or of sensual pleasure, but through an instability and
          fickleness of temper. They looked upon religion merely for novelty, as
          something which pleased them for a while; but after their curiosity
          was satisfied, they laid it aside again: like the young man that came
          to see Jesus with a linen cloth about his naked body, they have
          followed him for a season, but when temptations came to take hold on
          them, for want of a little more resolution, they have been stripped of
          all their good intentions, and fled away naked. They at first, like a
          tree planted by the water-side, grew up and flourished for a while;
          but having no root in themselves, no inward principle of holiness and
          piety, like Jonah's gourd, they were soon dried up and withered. Their
          good intentions are too like the violent motions of the animal spirits
          of a body newly beheaded, which, though impetuous, are not lasting. In
          short, they set out well in their journey to heaven, but finding the
          way either narrower or longer than they expected, through an
          unsteadiness of temper, they have made an eternal halt, and so
          "returned like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow that was washed
          to her wallowing in the more!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But I tremble to pronounce the fate of such unstable professors, who
          having put their hands to the plough, for want of a little more
          resolution, shamefully look back. How shall I repeat to them that
          dreadful threatening, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no
          pleasure in him:" And again, "It is impossible (that is, exceeding
          difficult at least) for those that have been once enlightened, and
          have tasted of the heavenly gift, and the powers of the world to come,
          if they should fall away, to be renewed again unto repentance." But
          notwithstanding the gospel is so severe against apostates, yet many
          that begun well, through a fickleness of temper, (O that none of us
          here present may ever be such) have been by this means of the number
          of those that turn back unto perdition. And this is the fifth, and the
          last reason I shall give, why so many are only almost, and not
          altogether Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Proceed we now to the general thing proposed, namely, to consider
          the folly of being no more than an almost Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And the First proof I shall give of the folly of such a proceeding
          is, that it is ineffectual to salvation. It is true, such men are
          almost good; but almost to hit the mark, is really to miss it. God
          requires us "to love him with all our hearts, with all our souls, and
          with all our strength." He loves us too well to admit any rival;
          because, so far as our hearts are empty of God, so far must they be
          unhappy. The devil, indeed, like the false mother that came before
          Solomon, would have our hearts divided, as she would have had the
          child; but God, like the true mother, will have all or none. "My Son,
          give me thy heart," thy whole heart, is the general call to all: and
          if this be not done, we never can expect the divine mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persons may play the hypocrite; but God at the great day will strike
          them dead, (as he did Ananias and Sapphira by the mouth of his servant
          Peter) for pretending to offer him all their hearts, when they keep
          back from him the greatest part. They may perhaps impose upon their
          fellow- creatures for a while; but he that enabled Elijah to cry out,
          "Come in thou wife of Jeroboam," when she came disguised to inquire
          about he sick son, will also discover them through their most artful
          dissimulations; and if their hearts are not wholly with him, appoint
          them their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But, Secondly, What renders an half-way-piety more inexcusable is,
          that it is not only insufficient to our own salvation, but also very
          prejudicial to that of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          An almost Christian is one of the most hurtful creatures in the world;
          he is a wolf in sheep's clothing: he is one of those false prophets,
          our blessed Lord bids us beware of in his sermon on the mount, who
          would persuade men, that the way to heaven is broader than it really
          is; and thereby, as it was observed before, "enter not into the
          kingdom of God themselves, and those that are entering in they
          hinder." These, these are the men that turn the world into a luke-warm
          Laodicean spirit; that hang out false lights, and so shipwreck
          unthinking benighted souls in their voyage to the haven of eternity.
          These are they who are greater enemies to the cross of Christ, than
          infidels themselves: for of an unbeliever every one will be aware; but
          an almost Christian, through his subtle hypocrisy, draws away many
          after him; and therefore must expect to receive the greater damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But, Thirdly, As it is most prejudicial to ourselves and hurtful to
          others, so it is the greatest instance of ingratitude we can express
          towards our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. For did he come down from
          heaven, and shed his precious blood, to purchase these hearts of ours,
          and shall we only give him half of them? O how can we say we love him,
          when our hearts are not wholly with him? How can we call him our
          Savior, when we will not endeavor sincerely to approve ourselves to
          him, and so let him see the travail of his soul, and be satisfied!
        </p>
        <p>
          Had any of us purchased a slave at a most expensive rate, and who was
          before involved in the utmost miseries and torments, and so must have
          continued for ever, had we shut up our bowels of compassion from him;
          and was this slave afterwards to grow rebellious, or deny giving us
          but half his service; how, how should we exclaim against his base
          ingratitude! And yet this base ungrateful slave thou art, O man, who
          acknowledgest thyself to be redeemed from infinite unavoidable misery
          and punishment by the death of Jesus Christ, and yet wilt not give
          thyself wholly to him. But shall we deal with God our Maker in a
          manner we would not be dealt with by a man like ourselves? God forbid!
          No. Suffer me, therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          To add a word or two of exhortation to you, to excite you to be not
          only almost, but altogether Christians. O let us scorn all base and
          treacherous treatment of our King and Savior, of our God and Creator.
          Let us not take some pains all our lives to go to haven, and yet
          plunge ourselves into hell as last. Let us give to God our whole
          hearts, and no longer halt between two opinions: if the world be God,
          let us serve that; if pleasure be a God, let us serve that; but if the
          Lord he be God, let us, O let us serve him alone. Alas! why, why
          should we stand out any longer? Why should we be so in love with
          slavery, as not wholly to renounce the world, the flesh, and the
          devil, which, like so many spiritual chains, bind down our souls, and
          hinder them from flying up to God. Alas! what are we afraid of? Is not
          God able to reward our entire obedience? If he is, as the almost
          Christian's lame way of serving him, seems to grant, why then will we
          not serve him entirely? For the same reason we do so much, why do we
          not do more? Or do you think that being only half religious will make
          you happy, but that going farther, will render you miserable and
          uneasy? Alas! this, my brethren, is delusion all over: for what is it
          but this half piety, this wavering between God and the world, that
          makes so many, that are seemingly well disposed, such utter strangers
          to the comforts of religion? They choose just so much of religion as
          will disturb them in their lusts, and follow their lusts so far as to
          deprive themselves of the comforts of religion. Whereas on the
          contrary, would they sincerely leave all in affection, and give their
          hearts wholly to God, they would then (and they cannot till then)
          experience the unspeakable pleasure of having a mind at unity with
          itself, and enjoy such a peace of God, which even in this life passes
          all understanding, and which they were entire strangers to before. It
          is true, it we will devote ourselves entirely to God, we must meet
          with contempt; but then it is because contempt is necessary to heal
          our pride. We must renounce some sensual pleasures, but then it is
          because those unfit us for spiritual ones, which are infinitely
          better. We must renounce the love of the world; but then it is that we
          may be filled with the love of God: and when that has once enlarged
          our hearts, we shall, like Jacob when he served for his beloved
          Rachel, think nothing too difficult to undergo, no hardships too
          tedious to endure, because of the love we shall then have for our dear
          Redeemer. Thus easy, thus delightful will be the ways of God even in
          this life: but when once we throw off these bodies, and our souls are
          filled with all the fullness of God, O! what heart can conceive, what
          tongue can express, with what unspeakable joy and consolation shall we
          then look back on our past sincere and hearty services. Think you
          then, my dear hearers, we shall repent we had done too much; or rather
          think you not, we shall be ashamed that we did no more; and blush we
          were so backward to give up all to God; when he intended hereafter to
          give us himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me therefore, to conclude, exhort you, my brethren, to have always
          before you the unspeakable happiness of enjoying God. And think
          withal, that every degree of holiness you neglect, every act of piety
          you omit, is a jewel taken out of your crown, a degree of blessedness
          lost in the vision of God. O! do but always think and act thus, and
          you will no longer be laboring to compound matters between God and the
          world; but, on the contrary, be daily endeavoring to give up
          yourselves more and more unto him; you will be always watching, always
          praying, always aspiring after farther degrees of purity and love, and
          consequently always preparing yourselves for a fuller sight and
          enjoyment of that God, in whose presence there is fullness of joy, and
          at whose right-hand there are pleasures for ever more. Amen! Amen!
