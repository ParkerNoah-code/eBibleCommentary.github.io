        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |The Lord our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not
          after the due order.| -- 1 Chron.15:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          LET me explain the events of which a summary is to be found in 2
          Samuel 6., and 1 Chronicles 13:and 15:The ark of the covenant was a
          kind of chest made of shittim wood, and lined within and without with
          gold. Within this ark were preserved the tables of stone, which were
          received from heaven by Moses when he was upon the mount. There also
          lay the golden pot that had the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded.
          Upon the lid of it were represented cherubic figures of angels; and
          between the wings of the cherubim, when the ark was at rest, there was
          seen that miraculously bright light, called the Shekinah, which was
          the token of the presence of the Most High God. The lid of the ark, as
          you will remember was called the mercy-seat. The whole ark was one of
          the most sacred things in the symbolic worship of the Jews because if
          they understood aright, it was to them the expression of God's
          dwelling with them, for where that ark was, God specially rested. Its
          lid being called the mercy seat, was the representation of Jesus
          Christ who is our ark -- the ark of the covenant in which God dwelt
          among men, and he is our mercy-seat by whom we have access to our
          Father, God. You will remember that after this ark was made in the
          wilderness, it was carefully kept in the secret place of the
          tabernacle, into which no man ever entered, except the high priest
          once in the year; and, then, not without blood. With his censor
          smoking, he made a thick cloud of incense, and then sprinkling the
          blood upon the mercy-seat, he ventured near to it -- but not without
          blood. That ark when it was removed was covered over, so that no human
          eye should ever see it; and it was carried by golden staves upon the
          shoulders of the Levites. It was by the presence of this ark that
          Jordan was driven back, and an easy passage was made for the children
          of Israel, when they entered into Canaan. The ark was in an evil day
          captured by the Philistines. But when they took it away into their
          country, wherever the ark went, it smote the Philistines with
          pestilence, until they were compelled to bring it back, for they
          cried, |Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to
          his own place, that it slay us not and our people: for there was a
          deadly destruction throughout all the city, the hand of God was very
          heavy there.| Placing the terrible captive upon a new cart, they left
          the oxen to bear it as they pleased, and by divine providence the ark
          was carried to Beth-shemesh. The men of Beth-shemesh struck with an
          evil curiosity, lifted up the lid and looked therein, and there fell
          many thousands of them dead for the impious presumption. The ark was
          then removed to Kirjath-jearim, and taken into the house of Abinadab,
          where it was preserved till the days of David, who desired to bring it
          up to the tabernacle which he had erected for it on the top of Mount
          Zion. The messengers hastened through all the land carrying the royal
          message, |Come up, ye tribes of Israel, and ye sons of Judah, gather
          yourselves together, and bring up the ark of the covenant of your God
          with music and with joy.| They came from every city, from the remotest
          ends of Judea, and from the borders of Egypt. But forgetful of the
          divine law, they took up the ark and put it on a new car or chariot
          which they had made for it. They thought, doubtless, it was too heavy
          for the priests to carry so many miles; or else, forgetful altogether
          of the divine law, they imitated the example of the Philistines. It is
          an evil hour for the people of God, when they set up their own
          judgment, and fail to yield implicit obedience to divine law. The ark
          is dragged by the oxen; but as there are no roads in the East, but
          only here and there a cart rut, the cart shakes, and the ark totters.
          Just when they come to the threshing floor of Chidon, there is a
          peculiarly boggy place in the road, and the car is almost upset; the
          ark is about to fall in the mire, so Uzzah thinks, and he puts out his
          hand, touches the ark to stop it, is rent in pieces, and falls a
          mangled corpse. The procession stops. They begin to weep; they cast
          dust mto the air; the king himself is angry, angry with his God. He
          thinks he is dealing hardly with them; and the ark is taken into
          Obed-edom's house, and all their joy is suspended.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have before you now the picture. I shall want you to look at it,
          first, in detail, to bring out certain truths which I think it teaches
          to us; and then, I shall want you to regard the picture as a whole, to
          run your eye along the whole length of the canvas, and sea the
          fullness of its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, we shall take THE PICTURE IN ITS DETAIL.</p>
        <p>
          1. The first observation I make upon it is this, that God's judgment
          of sin must differ exceedingly from ours. Who among us when be has
          read this narrative has not thought that Uzzah was treated hardly?
          What! was he not actuated with a proper motive? He could not bear the
          idea that the ark should fall into the mire, and therefore he put out
          his hand. Why, to our mode of thinking, it seemed to be but a small
          offense, and the motive so excellent that it might almost be
          justified. I am sure there is a disposition in us to excuse Uzzah, and
          to think that this judgment which came upon him was not deserved. Let
          me remark here, that I am not sure Uzzah suffered any eternal
          punishment as the result of it. Perhaps, he was a gracious man; and
          God, may smite even his own children with death as a chastisement, and
          yet their souls may he saved eternally. We have nothing to look at
          except what God did with him in this world. He struck him dead in this
          world for touching the ark. Verily, my brethren, the Lord seeth not as
          man seeth. We cannot readily perceive the evil, but there was sin or
          else he would not have punished it. He is too good, too just to smite
          any man more severely than he deserves. God never exaggerates our
          sins. He looks at them as they are. And what think you, my hearers, if
          the mere sin of touching the ark brought death upon the man, what
          would our sins have brought on us if God had |laid justice to the line
          and righteousness to the plummet?| Why, we have all of us done ten
          thousand times worse than Uzzah. Nay, some of you are living in the
          commission of sin to this very day. You have never repented of your
          sins, but you love your evil ways, and, though warned many times, (not
          like Uzzah, who was taken away with a stroke,) though warned many
          times, you still persevere in your iniquities. Oh, must not God's
          patience be pressed down under your sins? Must he not have become as
          Amos hath it, like a cart that is full of sheaves, the axles whereof
          are ready to break? and then you sink and sink for ever into the pit
          of eternal wrath. It seems strange that Eve's taking the apple should
          be the ruin of the entire world; that the mere violation of a sacred
          tree should bring death into the world, with all its train of woe. But
          this arises from the fact that we do not know how black a thing sin
          is. The least sin is so great an evil, so excessively black an
          abomination, that God were just if he smote us all to hell the moment
          we had thought an idle thought, or had uttered a single wrong word.
          Sin is an immeasurable evil. Man cannot weigh it. It is a gulf without
          a bottom. It is a desperate evil, the desperateness of which we shall
          never know, unless, as God forbid, we should ever come to feel its
          terror in the pit of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this lesson lies upon the very surface of the narrative, that
          we do not know how bad a thing sin is, for if the mere act of touching
          the ark brought death on Uzzah, what a desperate evil sin must be!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But, again, we learn, in the second place, from this narrative --
          that all changes from the written revelation of God are wrong. There
          has sprung up in the Church of Christ an idea that there are many
          things taught in the Bible which are not essential; that we may alter
          them just a little to suit our convenience: that provided we are right
          in the fundamentals, the other things are of no concern and of no
          value whatever. Now, look at our picture, and let your mistake for
          ever be driven away. It did seem to the people of Israel but a very
          indifferent matter whether the ark was carried on men's shoulders, or
          whether it was dragged upon a cart. Why, they said, |It cannot matter.
          It is true God has told us that it is to be borne by the Levites, but
          what does that signify as long as it is carried? It will be all right.
          We will do the thing, and if we alter the mode, it will not signify
          very materially.| Yes, but it did signify, for it was through this
          alteration which they made in God's law that the ark first began to
          shake, and to totter, and then Uzzah was tempted to put forth his hand
          and touch it. So that the death of Uzzah was the punishment upon the
          whole people for having neglected to observe the minute laws of God in
          every particular. My brethren, when Moses built the tabernacle, he was
          not left to build it after his own whim And taste. Every tache and
          every loop, every board and every fillet, everything was marked down
          in the divine plan, and Moses must build everything according to the
          pattern which he had seen in the Mount. Now, this is the pattern for a
          Christian -- this book of God which lies before me. The New Testament
          of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is our only rule of practice. And
          ye think, do ye, that ye may alter some few things, that ye may change
          them to suit the climate, or to indulge your own ideas of taste or
          convenience? You fancy, that doctrine for instance, is not of such
          sublime importance -- that if a man does but preach the fundamentals,
          he may preach any other things he likes, and yet all will be well --
          that ceremonies, that Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for instance,
          are to be out, and hacked and fashioned, to suit modern fancies, and
          that they are not to be retained in their integrity according to
          apostolic rule and precedent? But this know, that the slightest
          violation of the divine law will bring judgments upon the Church, and
          has brought judgments, and is even at this day withholding God's hand
          from blessing us. For within a few years we might see all the kingdoms
          of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, if we
          would but carry God's ark as God would have it carried, instead of
          marring the gospel by human inventions, and leaving the simplicity of
          the gospel of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not going this morning to enter into particulars, but just to lay
          down the general fact, that whatever God has commanded is important,
          and that I have no right whatever to alter anything -- no, not the
          least thing, but to take the word just as it stands, just as God has
          revealed it to me, to be my rule of faith and practice. Ay, but there
          are some of you who never read your Bibles. You have a second-hand
          religion which you have borrowed from other people, you do not come to
          this Book to drink at the fountain head. Your grandmother thought so
          and so, and you think the same; your great grandfather went to church
          or to chapel, and that is your reason for going; but you have not come
          to God's Word to submit your judgment to it. The reason why there are
          so many sects now-a-days is just this. If we all come straightway to
          the Bible, we should come far nearer together than we are now. It is
          not likely we should all see eye to eye. You cannot make a dozen
          watches all tick to the same time, much less make a dozen men Al think
          the same thoughts. But, still, if we should all bow our thoughts to
          that one written Word, and would own no authority but the Bible the
          Church could not be divided, could not be cut in pieces as she now is.
          We come together when we come to the Word of God. But I am always
          answered when I talk about these things, |Well, but they are not
          essential.| Who told you they were not? |Now,| saith one, |we'll admit
          that the baptism of infants is not in the Bible, but it is not an
          essential thing; we may practice it, and no harm will come of it.| No,
          sirs; you have no right to alter a word of God's command; you have no
          right to turn aside in any respect, or in any manner. God's doctrines
          are to be preached as God delivers them, and his ordinances are to be
          practiced after his own mode and law. Woe worth the day when God's ark
          is put upon the chariot and dragged by oxen, instead of being carried
          upon the shoulders of men, who read God's Word, and take it as it
          stands, and then follow out what God commands them, and will not be
          led by the sleeve or by the nose by any man or set of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forget not this lesson brethren, for it is of the greatest importance
          to the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now, there is a third thing, and that is, that whenever the
          practices of Christians differ from Scripture they are sure to incur
          inconvenience. When the ark was carried on the shoulders of men, it
          did not matter whether it went up-hill or down-hill, rugged road or
          smooth, there was the ark carried in state like the litter of a king.
          But once put it on the cart -- although they thought it would look
          better -- then it went jolting here and jolting there, and threatening
          constantly to tumble into the mire. Whenever we alter one word of
          Scripture, we shall get ourselves into trouble. We may not see it at
          first, but we surely shall find it out by-and-bye. A minister, for
          instance, thinks, |Well, now, I must not preach all the doctrines of
          the Gospel. it would not suit my people, there is a great deacon
          sitting in the green pew in the corner, there is the squire of the
          parish, he would not like it if I were to be too severe on him.| Ah,
          my friend, alter one word, and you have fallen into a snare, you have
          entered a labyrinth, and God help you to find your way out again, for
          you will never be able to get through it alone. Stand to God's Word
          and you stand safely. Alter one dot of the i, one cross of the t, and
          you are nowhere at all; you are in an enemy's country, and you cannot
          defend yourself. When we have got Scripture to back us up we defy the
          world; but when we have nothing but our own whims or the work of some
          great preacher, or the decree of a council, or the tradition the
          Fathers, we are lost. we are trying to weave a rope of sand, we are
          building a house of cards, that must totter to the ground. The Bible,
          the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible is the religion of Christ's
          Church. And until we come back to that the Church will have to suffer.
          She will not carry the ark up to the hill of Zion; she will not see
          His kingdom come, or his will done in earth as it is in heaven, till
          she has done with those bullocks and that new cart, and goes back to
          the New Testament plan of keeping consistently to the truth as it is
          in Jesus, and contending earnestly for the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Furthermore, another thing lies upon the surface of this passage;
          namely, that one innovation upon sacred writ leads to another. A
          little error leads to a great one. Nobody ever intended that Uzzah
          should touch that ark. They had not a thought when they lifted it up
          and put it on the car that it would lead to poor Uzzah's death and
          that he would commit the sin of violating the ark, else surely they
          would have kept to the Scriptural plan. So there are some of you my
          dear brethren in Christ who are not quite right in your views of
          Scripture. Well, perhaps you think the same of me. We will speak of
          somebody else, then. There is a man in the world, whose views are not
          quite in consistency with Scripture. He says, |Well, it does not
          matter it is a little thing, a very little thing.| Yes but that little
          wrong thing leads to a great wrong thing. The sinner's path is down
          hill, and when you take one step in violation of Scripture precept,
          your next step is not only easy, but seems even to be forced upon you.
          Doubt election, you will soon doubt perseverance, and you may soon
          come to deny redemption. Where did the errors of the church of Rome
          come from? Were they all born in a day? No, they came by slow degrees.
          It happened thus: -- I will trace but one error, against which as a
          denomination we always bear our protest, and I only take that as a
          specimen of the whole. Among the early Christians, it was the practice
          to baptize those who believed in Christ Jesus, by immersing them in
          the water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
          Ghost. Well, the first wrong doctrine that started up, was the idea
          that perhaps there was some efficacy in the water. Next it followed
          that when a man was dying who had never been baptized he would perhaps
          profess faith in Christ, and ask that he might be baptized; but as he
          was dying they could not lift him from his bed, they therefore adopted
          sprinkling as being an easier method by which they might satisfy the
          conscience by the application of water. That done, there was but a
          step to the taking of little children into the church -- children,
          unconscious infants, who were received as being members of Christ's
          body; and thus infant sprinkling was adopted. The error came in by
          slow degrees -- not all at once. It would have been too glaring for
          the church to receive, if it had shown its head at one time with all
          its horns upon it. But it entered slowly and gradually, till it came
          to be inducted into the church. I do not know, an error which causes
          the damnation of more souls than that at the present-time. There are
          thousands of people who firmly believe that they shall go to heaven
          because they were sprinkled in infancy, have been confirmed, and have
          taken the Sacrament. Sacramental efficacy and baptismal regeneration,
          all spring from the first error of infant baptism. Had they kept to
          the Scripture, had the church always required faith before baptism,
          that error could not have sprung up. It must have died before the
          light of the truth, it could not have breathed, it could not have had
          a foothold in the Christian church. But one error must lead to another
          -- you never need doubt that. If you tamper with one truth of
          Scripture, he that tempts you to meddle with one, will tempt you to
          tamper with another, and there will be no end to it, till, at last,
          you will want a new Bible, a new Testament, and a new God. There is no
          telling where you will end when you have begun. I am speaking very
          pointedly and very plainly this morning, on a subject which very
          seldom comes in my way. But I must be clear in my language when I do
          speak about it, for I do not often make allusions to this truth. Judge
          me as I judge others. You tell me, if I make one step in error, you do
          not know how far I may go. I believe you. Believe me also when I say
          the same. Let us both go to Scripture, let us stand only by this. I
          like your Prayer Book well enough, but not so well as my Bible. I
          respect your Church decrees, but not so as I venerate this Book. I
          believe what your minister says, so far as it is consistent with this
          Book. Believe me so far, but not one inch further. Have done with me
          when I have done with my Master. Think no more of any man you hear,
          when he goes from the Scripture, and when he errs, than you would
          think of Satan himself; except this, pity him for his errors, but pin
          not your faith to his sleeve. Scripture, Scripture only, is the model
          doctrine, the model practice, the model experience of a Christian; and
          whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil.

          5. Having now dwelt upon these points, I will take one more, and then
          I will leave this looking at the picture in detail. It strikes me that
          on the very surface of this passage there is a refutation of a very
          common error, that if we do a thing from a right motive God accepts
          it, even though it is a wrong thing. The common error of the time is
          this, |Well,| says one, |I have no doubt that if a man is a good
          Mahomedan, and keeps up to what he knows, he will go to heaven.| |Ah,|
          says another, | and if he is a good Roman Catholic, and if he keeps up
          to what he knows he is safe.| |Ay,| says another, |we must not judge
          one another harshly; no doubt those who bow before Juggernaut, if they
          live up to what they know will be saved.| Do you take in the
          devil-worshippers and the snake-worshippers too? You must let them all
          in. You have opened your door wide enough to let them all come in. And
          the Thugs who are going about India cutting men's throats -- they do
          it as a matter of principle, it is a part of their religion, they
          consider it to be right -- do you think they will go to heaven because
          they have done what they thought is right? |No,| says one, |I will not
          go that length.| Yes, but if the principle is right in one case it is
          right in the other. A principle will go the whole way it will stretch
          in any direction, and be as applicable to one as to another. But it is
          ail deception and falsehood God has revealed to us the one true
          religion. and other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid.
          We are responsible to God for our faith; we are bound to believe what
          he tells us to believe, and our judgment is as much bound to submit to
          God's law as any other power of our being. When we come before God, it
          will be no excuse for us to say |My Lord, I did wrong, but I thought I
          was doing right.| |Yes, but I gave you my law. but you did not read
          it, or, if you read it, you read it so carelessly that you did not
          understand it, and then you did wrong, and you tell me you did it with
          a right motive. Ay, but it is of no avail whatever.| Just as in
          Uzzah's case, did it not seem the lightest thing in the world to put
          out his hand to prevent the ark from slipping off? Who could blame the
          man? But God had commanded that no unpriestly hand should ever touch
          it, and inasmuch as he did touch it, though it was with a right
          motive, yet Uzzah must die. God will have his laws kept. Besides, my
          dear brethren, I am not sure about the rightness of your motives after
          all. The State has issued a proclamation, it is engraven, according to
          the old Roman fashion, in brass. A man goes up with his file, and he
          begins working away upon the brass, erases here, and amends there.
          Says he, |I did that with a right motive, I didn't think the law a
          good one, I thought it was too old-fashioned for these times, and so I
          thought I would alter it a little, and make it better for the people.|
          Ah, how many have there been who have said, |The old puritanic
          principles are too rough for these times, we'll alter them, we'll tone
          them down a little.| What are you at, sir? Who art thou that darest to
          touch a single letter of God's Book which God has hedged about with
          thunder in that tremendous sentence, wherein he has written,
          |Whosoever shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
          plagues that are written in this book; and whosoever shall take away
          from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his
          part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city.| It becomes an
          awful thing when we come to think of it, for men not to form a right
          and proper judgment about God's Word, for man to leave a single point
          in it uncanvassed, a single mandate unstudied, lest we should lead
          others astray, while we ourselves are acting in disobedience to God.
          The fact is, there is one way to heaven, and there are not fifty ways;
          there is one gate to heaven, and there are not even two gates. Christ
          is the way. Trusting in Jesus is the path to Paradise. He that
          believeth not in Jesus must be damned. The religion of Christ is
          intolerant; not that it ever touches man in his flesh and blood, even
          if he rejects it, but it does not allow of a second method of
          salvation. It demands your full obedience, your child-like faith, or
          else it threatens you with the direst penalty, if you refuse to yield
          to it. That idea of free-thinking and the like, and the right of man
          to think as he likes, has no countenance in Scripture. We are bound to
          believe what God tells us; as he tells it to us; bound not to alter a
          single word, but to take the Bible as it is, or else deny it, and take
          the consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this seems to me to lay in the picture which we have before us of
          the death of Uzzah.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But leaving these points, which I thought to be very necessary for
          the warning of all Christians -- for judging with charity, we cannot
          believe that the errors which prevail among us, can have sprung up
          from attention to the Word -- they must have sprung up from the idea,
          that the little things of Christ were of no importance whatever I now
          come to the second point, which is to LOOK AT THE PICTURE AS A WHOLE.
          Here I have two pictures; one for the people of God, the other for the
          ungodly. I shall dwell but briefly upon the first, and at length on
          the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren in Jesus, despite our mistakes -- and we are mistaken in some
          things, God forgive us -- despite our mistakes, we are one in Jesus.
          Yet, though one in Christ Jesus, we should not think our errors to be
          unimportant, but should every one of us on his knees seek divine
          teaching, that we may be purged from every false way, and that we may
          be led in the way of divine obedience, even unto the end. I am sure my
          brethren in Jesus, that the one object of your life, as I can say it
          is the object of mine, is the bringing about the kingdom of our Lord
          and Savior Jesus Christ. We want to bring up the ark from its
          obscurity, into the place of glory. Every time we bend our knee, there
          is one prayer we never can forget: -- |Thy kingdom come, thy will be
          done on earth as it is in heaven.| Now, for eighteen hundred and sixty
          years, the church of Christ has been seeking to bring the kingdom of
          Christ on earth. Has it come? has it come? Yes blessed be God it has
          in its measure. Here in this land, and across the Atlantic, and in
          other nations, there are found many who love and serve our Master. But
          have we had full fruit for the eighteen hundred and sixty years of
          labor? I think not. Two hundred years after the death of Christ, I
          think I may say, the religion of Jesus was almost as powerful in
          numbers upon the face of the earth, as it is now. And all the time
          between -- God forbid that I should say it has been wasted -- has,
          nevertheless, been a period of going back, rather than advancing -- of
          retreat, rather than rushing victory. Now, how is this to be accounted
          for? Was there not that in the religion of Christ, which would push
          its enemies to the very ends of the earth? Let but Paul stand up in
          Rome, and though after awhile, his head is severed from his body, yet
          the very empire of the seven hills is made to totter while he speaks.
          Let others of the Apostles pass the pillars of Hercules, and come to
          Britain, and the Druid loses his power; those who bow before bloody
          gods that delight in human sacrifice renounce their idolatries, and
          churches are founded throughout England, Ireland and Scotland. They
          have but to enter a country, and that country yields. It is true the
          martyrs bleed, and the apostles die, and the confessors are burned,
          but the truth lives and conquers and overcomes. Within two or three
          centuries, the name of Jesus is better known than that of any man, and
          his religion has greater power than any other on the face of the
          earth. And here are we, now, sending out our missionaries everywhere,
          and what is the success? Thank God for what it is: it is an excellent
          reward for all our labor, and far more than we deserve. But there is
          not the power in our missionaries that there was in the apostles. Our
          victories of the church have not been like the victories of the olden
          times. Why is this? My theory to account for it is this. In the first
          place, the absence of the Holy Spirit in a great measure from us. But
          if you come to the root of it to know the reason, my fuller other
          answer is this: -- the church has forsaken her original purity, and,
          therefore, she has lost her power. If once we had done with everything
          erroneous, if by the unanimous will of the entire body of Christ,
          every evil ceremony, every ceremony not ordained of Scripture were
          lopped off and done with, if every doctrine were rejected which is not
          sustained by Holy Writ; if this church were pure and glean, her path
          would be onward, triumphant, victorious. She would set her feet on
          Brahma, and crush Vishnu beneath her feet. She would say to the moon
          of Mahomet, |Set for ever!| She would dash from his throne the Pope;
          she would rend up false religions by the roots; she would sit as
          empress of the earth, and Christ, her husband, would reign with her,
          and the tabernacles of God would be among men. But we art not pure; we
          are not clean; we cannot bring up the ark of God. Blessed be God, it
          still abides in Obed-Edom's house. True religion is to be found in the
          hearts of God's people, and in some churches the truth is still
          preserved; but till the whole church shall come forth clear as the
          moon, fair as the sun, she will never be terrible as an army with
          banners.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may seem to you to be of little consequence, but it really is a
          matter of life and death. I would plead with every Christian -- think
          it over, my dear brother. When some of us preach Calvinism, and some
          Arminianism, we cannot both be right; it is of no use trying to think
          we can be -- |Yes,| and |no,| cannot both be true. When some of us
          hold a Christian free of all authority but Christ; and others hold a
          state church; we cannot both be right anyhow. We may be both right in
          the grand things, but we cannot be right in everything, one or other
          of us must be wrong. When some sprinkle the infant, and others baptize
          the believer, we cannot both be right; it is idle for us to think so.
          Christ has not made a nondescript religion, that will hold all sorts
          of people in it, and yet all shall be alike obedient. Truth does not
          vacillate like the pendulum which shakes backwards and forwards. It is
          not like the comet, which is here, there, and everywhere. One must be
          right, the other wrong. It is not for me to pronounce who is right, or
          who is wrong. I am not infallible. It is for me to judge of Scripture,
          as in the sight of God, for myself. I beg you do the same, Do not
          think any error to be an unimportant one, but try the spirits, prove
          whether these things are so. I am quite sure that the best way to
          promote union is to promote truth. It will not do for us to be all
          united together by yielding to one another's mistakes. We are to be
          united heartily, I hope we are. We are to love each other in Christ;
          but we are not to be so united that we are not able to see each
          other's faults, and especially not able to see our own. No, purge the
          house of God, and then shall grand and blessed times dawn on us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now; having done with that subject, I turn to those of you who are
          not converted, but who are longing to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ
          preached. I think what I have already said to be important, but this
          last part of the service is all-important. My dear hearer, I will
          suppose that in your heart there is an anxious desire to be saved, but
          you do not understand the plan of salvation: I grieve for you; for if
          you do not understand it, even though you seek Christ, you will make
          many mistakes, and you will suffer much inconvenience. It was a right
          thing in David to wish to bring up the ark, but perhaps he was
          ignorant of the way to bring it, and see what inconvenience he had to
          suffer: the ark was jolted, the oxen shook it. Now if you are not
          clear as to the plan of salvation, you will have many jottings, much
          shaking, many doubts, many fears. Let me ask and intreat you, then, to
          search the Scriptures; for in therein ye think ye have eternal life,
          and they are they which testify of Christ; and let me beg you to
          endeavor, by God's help, ever to keep in your mind a clear view of the
          fact, that you are to be saved, if saved at all, by trusting in Jesus
          Christ, and in Jesus Christ alone. The plan of salvation is, |Trust in
          Jesus.| Make mistakes about other things, you will suffer
          inconvenience; but make a mistake here, and it will be fatal to you.
          Methinks I hear some man saying, |Sir, I have longed to be saved, but
          I am still uneasy and troubled in my mind, I think if I were to do
          good works, and then to save myself by them, I might trust in Christ.|
          Stand back, Uzzah, stand back, thou art about to touch the ark of God,
          beware, lest thou shouldst die while thou art doing it other mistakes
          will make you uneasy; that mistake will be fatal to you. Touch the
          atonement of Jesus Christ, and there is no salvation if you touch it
          with a legal hand, seeking to add to it your own self righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>|None but Jesus, none but Jesus,</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good.|</p>
        <p>
          He wants no help from you; leave him to do it all; take him as he is,
          and go to him just as you are; do not seek to bring anything, but go
          as you are, and you will be saved. Seek to help Christ, and saved you
          cannot be. Until you have done with that thought, you must abide in
          your sorrow, and in your death. No mixing with Jesus; he never came to
          be a make-weight. Christ must be all, and you must be nothing at all.
          If you attempt to patch his perfect robe that robe shall never cover
          your nakedness. It is begemmed with jewels; put one paste jewel of
          yours upon it, and it is not yours. You must have a whole Christ, and
          nothing but Christ. You know the old proverb, |Betwixt the two stools
          he came to the ground.| When a man hopes to rely partly on Christ, and
          partly on himself, he will come to the ground with a vengeance. Rest
          on Jesus simply, and you are saved; rest on Christ and self, and you
          are like Uzzah, you have touched the ark, you have sought to mingle
          man's works with God's works, man's merits with Christ's merits; and
          tremble, lest the wrath of God should come forth against you, and
          destroy you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after all, my dear friends, you have no merits. Christ freely
          offers himself to you, if you will take him for nothing. You thought
          to buy him with your merits. Why you have no merits. Shall I tell you
          a little parable which shall show you your position. There was a rich
          man who had a generous heart, and once upon a time he resolved to give
          a large estate to a poor neighbor, so he sent for him, and said, |My
          friend, I am willing to give you a large estate for nothing.| The man
          felt grateful and retired home, but as he lay in his bed he thought,
          |I should like that estate, but I should not like to be beholden to
          anybody for it; I think I will pay for it.| So he set out the next
          morning with a heavy bag on his back, and when he came to the rich
          man's door and the friend came out, he said, |Sir, I value your estate
          very highly; you promised to let me have it for nothing, but I do not
          want to be obliged to you, so I have brought a bag all full of gold to
          buy it with.| The rich man said, |I never offered to sell it to you; I
          said I would give it to you; but come, let us look at your bag of
          gold.| So the poor man opened wide the mouth of the sack; he blushed
          and stammered, and said, |Oh sir, be not angry with me; now I come to
          look at it; it is nothing but a bag of silver.| The friend said, |Look
          at it again.| He looked again and blushed, and cried, |Let not my lord
          be angry, but I find it is nothing but a bag of copper.| |Look once
          more,| said he. He looked once more into it, and he fell down on his
          knees, and said, |Forgive me, forgive me; I find, sir, it is a bag of
          filth. You see I have brought you a bag of filth with which to buy
          your rich estate.| You know the meaning of that parable, do you not?
          You have brought to God what you thought were good works, golden
          works; look at them you will see them pale before you, and you will
          say, |My Lord, they are not so good as I thought they were, they are
          only silver works after all.| Look at them again, and they will become
          dirty, frown, copper works. |Oh!| say you, |they are not worth more
          than a farthing now.| Look again, and you will see that your prayers,
          your tears, your good works, are nothing better than filth after all.
          They are only another form of sin, another shape of iniquity. Oh!
          sinner, take Christ as he is; take him now, just as thou art. The
          gospel is just this -- trust Christ and you are saved. Rely on what he
          did, and you are delivered. Just leave off trusting to any ceremonies,
          to any doctrines, to any forms, to any works, but rely on Jesus and
          you are saved. |Well,| says one, |but if I go on in sin.| You cannot
          go on in sin after you have relied on Jesus, that will stop you,
          nothing else can; but faith will. |No,| says another, |but I have
          nothing in the world; no reason why I should be saved, I have no good
          thing.| Just so, I know you have not; but still you are told to trust
          Jesus whether you have any good thing or not. Methinks I hear some one
          say, |I must not trust Jesus, I have no right to do it.| But, my dear
          friend, you are commanded to do it. |God commandeth all men everywhere
          to repent.| This is the commandment, that ye believe on Jesus Christ
          whom he hath sent. Is not this the very gospel -- |Believe on the Lord
          Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved?| Now what God commends me to do
          I have a right to do; it cannot be wrong for me to do what God tells
          me to do. The minister, who tells a man he has his right found in his
          own sense of need, makes the sinner look to himself; but if he tells
          him, |Feel or not feel, God has commanded you to believe,| that makes
          the sinner turn to Christ and Christ only, this turns his eye from
          himself to the Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, I will tell you a little anecdote which I have often told
          before; it brings to your mind more clearly than any other means, your
          right to believe in Christ. I am speaking to those who say, |I have no
          right to trust Christ.| But if Christ commands you to do it, and if
          moreover he tells you, |you are condemned already because you do not
          believe,| you certainly have a right to believe. Sitting one day in
          Court with a Judge, interesting myself with some trials that were
          going on, there was wanted a witness. I am not clear about his name,
          but I think it was Brown. So it was said from the Bench that Brown was
          wanted next. The usher down in the Court cried out |Brown!| Some one
          nearer the door cried, |Brown! | and I could hear them calling out in
          the street two or three times, |Brown! Brown I Brown!| The Court was
          very crowded. By-and-bye there came in at the Court door with a great
          deal of difficulty, a little, ugly, mean-looking creature. He came
          pushing and elbowing his way. There was a fine tall gentleman standing
          in the Court, looking on. He did not like to be pushed about, and he
          said in a very peremptory manner, |Who are you?| |Brown,| said the
          man, |I am Brown.| | Well,| but said the other, |Who is Brown?| |
          Nobody,| said he, |only I was told to come.| It was wonderful how
          everybody made way for Brown, because he was told to come. They just
          cleared a lane for him and I do not suppose for my lord and duke they
          would have made room -- they were so tightly packed: but Brown must
          come in anyhow, because he was wanted. It did not matter how poor he
          looked, how ragged, how greasy, how dirty, Brown was wanted and he had
          a right to come. So now, God commands you to trust Christ. But you
          say, |There is a great big sin standing up.| And he says, |Who are
          you?| You say, |A poor sinner.| |And what is a poor sinner?| says he.
          |Nothing at all,| you say; |but Jesus Christ told me to trust in him.
          If he is wrong I leave the blame with him, I will not keep back from
          him.| He says, |Leap into my arms.| I am at the top of a burning
          house, he cries, |leap, and I will catch you.| Then down I go. Dashed
          to pieces, or saved; I have no other way of salvation -- down I go
          into his arms. I am sinking, the floods are ready to swallow me up.
          Christ says, |Lay hold of that rope.| It looks a frail rope, but I lay
          hold of it. Sink or swim I will not lay hold of anything else, but
          that and that alone, and I am safe. Do that, poor sinner, whoever you
          may be, if you have not entered a place of worship for the last six
          months, trust Christ now. Now, I beseech you, while the accepted hour
          is here, may God the Holy Spirit enable you to trust Christ; and,
          though you have come in here covered with sin, you may go out with
          your sin washed away, peace and joy in your heats, because the Spirit
          of God has sweetly led you to trust Jesus and you are saved.
        </p>
        <p>May God now add his blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>
