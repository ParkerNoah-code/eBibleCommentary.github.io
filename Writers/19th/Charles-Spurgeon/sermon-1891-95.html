          1. God does, however, exercise a providence over all things, and
          therefore He also gives counsel; and when giving counsel, He is
          present with those who attend to moral discipline. It follows then of
          course, that the things which are watched over and governed should be
          acquainted with their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain,
          but they have understanding derived from the providence of God. And,
          for this reason certain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to
          [sensual] allurements and voluptuousness, and were not led away to
          such a degree of superstition with regard to idols, being moved,
          though but slightly, by His providence, were nevertheless convinced
          that they should call the Maker of this universe the Father, who
          exercises a providence over all things, and arranges the affairs of
          our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, that they might remove the rebuking and judicial power from
          the Father, reckoning that as unworthy of God, and thinking that they
          had found out a God both without anger and [merely] good, they have
          alleged that one [God] judges, but that another saves, unconsciously
          taking away the intelligence and justice of both deities. For if the
          judicial one is not also good, to bestow favours upon the deserving,
          and to direct reproofs against those requiring them, he will appear
          neither a just nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good God, if
          he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send
          his goodness, will be out of the range of justice and goodness; and
          his goodness will seem imperfect, as not saving all; [for it should do
          so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by dividing God into two, maintaining
          one to be good and the other judicial, does in fact, on both sides,
          put an end to deity. For he that is the judicial one, if he be not
          good, is not God, because he from whom goodness is absent is no God at
          all; and again, he who is good, if he has no judicial power, suffers
          the same [loss] as the former, by being deprived of his character of
          deity. And how can they call the Father of all wise, if they do not
          assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is also one
          who tests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests,
          and justice follows the judicial faculty, that it may reach a just
          conclusion; justice calls forth judgment, and judgment, when it is
          executed with justice, will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father
          will excel in wisdom all human and angelic wisdom, because He is Lord,
          and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler over all. For He is good, and
          merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does goodness
          desert Him in the exercise of justice, nor is His wisdom lessened; for
          He saves those whom He should save, and judges those worthy of
          judgment. Neither does He show Himself unmercifully just; for His
          goodness, no doubt, goes on before, and takes precedency.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The God, therefore, who does benevolently cause His sun to rise
          upon all, and sends rain upon the just and unjust, shall judge those
          who, enjoying His equally distributed kindness, have led lives not
          corresponding to the dignity of His bounty; but who have spent their
          days in wantonness and luxury, in opposition to His benevolence, and
          have, moreover, even blasphemed Him who has conferred so great
          benefits upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed
          that the same God was both just and good, having power over all
          things, and Himself executing judgment, expressing himself thus, |And
          God indeed, as He is also the ancient Word, possessing the beginning,
          the end, and the mean of all existing things, does everything rightly,
          moving round about them according to their nature; but retributive
          justice always follows Him against those who depart from the divine
          law.| Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of the
          universe is good. |And to the good,| he says, |no envy ever springs up
          with regard to anything;| thus establishing the goodness of God, as
          the beginning and the cause of the creation of the world, but not
          ignorance, nor an erring Ã†on, nor the consequence of a defect, nor the
          Mother weeping and lamenting, nor another God or Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Well may their Mother bewail them, as capable of conceiving and
          inventing such things for they have worthily uttered this falsehood
          against themselves, that their Mother is beyond the Pleroma, that is
          beyond the knowledge of God, and that their entire multitude became a
          shapeless and crude abortion: for it apprehends nothing of the truth;
          it falls into void and darkness: for their wisdom (Sophia) was void,
          and wrapped up in darkness; and Horos did not permit her to enter the
          Pleroma: for the Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive them into the place
          of refreshment. For their father, by begetting ignorance, wrought in
          them the sufferings of death. We do not misrepresent [their opinions
          on] these points; but they do themselves confirm, they do themselves
          teach, they do glory in them, they imagine a lofty [mystery] about
          their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten without a
          father, that is, without God, a female from a female, that is,
          corruption from error.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We do indeed pray that these men may not remain in the pit which
          they themselves have dug, but separate themselves from a Mother of
          this nature, and depart from Bythus, and stand away from the void, and
          relinquish the shadow; and that they, being converted to the Church of
          God, may be lawfully begotten, and that Christ may be formed in them,
          and that they may know the Framer and Maker of this universe, the only
          true God and Lord of all. We pray for these things on their behalf,
          loving them better than they seem to love themselves. For our love,
          inasmuch as it is true, is salutary to them, if they will but receive
          it. It may be compared to a severe remedy, extirpating the proud and
          sloughing flesh of a wound; for it puts an end to their pride and
          haughtiness. Wherefore it shall not weary us, to endeavour with all
          our might to stretch out the hand unto them. Over and above what has
          been already stated, I have deferred to the following book, to adduce
          the words of the Lord; if, by convincing some among them, through
          means of the very instruction of Christ, I may succeed in persuading
          them to abandon such error, and to cease from blaspheming their
          Creator, who is both God alone, and the Father of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. Amen.
