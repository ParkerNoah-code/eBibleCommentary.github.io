          24. O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works! thou hast made all
          things in wisdom: the earth is full of thy riches.25. Great is this
          sea, and wide in extent; therein are things creeping innumerable, both
          small and great animals.26. There go the ships and the leviathan,
          which thou hast made to sport itself in it.

          24. O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy works The prophet does not make
          a full enumeration of the works of God, which would be an endless
          task, but only touches upon certain particulars, that every one may be
          led from the consideration of them to reflect the more attentively on
          that wisdom by which God governs the whole world, and every particular
          part of it. Accordingly, breaking off his description, he exclaims
          with admiration, -- How greatly to be praised are thy works! even as
          we then only ascribe to God due honor when seized with astonishment,
          we acknowledge that our tongues and all our senses fail us in doing
          justice to so great a subject. If a small portion of the works of God
          make us amazed, how inadequate are our feeble minds to comprehend the
          whole extent of them! In the first place, it is said, that God has
          made all things in wisdom, and then it is added, that the earth is
          full of his riches The mention of wisdom only is not intended to
          exclude the divine power, but the meaning is, that there is nothing in
          the world confused, -- that, so far from this, the vast variety of
          things mixed together in it are arranged with the greatest wisdom, so
          as to render it impossible for any thing to be added, abstracted, or
          improved. This commendation is set in opposition to the unhallowed
          imaginations, which often creep upon us when we are unable to discover
          the designs of God in his works, as if indeed he were subject to folly
          like ourselves, so as to be forced to bear the reprehension of those
          who are blind in the consideration of his works. The prophet also, by
          the same eulogium, reproves the madness of those who dream, that the
          world has been brought into its present form by chance, as Epicurus
          raved about the elements being composed of atoms. As it is an
          imagination more than irrational to suppose, that a fabric so elegant,
          and of such surpassing embellishment, was put together by the
          fortuitous concourse of atoms, the prophet here bids us attend more
          carefully to the wisdom of God, and to that wonderful skill which
          shines forth in the whole government of the world. Under riches are
          comprehended the goodness and beneficence of God; for it is not on his
          own account that he has so richly replenished the earth but on ours,
          that nothing which contributes to our advantage may be wanting. We
          ought to know that the earth does not possess such fruitfulness and
          riches of itself, but solely by the blessing of God, who makes it the
          means of administering to us his bounty.

          25. Great is this sea, and wide in extent After having treated of the
          evidences which the earth affords of the glory of God, the prophet
          goes down into the sea, and teaches us that it is a new mirror in
          which may be beheld the divine power and wisdom. Although the sea were
          not inhabited by fishes, yet the mere view of its vastness would
          excite our wonder, especially when at one time it swells with the
          winds and tempests, while at another it is calm and unruffled. Again,
          although navigation is an art which has been acquired by the skill of
          men, yet it depends on the providence of God, who has granted to men a
          passage through the mighty deep. But the abundance and variety of
          fishes enhance in no small degree the glory of God in the sea. Of
          these the Psalmist celebrates especially the leviathan or the whale
          because this animal, though there were no more, presents to our view a
          sufficient, yea, more than a sufficient, proof of the dreadful power
          of God, and for the same reason, we have a lengthened account of it in
          the book of Job. As its movements not only throw the sea into great
          agitation, but also strike with alarm the hearts of men, the prophet,
          by the word sport, intimates that these its movements are only sport
          in respect of God; as if he had said, The sea is given to the
          leviathans, as a field in which to exercise themselves.<br />
