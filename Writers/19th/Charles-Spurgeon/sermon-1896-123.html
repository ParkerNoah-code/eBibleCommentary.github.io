          12. What shall I render unto Jehovah? all his benefits are upon me.13.
          I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
          Jehovah.14. I will pay my vows to Jehovah now in the presence of all
          his people.

          12. What shall I render unto Jehovah? He now exclaims with devout
          admiration, that the multitude of God's benefits was greater than he
          could find language to give expression to the grateful emotions of his
          heart. The question is emphatic, What shall I render? and imports,
          that it was not the desire, but the means, of which he was destitute,
          to enable him to render thanks to God. Acknowledging his inability, he
          adopts the only means in his power, by extolling the grace of God as
          highly as he could. |I am exceedingly wishful to discharge my duty,
          but when I look around me, I find nothing which will prove an adequate
          recompense.| Some understand the phrase, upon me, to intimate, that
          David had the recollection of all the benefits which God bestowed on
          him deeply engraven upon his mind. Others, along with the LXX., supply
          the particle for, What shall I render unto Jehovah for all his
          benefits towards me? But it is much better to make the first clause of
          the verse a complete sentence, by putting a period after Jehovah.
          Because, after confessing his incompetency, or rather his having
          nothing to offer to God as a sufficient compensation for his benefits,
          he at the same time adds in confirmation of it, that he was laid under
          such obligations, not by one series of benefits only, but by a variety
          of innumerable benefits. |There is no benefit on account of which God
          has not made me a debtor to him, how should I have means of repaying
          him for them?| All recompense failing him, he has recourse to an
          expression of thanksgiving as the only return which he knows will be
          acceptable to God. David's example in this instance teaches us not to
          treat God's benefits lightly or carelessly, for if we estimate them
          according to their value, the very thought of them ought to fill us
          with admiration. There is not one of us who has not God's benefits
          heaped upon us. But our pride, which carries us away into extravagant
          theories, causes us to forget this very doctrine, which ought
          nevertheless to engage our unremitting attention. And God's bounty
          towards us merits the more praise, that he expects no recompense from
          us, nor can receive any, for he stands in need of nothing, and we are
          poor and destitute of all things.

          13. The cup of salvation He refers to a custom which was prevalent
          under the Law. For when they rendered solemn thanks to God, a feast
          was also appointed, at which, in token of their gladness, there was an
          holy libation. This being a symbol of their deliverance from Egyptian
          thraldom, is for that reason here called the cup of salvation The term
          to call upon, signifies to celebrate the name of God; and this he
          expresses more plainly, subsequently, by saying that he would pay his
          vows in the assembly of the faithful, the sanctuary alone being the
          place where sacrifices could be offered. The amount is, that the
          faithful need not be greatly perplexed about the way of performing
          their duties, God not demanding from them a return which he knows they
          are unable to give, but being satisfied with a bare and simple
          acknowledgment. The proper return is to own our obligation to him for
          every thing. If God deal so kindly and mercifully with us, and we fail
          in giving to him the tribute of praise for our deliverance which he
          claims, then our supineness becomes the more base. And certainly they
          are unworthy of the enjoyment, I say not of the riches of the world,
          but of the light of the sun and the air by which we breathe and live,
          who would rob the Author of them of the small return which so
          legitimately belongs to him. The Mosaic ritual has indeed been
          abrogated, and along with it the external libation referred to by
          David, yet the spiritual service, as we found in Psalm 50:23, |The
          sacrifice of praise shall glorify me,| is still in force. Let us,
          however, bear in mind, that God is lawfully praised by us, when we
          offer in sacrifice not only our tongues, but also ourselves, and all
          that we possess. And this not because God derives any profit from it,
          but because it is reasonable that our gratitude should manifest itself
          in this way.

          14 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah The steadfastness of his piety
          shines forth in this, that, in the midst of his dangers, he had vowed
          unto God. And now he proves that he by no means forgot these
          engagements, as most men do, who, when the hand of God lies heavy upon
          them, implore his help for a short time, but soon bury in oblivion the
          deliverance which they have received. The Holy Spirit, speaking of the
          true worship of God, very properly connects, by an indissoluble bond,
          these two parts of worship, |Call upon me in the day of trouble;| and,
          |after thy deliverance glorify me,| Psalm 50:15. If any regard it as
          an absurdity for the faithful to enter into covenant with God by
          making vows to him, to procure his approbation, my reply is, that they
          do not promise the sacrifice of praise, to soothe him by their
          flatteries, as if he were a mortal like themselves, or to bind him to
          them by proposing some reward, for David had previously protested that
          he would not offer any recompense. The design, then, and the use of
          vows is, first, That the children of God may have their hearts
          strengthened with the confidence of obtaining whatever they ask; and,
          secondly, That they may be stimulated the more to offer up their
          tribute of gratitude to God for his mercies. To aid the children of
          God in their infirmity, the privilege of vowing may surely be conceded
          to them, for by this means their most merciful Father condescends to
          allow them to enter into familiar converse with him, provided they
          make their vows for the object I have stated. Happen what may, nothing
          must be attempted without his permission. And hence the Papists appear
          the more ridiculous, who, under pretext of what is advanced in this
          place, defend all sorts of vows, however foolish and absurd and rashly
          made; as if drunkenness were lawful, because God permits us to eat.
