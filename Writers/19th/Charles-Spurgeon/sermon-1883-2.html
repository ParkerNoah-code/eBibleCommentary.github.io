        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1704)</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
          knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let
          patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
          wanting nothing.| -- James 1:2-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          James calls the converted among the twelve tribes his brethren.
          Christianity has a great uniting power: it both discovers and creates
          relationships among the sons of men. It reminds us of the ties of
          nature, and binds us with the bonds of grace. Every one that is born
          of the Spirit of God is brother to every other that is born of the
          same Spirit. Well may we be called brethren, for we are redeemed by
          one blood; we are partakers of the same life; we feed upon the same
          heavenly food; we are united to the same living head; we seek the same
          ends; we love the same Father: we are heirs of the same promises; and
          we shall dwell for ever together in the same heaven. Wherefore, let
          brotherly love continue; let us love one another with a pure heart
          fervently, and manifest that love, not in word only, but in deed and
          in truth. Whatever brotherhood may be a sham, let the brotherhood of
          believers be the most real thing beneath the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning with this word |brethren,| James shows a true brotherly
          sympathy with believers in their trials, and this is a main part of
          Christian fellowship. |Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil
          the law of Christ.| If we are not tempted ourselves at this moment,
          others are: let us remember them in our prayers; for in due time our
          turn will come, and we shall be put into the crucible. As we would
          desire to receive sympathy and help in our hour of need, let us render
          it freely to those who are now enduring trial. Let us remember those
          that are in bonds, as bound with them, and those that suffer
          affliction as being ourselves in the body. Remembering the trials of
          his brethren, James tries to cheer them, and therefore he says, |My
          brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers trials.| It is a
          part of our high calling to rise ourselves into confidence; and it is
          also our duty to see that none of our brethren despond, much less
          despair. The whole tendency of our holy faith is to elevate and to
          encourage. Grace breeds no sorrow, except the healthy sorrow which
          comes with saving repentance and leads to the joy of pardon: it comes
          not to make men miserable, but to wipe all tears from their eyes. Our
          dream is not of devils descending a dreary staircase to hell, but of
          angels ascending and descending upon a ladder, the top of which leads
          to the shining throne of God. The message of the gospel is one of joy
          and gladness, and were it universally understood and received this
          world would be no longer a wilderness, but it would rejoice and
          blossom as the rose. Let grace reign in all hearts, and this earth
          will become a temple filled with perpetual song; and even the trials
          of life will become causes of the highest joy, so beautifully
          described by James as |all joy,| as if every possible delight were
          crowded into it. Blessed be God, it is our work, not to upbraid, but
          to cheer all the brotherhood: we walk in a light which glorifies
          everything upon which it falls, and turns losses into gains. We are
          able in sober earnest to speak with the afflicted, and bid them be
          patient under the chastening hand of God; yea, to count it all joy
          when they fall into divers trials because those trials will work out
          for them such signal, such lasting good. They may be well content to
          sow in tears since they are sure to reap in joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without further preface we will come at once to the text; and observe
          that in speaking about affliction, for that is the subject of the
          text, the apostle notes, first, the essential point which is assailed
          by temptation, namely, your faith. Your faith is the target that all
          the arrows are shot at; the furnace is kindled for the trial of your
          faith. Notice, secondly, the invaluable blessing which is thus gained,
          namely, the proving of your faith, discovering whether it be the right
          faith or no. This proof of our faith is a blessing of which I cannot
          speak too highly. Then, thirdly, we may not overlook the priceless
          virtue which is produced by this process of testing, namely, patience;
          for the proving of your faith produces patience, and this is the
          soul's surest enrichment. Lastly, in connection with that patience we
          shall note the spiritual completeness which is thus promoted: -- |That
          ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing.| Perhaps you have
          noticed that little variations I have made in the text; but I am now
          following the Revised Version, which gives an admirable rendering. I
          will read it. |Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into
          manifold temptations; knowing that the proof of your faith worketh
          patience. And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be
          perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, let us think a little upon THE ESSENTIAL POINT WHICH IS
          ASSAILED by temptation or trial. It is your faith which is tried. It
          is supposed that you have that faith. You are not the people of God,
          you are not truly brethren unless you are believers. It is this faith
          of yours which is peculiarly obnoxious to Satan and to the world which
          lieth in the wicked one. If you had not faith they would not be
          enemies of yours; but faith is the mark of the chosen of God, and
          therefore his foes become the foes of all the faithful, spitting their
          venom specially upon their faith. God Himself hath put enmity between
          the serpent and the woman, between the serpent's seed and the woman's
          seed; and that enmity must show itself. The serpent bites at the heel
          of the true seed: hence mockings, persecutions, temptations, and
          trials are sure to beset the pathway to faith. The hand of faith is
          against all evil, and all evil is against faith. Faith is that blessed
          grace which is most pleasing to God, and hence it is the most
          displeasing to the devil. By faith God is greatly glorified, and hence
          by faith Satan is greatly annoyed. He rages at faith because he sees
          therein his own defeat and the victory of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the trial of your faith brings honour to the Lord, therefore
          the Lord Himself is sure to try it that out of its trial praise may
          come to his grace by which faith is sustained. Our chief end is to
          glorify God, and if our trials enable us more fully to answer the end
          of our being it is well that they should happen unto us. So early in
          our discourse we see reason to count it all joy when we fall into
          manifold trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by our faith that we are saved, justified, and brought near to
          God, and therefore it is no marvel that it is attacked. It is by
          believing in Christ that we are delivered from the reigning power of
          sin, and receive power to become the sons of God. Faith is as vital to
          salvation as the heart is vital to the body: hence the javelins of the
          enemy are mainly aimed at this essential grace. Faith is the standard
          bearer, and the object of the enemy is to strike him down that the
          battle may be gained. If the foundations be removed what can the
          righteous do? If the cable can be snapped whither will the vessel
          drift? All the powers of darkness which are opposed to right and truth
          are sure to fight against our faith, and manifold temptations will
          march in their legions against our confidence in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by our faith that we live; we began to live by it, and continue
          to live by it, for |the just shall live by faith.| Once let faith go
          and our life is gone; and hence it is that the powers which war
          against us make their main assault upon this royal castle, this key of
          the whole position. Faith is your jewel, your joy, your glory; and the
          thieves who haunt the pilgrim way are all in league to tear it from
          you. Hold fast, therefore, this your choice treasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by faith, too, that Christians perform exploits. If men of old
          wrought daring and heroic deeds it was by faith. Faith is the fighting
          principle and the conquering principle: therefore it is Satan's policy
          to slay it even as Pharaoh sought to kill the male children when
          Israel dwelt in Egypt. Rob a Christian of his faith and he will be
          like Samson when his locks were cut away: the Philistines will be upon
          him and the Lord will have departed from him. Marvel not if the full
          force of the current shall beat upon your faith, for it is the
          foundation of your spiritual house. Oh that your faith may abide
          steadfast and unmovable in all present trials, that so it may be found
          true in the hour of death and in the day of judgment. Woe unto that
          man whose faith fails him in this land of peace, for what will he do
          in the swelling of Jordan?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, think of how faith is tried. According to the text we are said to
          fall into |manifold temptations| or into |divers temptations| -- that
          is to say, we may expect very many and very different troubles. In any
          case these trials will be most real. The twelve tribes to whom this
          epistle was written were a specially tried people, for in the first
          place they were, as Jews, greatly persecuted by all other nations, and
          when they became Christians they were cruelly persecuted by their own
          people. A Gentile convert was somewhat less in peril than a Jewish
          Christian, for the latter was crushed between the upper and nether
          millstones of Paganism and Judaism. The Israelitish Christian was
          usually so persecuted by his own kith and kin that he had to flee from
          them, and whither could he go, for all other people abhorred the Jews?
          We are not in such a plight, but God's people even to this day will
          find that trial is no sham word. The rod in God's house is no toy to
          play with. The furnace, believe me, is no mere place of extra warmth
          to which you may soon accustom yourself: it is often heated seven
          times hotter, like the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar and God's children
          are made to know that the fire burns and devours. Our temptations are
          no inventions of nervousness nor hobgoblins of dreamy fear. Ye have
          heard of the patience of Job -- his was real patience, for his
          afflictions were real. Could each tried believer among us tell his own
          story I do not doubt we would convince all who heard us that the
          troubles and temptations which we have endured are no fictions of
          romance, but must be ranked among the stern realities of actual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ay, and note too, that the trials of Christians are such as would in
          themselves lead us into sin, for I take it that our translators would
          not have placed the word |temptation| in the text, and the
          Revisionists would not have retained it, if they had not felt that
          there was a colouring of temptation in its meaning, and that |trial|
          was hardly the word. The natural tendency of trouble is not to
          sanctify, but to induce sin. A man is very apt to become unbelieving
          under affliction: that is a sin. He is apt to murmur against God under
          it: that is a sin. He is apt to put forth his hand to some ill way of
          escaping from his difficulty: and that would be sin. Hence we are
          taught to pray, |Lead us not into temptation; because trial has in
          itself a measure of temptation|; and if it were not neutralized by
          abundant grace it would bear us towards sin. I suppose that every test
          must have in it a measure of temptation. The Lord cannot be tempted of
          evil, neither tempteth he any man; but this is to be understood of his
          end and design. He entices no man to do evil; but yet He tries the
          sincerity and faithfulness of men by placing them where sin comes in
          their way, and does its best or its worst to ensnare them: His design
          being that the uprightness of His servants may thus be proved, both to
          themselves and others. We are not taken out of this world of
          temptation, but we are kept in it for our good. Because our nature is
          depraved it makes occasions for sin, both out of our joys and our
          trials, but by grace we overcome the tendency of nature, and so derive
          benefit from tribulation. Do I not speak to many here who at times
          feel strong impulses towards evil, especially in the darksome hour
          when the spirit of evil walks abroad? Have you not been made to
          tremble for yourselves in season of fierce trial, for your feet were
          almost gone, your steps had well-nigh slipped. Is there any virtue
          that has not been weather-beaten? Is there any love that has not at
          times been so tried that it threatened to curdle into hate? Is there
          any good thing this side heaven which has marched all the way in
          silver slippers? Did ever a flower of grace blossom in this wretched
          clime without being tried with frost or blight? Our way is up the
          river; we have to stem the current, and struggle against a flood which
          would readily bear us to destruction. Thus, not only trials, but black
          temptations assail the Christian's faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to what shape they take, we may say this much: the trial or
          temptation of each man is distinct from that of every other. When God
          did tempt Abraham he was bidden to take his son, his only son, and
          offer him upon a mountain for a sacrifice. Nobody here was ever tried
          in that way: nobody ever will be. We may have the trial of losing our
          child, but certainly not the trial of having a command to offer him in
          sacrifice. That was a trial peculiar to Abraham: necessary and useful
          to him, though never proposed to us. In the case of the young man in
          the gospels, our Lord Jesus tried him with, |If thou wouldest be
          perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
          shalt have treasure in heaven.| Some have dreamed that it must
          therefore be the duty of everybody to part with their possessions: but
          this is idle. It would not be the duty of any man to offer up his only
          son; and it is not the duty of every man to part with all his goods.
          These were tests to particular persons; and others equally special and
          searching have been applied in other cases. We are not to try
          ourselves, nor to desire other men's trials; it will be well if we
          endure those which the Lord appoints for us, for they will be wisely
          chosen. That which would most severely test me would perhaps be no
          trial to you; and that which tries you might be no temptation to me.
          This is one reason why we often judge one another so severely, because
          feeling ourselves to be strong in that particular point we argue that
          the fallen one must have been strong in that point too, and therefore
          must have willfully and earnestly have determined to do wrong. This
          may be a cruel supposition. We hastily conclude that the temptation
          must have been as feeble in his case as it would have been in our own;
          which is a great mistake, for a temptation which to you or to me would
          be no temptation at all, may be to another individual, of a peculiar
          constitution and under singular circumstances, a most fierce and
          terrible blast from the adversary, before which he falls mournfully,
          but not with malice aforethought. Divers trials, says the apostle, and
          he knew what he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, dear friends, sometimes these divers trials derive great force
          from their seemingly surrounding us, and cutting off escape: James
          says, -- |Ye fall into divers temptations|: like men who fall into a
          pit, and do not know how to get out; or like soldiers who fall into an
          ambuscade; or travellers in the good old times when two or three
          footpaths surrounded them and made them feel that they had fallen into
          bad hands. The tempted see not which way to turn; they appear to be
          hemmed in; they are as a bird that is taken in the fowler's snare.
          This it is that makes calamity of our manifold temptations, that they
          hedge up our way, and unless faith finds the clue we wander in a
          thorny maze.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times temptation comes suddenly upon us, and so we fall into it.
          When we were at rest, and were quiet, suddenly the evil came, like a
          lion leaping from the thicket. When Job's children were eating and
          drinking in their elder brother's house, then suddenly a wind came
          from the wilderness, and the patriarch was bereaved: the cattle were
          ploughing, the sheep were grazing, the camels were at their service,
          and in a moment, by fire from heaven, and by robber bands, the whole
          of these possessions vanished. One messenger had not told his story
          before another followed at his heels; Job had no breathing time, the
          blows fell thick and fast. The trial of our faith is most severe when
          divers trials happen to us when we look not for them. It is not
          strange in the light of these things that James should say, |Count it
          all joy when ye fall into divers trials|?
        </p>
        <p>
          Those were the days of tumults, imprisonment, crucifixion, sword, and
          fire. Then the amphitheatre devoured Christians by thousands. The
          general cry was |The Christians to the lions!| Do you wonder if
          sometimes the bravest were made to say, Is our faith really true? This
          faith which is abhorred of all mankind, can it be divine? Has it come
          from God? Why, then, does He not interpose and deliver His people?
          Shall we apostatise? Shall we deny Christ and live, or shall we go on
          with our confession through innumerable torments even to a bloody
          death? Will fidelity answer after all? Is there a crown of glory? is
          there an eternity of bliss? Is there in very deed a resurrection of
          the dead? These questions came into men's minds then, and were fairly
          faced: the faith of martyrs was not taken up at second hand, or
          borrowed from their parents; they believed for themselves in downright
          earnest. Men and women in those days believed in such a way that they
          never flinched nor started aside from fear of death; indeed, they
          pressed forward to confess their faith in Jesus in such crowds that at
          last the heathen cried, |There must be something in it: it must be a
          religion of God, or how could these men so gladly bear their
          troubles?| This was the faith of God's elect, the work of the Holy
          Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, then, the main point of attack is our faith, and happy is the
          man whose shield can catch and quench all the fiery darts of the
          enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That we may make the text more clear we shall next notice THE
          INVALUABLE BLESSING WHICH IS GAINED BY THE TRIAL OF OUR FAITH. The
          blessing gained is this, that our faith is tried and proved. Two
          Sabbaths ago I addressed you upon the man whose bad foundations led to
          the overthrow of his house; and I know that many said after the
          sermon: -- |God grant that we may not be like him: may we have a firm
          foundation for our soul to rest on.| Then you went home, and you sat
          down and said, |Have I this sure foundation?| You began to question,
          argue, reason, and so on, and your design was a good one. But I do not
          reckon that much came of it; our own looking within seldom yields
          solid comfort. Actual trial is far more satisfactory; but you must not
          try yourself. The effectual proof is by trials of God's sending. The
          way of trying whether you are a good soldier is to go down to the
          battle: the way to try whether a ship is well built is, not merely to
          order the surveyor to examine her, but to
        </p>
        <p>
          send her to sea: a storm will be the best test of her staunchness.
          They have built a new lighthouse upon the Eddystone: how do we know
          that it will stand? We judge by certain laws and principles, and feel
          tolerably safe about the structure; but, after all, we shall know best
          if after-years when a thousand tempests have beaten upon the
          lighthouse in vain. We need trials as a test as much as we need divine
          truth as our food. Admire the ancient types placed in the ark of the
          covenant of old: two things were laid close together, -- the pot of
          manna and the rod. See how heavenly food and heavenly rule go
          together: how our sustenance and our chastening are equally provided
          for! A Christian cannot live without the manna nor without the rod.
          The two must go together. I mean this, that it is as great a mercy to
          have your salvation proved to you under trial as it is to have it
          sustained in you by the consolations of the Spirit of God. Sanctified
          tribulations work the proof of our faith, and this is more precious
          than that of gold which perisheth, though it be tried by fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, when we are able to bear it without starting aside, the trial
          proves our sincerity. Coming out of a trouble the Christian says to
          himself, |Yes, I held fast mine integrity, and did not let it go.
          Blessed be God, I was not afraid of threatening; I was not crushed by
          losses; I was kept true to God under pressure. Now, I am sure that my
          religion is not a mere profession, but a real consecration to God. It
          has endured the fire, being kept by the power of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it proves the truthfulness of our doctrinal belief. Oh, yes, you
          may say, |I have heard Mr. Spurgeon expound the doctrines, and I have
          believed them.| This is poor work; but if you have been sick, and
          found a comfort in those doctrines, then you are assured of their
          truth. If you have been on the borders of the grave, and the gospel
          has given you joy and gladness, then you know how true it is.
          Experimental knowledge is the best and surest. If you have seen others
          pass through death itself triumphantly you have said, |This is proof
          to me: my faith is no guess-work: I have seen for myself.| Is not this
          assurance cheaply purchased at any price? May we not count it all joy
          when the Lord puts us in the way of getting it? It seems to me that
          doubt is worse than trial. I had sooner suffer any affliction than be
          left to question the gospel or my own interest in it. Certainly it is
          a jewel worth purchasing even with our heart's blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, your own faith in God is proved when you can cling to Him under
          temptation. Not only your sincerity, but the divinity of your faith is
          proved; for a faith that is never tried, how can you depend upon it?
          But if in the darkest hour you have still said, |I cast my burden upon
          the Lord, and He will sustain me,| and you find He does sustain you,
          then is your faith that of God's elect. If in temptation you cry to
          God in prayer that you may keep your garment unspotted, and He helps
          you to do so, then also are you sure that yours is the faith which the
          Spirit begets in the soul. After a great fight of affliction, when I
          come forth a conqueror, I know that I do believe in God, and I know
          that this faith makes me a partaker of covenant blessings; from this I
          may fairly argue that my faith is of the right kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it especially sweet to learn the great strength of the Lord in
          my own weakness. We find out under trial where we are most weak, and
          just then in answer to prayer strength is given answerable to the
          need. The Lord suits the help to the hindrance, and puts the plaster
          on the wound. In the very hour when it is needed the needed grace is
          given. Does this not tend to breed assurance of faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a splendid thing to be able to prove even to Satan the purity of
          your motives. That was the great gain of Job. There was no question
          about his outward conduct, but the question was about his motive.
          |Ah,| says the devil, |he serves God for what he gets out of Him. Hast
          Thou not set a hedge about him and all that he has? His is cupboard
          love: he cares nothing for God Himself, he only cares for the reward
          of his virtue.| Well, he is tried, and everything is taken away, and
          when he cries, |Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him,| when he
          blesses the taking as well as the giving God, then the devil himself
          could not have the prudence to accuse him again. As to Job's own
          conscience, it would be quite settled and confirmed as to his pure
          love to God. My brethren, I reckon that the endurance of every
          imaginable suffering and trial would be a small price to pay for a
          settled assurance, which would for ever prevent the possibility of
          doubt. Never mind the waves if they wash you upon this rock.
          Therefore, when you are tempted, |Count it all joy| that you are
          tried, because you will thus receive a proof of your love, a proof of
          your faith, a proof of your being the true-born children of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          James says, |Count it.| A man requires to be trained to be a good
          accountant; it is an art which needs to be learned. What muddles some
          of us would make if we had to settle accounts and manage disbursements
          and incomings without the aid of a clerk! How we should get entangled
          with balances and deficits! We could much easier spend money than
          count it. But when a man once knows the science of book-keeping, and
          gets into the way of it, he readily arrives at the true position of
          affairs. He has learned to count, and no error escapes his eye. James
          gives us a ready reckoner, and teaches us in our troubles how to
          count. He sets before us a different kind of measure from that which
          carnal reason would use: the shekel of the sanctuary was very
          different from the shekel in common commerce, and so is the counting
          of faith far other than that of human judgment. He bids us take our
          pen and sit down quickly and write at his correct dictation. You are
          going to write down, |Manifold temptations;| that would be so much on
          the wrong side: but instead thereof he bids you set down the proving
          of your faith, and this one asset transforms the transaction into a
          substantial gain. Trials are like a fire; they burn up nothing in us
          but the dross, and they make the gold all the purer. Put down the
          testing process as a clear gain, and, instead of being sorry about it,
          count it all joy when ye fall into divers trials, for this bestows
          upon you a proof of your faith. So far there is sufficient ground for
          counting all trials joy. Now, let us go a little further.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let us think of THE PRICELESS VIRTUE WHICH IS PRODUCED BY TRIAL,
          namely, patience; for the proof of your |faith worketh patience.|
          Patience! We all have a large stock of it -- until we need it, and
          then we have none. The man who truly possesses patience is the man
          that has been tried. What kind of patience does he get by the grace of
          God? First, he obtains a patience that accepts the trials as from God
          without a murmur. Calm resignation does not come all at once; often
          long years of physical pain, or mental depression, or disappointment
          in business, or multiplied bereavements, are needed to bring the soul
          into full submission to the will of the Lord. After much crying the
          child is weaned; after much chastening the son is made obedient to his
          Father's will. By degrees we learn to end our quarrel with God, and to
          desire that there may not be two wills between God and ourselves, but
          that God's will may be our will. Oh, brother, if your troubles work
          you to that, you are a gainer, I am sure, and you may count them all
          joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next kind of patience is when experience enables a man to bear
          ill-treatment, slander, and injury without resentment. He feels it
          keenly, but he bears it meekly. Like his Master, he opens not his
          mouth to reply, and refuses to return railing for railing.
          Contrariwise he gives blessing in return for cursing; like the
          sandal-wood tree which perfumes the axe which cuts it. Blessed is that
          holy charity which hopeth all things, endureth all things, and is not
          easily provoked. Ah, friend, if the grace of God by trial shall work
          in you the quiet patience which never grows angry, and never ceases to
          love, you may have lost a trifle of comfort, but you have gained a
          solid weight of character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The patience which God works in us by tribulation also takes another
          form, namely, that of acting without undue haste. Before wisdom has
          balanced our zeal we are eager to serve God all in a hurry, with a
          rush and a spurt, as if everything must be done within the hour or
          nothing would ever be accomplished. We set about holy service with
          somewhat more of preparedness of heart after we have been drilled in
          the school of trial. We go steadily and resolutely about work for
          Jesus, knowing what poor creatures we are, and what a glorious Master
          we serve. The Lord our God is in no hurry because He is strong and
          wise. In proportion as we grow like the Lord Jesus we shall cast aside
          disturbance of mind and fury of spirit. His was a grand life-work, but
          He never seemed to be confused, excited, worried, or hurried, as
          certain of His people are. He did not strive nor cry, nor cause His
          voice to be heard in the streets. He knew His hour was not yet come,
          and there were so many days in which He could work, and therefore He
          went steadily on till He had finished the work which His Father had
          given Him to do. That kind of patience is a jewel more to be desired
          than the gem which glitters on the imperial brow. Sometimes we blunder
          into a deal of mischief, making more haste than speed; and we are sure
          to do so when we forget to pray, and fail to commit our matters into
          the Divine hands. We may run with such vehemence that we may stumble,
          or lose our breath: there may be in our random efforts as much undoing
          as doing, for want of possessing our souls in patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is a grand kind of patience, too, when we can wait without
          unbelief. Two little words are good for every Christian to learn and
          to practise -- pray and stay. Waiting on the Lord implies both praying
          and staying. What if the world is not converted this year! What if the
          Lord Jesus does not come to-morrow! What if still our tribulations are
          lengthened out! What if the conflict is continued! He that has been
          tried and by grace has obtained the true profit of his trials, both
          quietly waits and joyfully hopes for the salvation of God. Patience,
          brother! Is this high virtue scarce with thee? The Holy Spirit shall
          bestow it upon thee through suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          This patience also takes the shape of believing without wavering, in
          the very teeth of strange providences and singular statements, and
          perhaps inward misgivings. The established Christian says, |I believe
          my God, and therefore if the vision tarry I will wait for it. My time
          is not yet come. I am to have my worst things first and my best things
          afterwards, and so I sit me down at Jesus' feet and tarry his
          leisure.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Brothers and sisters, if, in a word, we learn endurance we have taken
          a high degree. You look at the weather-beaten sailor, the man who is
          at home on the sea: he has a bronzed face and mahogany-coloured flesh,
          he looks as tough as heart of oak, and as hardy as if he were made of
          iron. How different from us poor landsmen. How did the man become so
          inured to hardship, so able to breast the storm, so that he does not
          care whether the wind blows south-west or north-west? He can go out to
          sea in any kind of weather; he has his sea legs on: how did he come to
          this strength? By doing business in great waters. He could not have
          become a hardy seaman by tarrying on shore. Now, trial works in the
          saints that spiritual hardihood which cannot be learned in ease. You
          may go to school for ever, but you cannot learn endurance there: you
          may colour your cheek with paint, but you cannot give it that
          ingrained brown which comes of stormy seas and howling winds. Strong
          faith and brave patience come of trouble, and a few men in the church
          who have thus been prepared are worth anything in times of tempest. To
          reach that condition of firm endurance and sacred hardihood is worth
          all the expense of all the heaped-up troubles that ever come upon us
          from above or from beneath. When trial worketh patience we are
          incalculably enriched. The Lord give us more of this choice grace. As
          Peter's fish had the money in its mouth, so have sanctified trials
          spiritual riches for those who endure them graciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Lastly, all this works something better still, and this is our
          fourth head: THE SPIRITUAL COMPLETENESS PROMOTED. |That ye may be
          perfect and entire, wanting nothing.| Brethren, the most valuable
          thing a man can get in this world is that which has most to do with
          his truest self. A man gets a good house; well, that is something: but
          suppose he is in bad health, what is the good of his fine mansion? A
          man is well clothed and well fed: that is something: but suppose he
          shivers with ague, and has no appetite through indigestion. That
          spoils it all. If a man is in robust health this is a far more
          valuable boon. Health is far more to be prized than wealth, or honour,
          or learning: we all allow that, but then suppose that a man's
          innermost self is diseased while his body is healthy, so that he is
          disgraced by vice or fevered with passion, he is in a poor plight,
          notwithstanding that he has such a robust frame? The very best thing
          is that which will make the man himself a better man; make him right,
          and true, and pure, and holy. When the man himself is better, he has
          made an unquestionable gain. So, if our afflictions tend, by trying
          our faith, to breed patience, and that patience tends to make us into
          perfect men in Christ Jesus, then we may be glad of trials.
          Afflictions by God's grace make us all-around men, developing every
          spiritual faculty, and therefore they are our friends, our helpers,
          and should be welcomed with |all joy.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Afflictions find out our weak points, and this makes us attend to
          them. Being tried, we discover our failures, and then going to God
          about those failures we are helped to be perfect and entire, wanting
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, our trials, when blessed of God to make us patient, ripen
          us. I do not know how to explain what I mean by ripening, but there is
          a sort of mellowness about believers who have endured a great deal of
          affliction that you never meet in other people. It cannot be mistaken
          or imitated. A certain measure of sunlight is wanted to bring out the
          real flavour of fruits, and when a fruit has felt its measure of
          burning sun it develops a lusciousness which we all delight in. So is
          it in men and women: a certain amount of trouble appears to be needful
          to create a certain sugar of graciousness in them, so that they may
          contain the rich, ripe juice of a gracious character. You must have
          known such men and such women, and have said to yourselves, |I wish I
          could be like them, so calm, so quiet, so self-contained, so happy,
          and when not happy, yet so content not to be happy; so mature in
          judgment, so spiritual in conversation, so truly ripe.| This only
          comes to those in whom the proof of their faith works experience, and
          then experience brings forth the fruits of the Spirit. Dear brothers
          and sisters, there is a certain all-roundness of spiritual manhood
          which never comes to us except by manifold temptations. Let me attempt
          to show you what I mean. Sanctified trials produce a chastened spirit.
          Some of us by nature are rough and untender; but after awhile friends
          notice that the roughness is departing, and they are quite glad to be
          more gently handled. Ah, that sick chamber did the polishing; under
          God's grace, that depression of spirit, that loss, that cross, that
          bereavement, -- these softened the natural ruggedness, and made the
          man meek and lowly, like his Lord. Sanctified trouble has a great
          tendency to breed sympathy, and sympathy is to the church as oil to
          machinery. A man that has never suffered feels very awkward when he
          tries to sympathize with a tried child of God. He kindly does his
          best, but he does not know how to go to work at it; but those repeated
          blows from the rod make us feel for others who are smarting, and by
          degrees we are recognized as being the Lord's anointed comforters,
          made meet by temptation to succour those who are tempted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you never noticed how tried men, too, when their trouble is
          thoroughly sanctified, become cautious and humble? They cannot speak
          quite so fast as they used to do: they do not talk of being absolutely
          perfect, though thy are the very men who are Scripturally perfect;
          they say little about their doings, and much about the tender mercy of
          the Lord. They recollect the whipping they had behind the door from
          their Father's hands, and they speak gently to other erring ones.
          Affliction is the stone which our Lord Jesus throws at the brow of our
          giant pride, and patience is the sword which cuts off its head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those, too, are the kind of people who are most grateful. I have known
          what it is to praise God for the power to move one leg in bed. It may
          not seem much to you, but it was a great blessing to me. They that are
          heavily afflicted come to bless God for everything. I am sure that
          woman who took a piece of bread and a cup of water for her breakfast,
          and said, |What, all this, and Christ too!| must have been a tried
          woman, or she would not have exhibited so much gratitude. And that old
          Puritan minister was surely a tried man, for when his family had only
          a herring and a few potatoes for dinner, he said, |Lord, we bless Thee
          that Thou hast ransacked sea and land to find food for us this day.|
          If he had not been a tried man, he might have turned up his nose at
          the meal, as many do at much more sumptuous fare. Troubled men get to
          be grateful men, and that is no small thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rule, where God's grace works, these come to be hopeful men.
          Where others think the storm will destroy the vessel, they can
          remember storms equally fierce which did not destroy it, and so they
          are so calm that their courage keeps others from despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          These men, too, become unworldly men. They have had too much trouble
          to think that they can ever build their nest in this black forest.
          There are too many thorns in their nest for them to reckon that this
          can be their home. These birds of paradise take to their wings, and
          are ready to fly away to the land of unfading flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          And these much-tempted ones are frequently the most spiritual men, and
          out of this spirituality comes usefulness. Mr. Greatheart, who led the
          band of pilgrims up to the celestial city, was a man of many trials,
          or he would not have been fit to lead so many to their heavenly rest;
          and you, dear brother, if ever you are to be a leader and a helper, as
          you would wish to be, in the church of God, it must be by such means
          as this that you must be prepared for it. Do you not wish to have
          every virtue developed? Do you not wish to become a perfect man in
          Christ Jesus? If so, welcome with all joy divers trials and
          temptations; fly to God with them; bless Him for having sent them: ask
          Him to help you to bear them with patience, and then let that patience
          have its perfect work, and so by the Spirit of God you shall become
          |perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.| May the Comforter bless this
          word to your hearts, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
