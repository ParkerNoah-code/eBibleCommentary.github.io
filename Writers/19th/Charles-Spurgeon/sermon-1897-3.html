          |Sudden| is that which, contrary to expectation, and out of the, as
          yet, unmanifest, is brought into the manifest. But with regard to
          Christ's love of man, I think that the Word of God suggests even this,
          that the Superessential proceeded forth out of the hidden, into the
          manifestation amongst us, by having taken substance as man. But, He is
          hidden, even after the manifestation, or to speak more divinely, even
          in the manifestation, for in truth this of Jesus has been kept hidden,
          and the mystery with respect to Him has been reached by no word nor
          mind, but even when spoken, remains unsaid, and when conceived
          unknown.
