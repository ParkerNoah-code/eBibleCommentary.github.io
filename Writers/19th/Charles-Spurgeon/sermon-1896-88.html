A Song or Psalm of David.</p><p> 1. My heart is prepared, O God! my heart is prepared; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.2. Awake, psaltery and harp: I will arise at break of day.3. I will praise thee, O Jehovah! among the people; and sing unto thee among the nations: 4. Because thy goodness is great above the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.5. Be thou, O God! exalted above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth: 6. That thy chosen may be set free, save me by thy right hand, and hear me.7. God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth.8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head: Judah is my lawgiver. 9. Moab is the pot of my washing; over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistina I will triumph.10. Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will bring me even unto Edom? 11. Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst repulsed us? and wentest not out, O God! with our armies? 12. Lord us help out of our tribulations; because the help of man is vain.13. Through God we will do valiantly, and he shall trample under foot our enemies.</p><p></p><p> Because this psalm is composed of parts taken from the fifty-seventh and sixtieth psalms, it would be superfluous to repeat, in this place, what we have already said by way of exposition in those psalms. </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
