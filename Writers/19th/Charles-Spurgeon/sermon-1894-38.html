A Lyric Idyl</p><p> The Interrupted Visit</p><p></p><p> THE BRIDE</p><p> The voice of my beloved! behold he cometh,<br/>Leaping upon the mountains,<br/>Skipping upon the hills.<br/>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:<br/>Behold, he standeth behind our wall,<br/>He looketh in at the windows,<br/>He sheweth himself through the lattice.<br/>My beloved spake, and said unto me:<br/>|Rise up, my love, my fair one,<br/>And come away.</p><p> For, lo, the winter is past,<br/>The rain is over and gone;<br/>The flowers appear on the earth;<br/>The time of the singing of birds is come,<br/>And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;<br/>The fig tree ripeneth her green figs,<br/>And the vines are in blossom,<br/>They give forth their fragrance.<br/>Arise, my love, my fair one,<br/>And come away.</p><p> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock,<br/>In the covert of the steep place,<br/>Let me see thy countenance,<br/>Let me hear thy voice;</p><p> For sweet is thy voice,<br/>And thy countenance is comely.|</p><p> VOICES OF THE BROTHERS (<i>heard interrupting</i>)</p><p> |Take us the foxes,<br/>The little foxes that spoil the vineyards;<br/>For our vineyards are in blossom.|</p><p> * *<br/>*</p><p> <i>My beloved is mine, and I am his:</i><br/><i>He feedeth his flock among the lilies.</i><br/><i>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away,</i><br/><i>Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart</i> <i>Upon the mountains of separation.</i></p><p>The Happy Dream</p><p>By night, on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.<br/>I said, I will rise now, and go about the city,<br/>In the streets and in the broad ways,<br/>I will seek him whom my soul loveth:<br/>I sought him, but I found him not.</p><p>The watchmen that go about the city found me:<br/>To whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?<br/>It was but a little that I passed from them,<br/>When I found him whom my soul loveth:<br/>I held him, and would not let him go,<br/>Until I had brought him into my mother's house,<br/>And into the chamber of her that conceived me.</p><p>* *<br/>*</p><p><i>I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,</i><br/><i>By the roes, and by the hinds of the field,</i><br/><i>That ye stir not up, nor awaken love,</i><br/><i>Until it please.</i></p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
