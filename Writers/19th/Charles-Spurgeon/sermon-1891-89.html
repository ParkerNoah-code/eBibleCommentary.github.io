          1. But again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten
          by Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a
          state of death having been not as yet joined to the Word of God the
          Father, nor receiving liberty through the Son, as He does Himself
          declare: |If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.|
          But, being ignorant of Him who from the Virgin is Emmanuel, they are
          deprived of His gift, which is eternal life; and not receiving the
          incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and are debtors to
          death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says,
          mentioning His own gift of grace: |I said, Ye are all the sons of the
          Highest, and gods; but ye shall die like men.| He speaks undoubtedly
          these words to those who have not received the gift of adoption, but
          who despise the incarnation of the pure generation of the Word of God,
          defraud human nature of promotion into God, and prove themselves
          ungrateful to the Word of God, who became flesh for them. For it was
          for this end that the Word of God was made man, and He who was the Son
          of God became the Son of man, that man, having been taken into the
          Word, and receiving the adoption, might become the son of God. For by
          no other means could we have attained to incorruptibility and
          immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and
          immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and
          immortality, unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had
          become that which we also are, so that the corruptible might be
          swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the mortal by immortality, that
          we might receive the adoption of sons?

          2. For this reason [it is, said], |Who shall declare His generation?|
          since |He is a man, and who shall recognise Him?| But he to whom the
          Father which is in heaven has revealed Him, knows Him, so that he
          understands that He who |was not born either by the will of the flesh,
          or by the will of man,| is the Son of man, this is Christ, the Son of
          the living God. For I have shown from the Scriptures, that no one of
          the sons of Adam is as to everything, and absolutely, called God, or
          named Lord. But that He is Himself in His own right, beyond all men
          who ever lived, God, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the Incarnate
          Word, proclaimed by all the prophets, the apostles, and by the Spirit
          Himself, may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion
          of the truth. Now, the Scriptures would not have testified these
          things of Him, if, like others, He had been a mere man. But that He
          had, beyond all others, in Himself that pre-eminent birth which is
          from the Most High Father, and also experienced that pre-eminent
          generation which is from the Virgin, the divine Scriptures do in both
          respects testify of Him: also, that He was a man without comeliness,
          and liable to suffering; that He sat upon the foal of an ass; that He
          received for drink, vinegar and gall; that He was despised among the
          people, and humbled Himself even to death and that He is the holy
          Lord, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Beautiful in appearance, and
          the Mighty God, coming on the clouds as the Judge of all men; -- all
          these things did the Scriptures prophesy of Him.

          3. For as He became man in order to undergo temptation, so also was He
          the Word that He might be glorified; the Word remaining quiescent,
          that He might be capable of being tempted, dishonoured, crucified, and
          of suffering death, but the human nature being swallowed up in it (the
          divine), when it conquered, and endured [without yielding], and
          performed acts of kindness, and rose again, and was received up [into
          heaven]. He therefore, the Son of God, our Lord, being the Word of the
          Father, and the Son of man, since He had a generation as to His human
          nature from Mary -- who was descended from mankind, and who was
          herself a human being -- was made the Son of man. Wherefore also the
          Lord Himself gave us a sign, in the depth below, and in the height
          above, which man did not ask for, because he never expected that a
          virgin could conceive, or that it was possible that one remaining a
          virgin could bring forth a son, and that what was thus born should be
          |God with us,| and descend to those things which are of the earth
          beneath, seeking the sheep which had perished, which was indeed His
          own peculiar handiwork, and ascend to the height above, offering and
          commending to His Father that human nature (hominem) which had been
          found, making in His own person the first-fruits of the resurrection
          of man; that, as the Head rose from the dead, so also the remaining
          part of the body -- [namely, the body] of everyman who is found in
          life -- when the time is fulfilled of that condemnation which existed
          by reason of disobedience, may arise, blended together and
          strengthened through means of joints and bands by the increase of God,
          each of the members having its own proper and fit position in the
          body. For there are many mansions in the Father's house, inasmuch as
          there are also many members in the body.<br />
