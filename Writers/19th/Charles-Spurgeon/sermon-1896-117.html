          9. O Israel! Trust thou in Jehovah: he is their help and their
          shield.10. O house of Aaron! trust ye in Jehovah: he is their help and
          their shield.11. Ye that fear Jehovah! trust in Jehovah: he is their
          help and their shield.12. Jehovah has been mindful of us; he will
          bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house
          of Aaron.13. He will bless them that fear Jehovah, both the small with
          the great.14. Jehovah will add unto you, unto you and unto your
          children.15. Blessed are ye of Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.

          9 O Israel! trust thou in Jehovah The prophet again resumes the
          doctrinal point, that the genuine worshippers of God have no cause to
          fear that he will forsake or frustrate them in the time of need;
          because he is as much disposed to provide for their safety as he is
          furnished with power to do it. He proceeds, in the first place, to
          exhort all the Israelites generally to place their confidence in God;
          and, secondly, he addresses the house of Aaron in particular; and,
          thirdly, he sets down all who fear God. For this arrangement there was
          good cause. God had adopted indiscriminately all the people, to whom
          also his grace was offered, so that they were bound in common to place
          their hope in him. In accordance with this Paul says, that the twelve
          tribes of Israel wait for the promised deliverance, (Acts 26:7) The
          prophet, therefore, with great propriety first addresses Israel at
          large. But having in a peculiar manner set apart the Levites for
          himself, and more especially the priests of the house of Aaron, to
          take the precedence, and to preside over ecclesiastical matters, he
          demands more from them than from the common people; not that salvation
          was promised specially to them, but because it was proper that they
          who had the exclusive privilege of entering the sanctuary should point
          out the way to others. As if the prophet had said, Ye sons of Aaron,
          whom God hath chosen to be the teachers of religion to his people, be
          ye to others an example of faith, seeing that he hath so highly
          honored you in permitting you to enter his sanctuary.

          11. Ye who fear Jehovah! He does not speak of strangers, as some
          erroneously suppose, as if this were a prediction respecting the
          calling of the Gentiles. Connecting them with the children of Israel
          and with the sons of Aaron, they are of opinion that he refers to the
          heathens and to the uncircumcised who were not yet gathered into the
          sheepfold. By parity of reason one might infer, that the priests are
          not of the seed of Abraham, because they are separately mentioned. It
          is more probable that there is in these words a tacit correction of
          what he had said before, by which he makes a distinction between the
          genuine worshippers of God and those hypocrites who were the
          degenerate sons of Abraham. Not a few of the seed of Abraham according
          to the flesh having departed from the faith of their father, the
          prophet here restricts the promise to those who, having received it by
          faith, were worshipping God in purity. We now perceive the reason for
          his first addressing the Israelites, next the house of Aaron, and then
          the fearers of Jehovah It is as if a person in our times were to point
          his exhortation first to the whole body of the Church, and then come
          more particularly to the ministers and teachers, who ought to be
          ensamples to others. And as many falsely pique themselves upon the
          mere name of being connected with the Church, and hence deserve not to
          be classed with God's true followers, he expressly mentions the
          genuine and not the counterfeit worshippers of God.

          12 Jehovah hath remembered us Many render the term bless in the past
          tense, he has blessed, it being the design of the prophet, according
          to them, to propose the past experience of God's kindness as an
          encouragement to cherish good hope for the future: |We have already,
          from long experience, been taught how valuable the favor of our God
          is, because from this source alone have flowed our prosperity, our
          abundance, and our stability.| He assumes the principle, the truth of
          which ought to be admitted by all, that we neither enjoy prosperity
          nor happiness further than it pleases God to bless us. As often as the
          Israelites were rescued from manifold dangers, or succored in time of
          need, or treated in a friendly manner, so many palpable proofs had
          they of the loving-kindness of God towards them. As, however, there is
          no just cause to urge us to change the verb from the future into the
          past tense, it is quite in unison with the scope of the passage, if we
          say that the same blessing is here promised to the faithful which they
          have formerly realized. Thus the meaning will be, that God, mindful of
          his covenant, has hitherto been attentive to us; therefore, as he has
          begun to favor us, he will continue to do so for ever. In pronouncing
          these blessings, he observes the same order as above, assigning to the
          children of Aaron a superior place in God's benediction, excluding
          from it those among the Israelites who were hypocrites.

          He says, both the small with the great, by which circumstance he
          magnifies God's paternal regard the more, showing that he does not
          overlook even the meanest and most despised, provided they cordially
          invoke his aid. Now, as there is no acceptance of persons before God,
          our low and abject condition ought to be no obstruction to our drawing
          near to him, since he so kindly invites to approach him those who
          appear to be held in no reputation. Moreover, the repetition of the
          word bless is intended to mark the uninterrupted stream of his
          loving-kindness. Should any prefer the past tense, he has blessed, the
          meaning will be, that the favor of God towards his people has
          continued for a long period, which ought to be a sure evidence of the
          perpetuity of his fatherly regard. This interpretation is strengthened
          by the subsequent verse, in which he says, that God would multiply the
          benefits which he had up to that time conferred upon them. For God's
          liberality is an inexhaustible fountain, which will never cease to
          flow so long as its progress is not impeded by the ingratitude of men.
          And hence it will be continued to their posterity, because God
          manifests the grace and the fruit of his adoption even to a thousand
          generations.

          15. Ye are blessed of Jehovah In the preceding verse the prophet had
          given them the hope of uninterrupted happiness, arising from God's
          infinite resources never failing, however liberally and largely he
          bestows, and from his never ceasing to enrich those whom he hath
          admitted as sharers of his bounty. In confirmation of this doctrine,
          he declares that the children of Abraham were separated from other
          nations; so that, relying upon this privilege, they might
          unhesitatingly and unreservedly surrender themselves to a father so
          benignant and bountiful. And as the flesh, in consequence of its
          stupidity, cannot perceive the power of God, the understanding of
          which preserves us in a state of peace and security under his
          protection, the prophet, in designating him the maker of heaven and
          earth, reminds us that there is no ground to fear that he is unable to
          defend us; for, having created the heaven and the earth, he does not
          now remain unconcerned in heaven, but all creation is under his
          sovereign control.
