        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.845)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, December 13th, 1868, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle,</p>
        <p>
          |And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
          Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and
          be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and
          will multiply thee exceedingly.| -- Genesis 17:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE COMMENCED our exposition of the life of Abram with his calling,
          when he was brought out of Ur of the Chaldees, and separated unto the
          Lord in Canaan. We then passed on to his justification, when he
          believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; and now
          you will bear with us if we continue to the same subject to a further
          stage, and attempt to describe the fuller development of Abram's vital
          godliness in the open and clear revelation of his consecration to God.
          In the chapter before us we see his sanctification unto the Lord, his
          ordination to service, and purification as a vessel fitted for the
          Master's use. All the called are justified, and all the justified are
          by a work of the Holy Ghost sanctified, and made meet to be afterwards
          glorified with Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you of the order in which these blessings come. If we
          should speak of sanctification or consecration, it is not as a first
          thing, but as an elevation to be reached only by preceding
          stepping-stones. In vain do men pretend to be consecrated to God
          before they are called of God's Spirit; such have yet to be taught
          that no strength of nature can suffice to serve the Lord aright. They
          must learn what this meaneth, |Ye must be born again,| for assuredly
          until men are brought into spiritual life by effectual calling of the
          Holy Spirit, all their talk about serving God may be answered in the
          words of Joshua, |Ye cannot serve the Lord.| I speak of consecration,
          but it is not as a first thing, nor even as a second thing, for a man
          must be justified by faith which is in Christ Jesus, or he will not
          possess the grace which is the root of all true sanctity; for
          sanctification grows out of faith in Jesus Christ. Remember holiness
          is a flower, not a root; it is not sanctification that saves, but
          salvation that sanctifies. A man is not saved by his holiness, but he
          becomes holy because he is already saved. Being justified by faith,
          and having peace with God, he walks no longer after the flesh, but
          after the Spirit, and in the power of the blessing which he has
          received by grace he dedicates himself to the service of his gracious
          God. Not then the due order of heavenly benefits, consecration to God
          follows calling and justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling your minds to Abram's history, let me remind you that
          thirteen years had elapsed after the time in which God had said that
          Abram's faith was counted to him for righteousness, and those thirteen
          years, so far as we can gather from Scripture, were not at all so full
          of brave faith and noble deeds as we might have expected them to have
          been. How sure is that truth that the best of men are but men at the
          best, for that very man who had accepted God's promise and had not
          staggered at it through unbelief, within a few months afterwards, or
          perhaps a few days, was taken with a fit of unbelief, and at the
          instigation of his wife, adopted means which were not justifiable, in
          order that he might obtain the promised heir. He used means which may
          not be so vicious to him, as they would be in men of modern times, but
          which were suggested by an unbelieving policy, and were fraught with
          evil. He takes Hagar to wife. He could not leave it to God to give him
          the promised seed; he could not leave it with God to fulfil his
          promise in his own time, but justifies himself in turning aside from
          the narrow path of faith to accomplish by doubtful methods the end
          which God himself had promised and undertaken to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shorn of splendour is Abram seen when we read of him, |and Abram
          hearkened unto the voice of Sarai!| That business of Hagar is to the
          patriacrch's deep discredit, and reflects no honour at all upon either
          him or his faith. Look at the consequences of his unbelieving
          procedure! Misery soon followed. Hagar despises her mistress; Sarai
          throws all the blame on her husband; the poor bond-woman is so hardly
          dealt with that she flees from the household. How much of real cruelty
          may be meant by the term |dealing hardly,| I cannot tell, but one
          marvels that such a man as Abram allowed one who had been brought into
          such a relationship with him, to be heedlessly chased from his house
          while in a condition requiring care and kindness. We admire the
          truthfulness of the Holy Ghost that he has been pleased to record the
          faults of the saints without extenuating them. Biographies of good men
          in Scripture are written with unflinching integrity, their evil
          recorded as well as their good. These faults are not written that we
          may say, |Abraham did so-and-so, therefore we may do it.| No,
          brethren, the lives of these good men are warnings to us as well as
          examples, and we are to judge them as we should judge ourselves, by
          the laws of right and wrong. Abram did wrong both in taking Hagar to
          wife and in allowing her to be badly used.
        </p>
        <p>
          In after years the child of the bond-woman mocked the child of the
          free-woman, and an expulsion of both mother and child was needful.
          There was deep sorrow in Abram's heart, a bitterness not to be told.
          Polygamy, though tolerated under the Old Testament, was never
          approved; it was only endured because of the hardness of men's hearts.
          It is evil, only evil, and that continually. In the family
          relationship there can be opened no more abundant and fruitful source
          of misery to the sons of men than want of chastity to the
          marriage-bond made with one wife. Disguise that unchastity by what
          name you will. All these thirteen years, so far as Scripture informs
          us, Abram had not a single visit from his God. We do not find any
          record of his either doing anything memorable or having so much as a
          single audience with the Most High. Learn from this, that if we once
          forsake the track of simple faith, once cease to walk according to the
          purity which faith approves, we strew our path with thorns, cause God
          to withhold the light of his countenance from us, and pierce ourselves
          through with many sorrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mark, beloved, the exceeding grace of God. The way to recover
          Abram from his backsliding was that the Lord should appear to him;
          and, consequently, we read in our text that at ninety-nine years of
          age Abram was favoured with a further visit from the Most High. This
          brings to my remembrance the words in the book of Revelation,
          concerning the church in Laodicea: |Though art neither cold nor hot: I
          would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and
          neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth| -- a very
          solemn declaration; but what follows? |Behold, I stand at the door,
          and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in
          to him, and will sup with him, and he with me,| which means just this,
          that for recovery out of a horrible state of languishing and
          lukewarmness there is no remedy but the coming of Jesus Christ to the
          soul in near and dear intercourse. Truly it was so with Abram. The
          Lord would bring him out of his state of distrust and distance into
          one of high dignity and sanctity, and he does it by manifesting
          himself to him, for the Lord talked with Abram.
        </p>
        <p>|Midst darkest shades, if he appear,</p>
        <p>My dawning is begun;</p>
        <p>He is my soul's bright morning star,</p>
        <p>And he my rising sun.|</p>
        <p>
          Breathe a prayer, my brethren and sisters. |Lord, reveal thyself to my
          poor backsliding, languishing spirit. Revive me, O Lord, for one smile
          from thee can make my wilderness blossom as the rose.|
        </p>
        <p>
          On the occasion of this gracious manifestation, God was pleased to do
          for Abram what I think is to us an admirable and instructive
          illustration of the consecration of our redeemed spirits entirely to
          his service. I shall, this morning, as God may help me, first lead you
          to observe the model of the consecrated life; secondly, the nature of
          the higher life; and, thirdly, its results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let us notice in the words of God to Abram, THE MODEL
          OF THE SANCTIFIED OR CONSECRATED LIFE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is: |I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou
          perfect.| For a man to be thoroughly sanctified to the Master's
          service, he must first realise the almightiness and all-sufficiency
          and glory of God. Brethren, the God whom we serve filleth all things,
          and hath all power and all riches. If we think little of him we shall
          render little trust to him, and consequently little obedience, but if
          we have grand conceptions of the glory of God, we shall learn to
          confide in him most thoroughly, we shall receive mercies from him most
          plentifully, and we shall be moved to serve him most consistently. Sin
          at the bottom of it very frequently has its origin in low thoughts of
          God. Take Abram's sin; he could not see how God could make him the
          father of many nations when Sarai was old and barren. Hence his error
          with Hagar. But if he had remembered what God now brings to his
          recollection, that God is El Shaddai, the allsufficient One, he would
          have said, |No, I will remain true to Sarai, for God can effect his
          own purposes without my taking tortuous means to accomplish them. He
          is allsufficient in himself, and not dependent upon creature strength.
          I will patiently hope, and quietly wait, to see the fulfilment of the
          Master's promises.| Now, as with Abram, so with you, my brethren and
          sisters. When a man is in business difficulties, if he believes that
          God is allsufficient to carry him through them, he will not practise
          any of the common tricks of trade, nor degenerate into that shiftiness
          which is so usual among commercial men. If a man believes, being poor,
          that God is sufficient portion for him, he will not grow envious of
          the rich or discontented with his condition. The man who feels that
          God is an all-sufficient portion for his spirit, will not look for
          pleasure in the pursuits of vanity; he will not go with the giddy
          multitude after their vain mirth. |No,| saith he, |God hath appeared
          unto me as God all-sufficient for my comfort and my joy. I am content
          so long as God is mine. Let others drink of broken cisterns if they
          will, I dwell by the overflowing fountain, and am perfectly content.|
          O beloved, what glorious names our Lord deservedly wears! Whichever of
          his names you choose to dwell upon for a moment, what a mine of wealth
          and meaning it opens up to you! Here is this name, |El Shaddai;| |El,|
          that is, |the strong one,| for infinite power dwells in Jehovah. How
          readily may we who are weak become mighty if we draw upon him! And
          then, |Shaddai,| that is to say, |the unchangeable, the invincible.|
          What a God we have then, who knows no variableness, neither shadow of
          turning, against whom none can stand! |El,| strong; |Shaddai,|
          unchangeable in his strength; always therefore strong in every time of
          need, ready to defend his people, and able to preserve them from all
          their foes. Come, Christian, with such a God as this why needest thou
          abase thyself to win the good word of the wicked man? Why gaddest
          though abroad to find earthly pleasures where the roses are always
          mixed with thorns? Why needest thou to put thy confidence in gold and
          silver, or in the strength of thy body, or in aught that is beneath
          the moon? Thou hast El Shaddai to be thine. Thy power to be holy will
          much depend upon thy grasping with all the intensity of thy faith the
          cheering fact that this God is thy God for ever and ever, thy daily
          portion, thine all-sufficient consolation. Thou dares not, canst not,
          wilt not, wander into the ways of sin when thou knowest that such a
          God is thy shepherd and guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following up this model of the consecrated life, notice the next words
          -- |walk before me.| This is the style of life which characterises
          true holiness; it is a walking before God. Ah! Brethren, Abram had
          walked before Sarai; he had paid undue respect to her views and
          wishes; he had walked, too, in the sight of his own eyes and the
          inclinations of his own heart when he was allied to Hagar; but now the
          Lord gently rebukes him with the exhortation, |Walk before me.| It is
          remarkable that on the former divine visit to the patriarch (which we
          tried to interpret last Lord's-day), the Lord's message was |Fear
          not.| He was then, as it were, but a child in spiritual things, and
          the Lord gave him comfort, for he needed it. He is now grown into a
          man, and the exhortation is practical and full of activity -- |walk.|
          The Christian man is to put out and use the strength and grace which
          he hath received. The pith of the exhortation lies in the last words,
          |Walk before me,| by which I understand an habitual sense of the
          presence of God, or doing the right thing and shunning the wrong, out
          of respect to the will of God; a consideration of God in all actions,
          public and private. Brethren, I deeply regret when I see Christian
          men, even in religious societies, in their calculations leaving out
          the greatest item in the whole calculation -- namely, the divine
          element, the divine power and faithfulness. Of the most of mankind I
          may say, without being censorious, that if there were no God their
          course of action would not be different from what it is, for they do
          not feel themselves either restrained or constrained by any sense of
          the divine presence. |The transgression of the wicked saith within my
          heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.| But this is the
          mark of the truly sanctified man of God, that he lives in every place
          as standing in the presence chamber of the divine Majesty; he acts as
          knowing that the eye which never sleeps is always fixed on him. His
          heart's desire is that he may never do the wrong thing, because he has
          respect to worldly greatness, and may never forget the right thing
          because he is in evil company, but may reckon that God being
          everywhere, he is always in company where it would be impudent
          rebellion to sin. The saint feels that he must not, dare not,
          transgress, because he is before the very face of God. This is the
          model of the sanctified character, for a man to realise what the Lord
          is, and then to act as in the immediate presence of a holy and jealous
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next words are, |and be thou perfect.| Brethren, does this mean
          absolute perfection? I shall not controvert the belief of some, that
          we may be absolutely perfect on earth. Freely do I admit that the
          model of sanctification is perfection. It were inconsistent with the
          character of God for him to give us any other than a perfect command,
          and a perfect standard. No law but that of absolute perfection could
          come from a perfect God, and to give us a model that were not
          absolutely perfect, were to ensure to us superabundant imperfections,
          and to give us an excuse for them. God sets before his servants no
          rule of this kind, |Be as good as you can,| but this, |Be you perfect,
          even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.| Hath any man ever
          attained to it? Truly we have not, but for all that, every Christian
          man aims at it. I would far rather my child had a perfect copy to
          write by, though he might never write equal to it, than that he should
          have an imperfect copy set before him, because then he would never
          make a good writer at all. Our heavenly Father has given us the
          perfect image of Christ to be our example, his perfect law to be our
          rule, and it is for us to aim at this perfection in the power of the
          Holy Spirit, and, like Abram, to fall upon our faces in shame and
          confusion of face, when we recollect how far we have come short of it.
          Perfection is what we wish for, pant after, and shall at the last
          obtain. We do not want to have the law toned down to our weakness.
          Blessed be God, we delight in the perfection of that law. We say with
          Paul, |The law is holy, and just, and good, but I am carnal, sold
          under sin.| The will of God is that which we would be conformed unto;
          and if we who are believers had but one wish, and it could be granted
          to us at once, it should be this, to make us perfect in every good
          work to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his
          sight. However, the word |perfect,| as I have said, bears commonly the
          meaning of |upright,| or |sincere| -- |walk before me, and be thou
          sincere.| No double dealing must the Christian man have, no playing
          fast and loose with God or man; no hypocritical professions, or false
          principles. He must be as transparent as glass; he must be a man in
          whom there is no guile, a man who has cast aside deceit in every
          shape, who hates it, and loathes it, and walks before God, who sees
          all things with absolute sincerity, earnestly desiring in all things,
          both great and small, to commend himself to the conscience of others
          as in the sight of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, here is the model of the consecrated life. Do you not long
          to attain to it? I am sure every soul that is moved by God's grace
          will do so. But if your feeling about it is like mine, it will be just
          that of Abram in the text, |Abram fell on his face before the Lord.|
          For oh, how far short we have come of this! We have not always thought
          of God as all-sufficient; we have been unbelieving. We have doubted
          him here, and doubted him there. We have not gone to work in this
          world as if we believed the promise, |I will never leave thee, nor
          forsake thee.| We have not been satisfied to suffer, or to be poor,
          and we have not been content to do his will without asking questions.
          We might often have had addressed to us the rebuke, |Is the Lord's
          hand waxed short? Is his arm shortened at all? Is his ear heavy, that
          he cannot hear?| Brethren, we have not always walked before the Lord.
          If one may speak for the rest, we do not always feel the presence of
          God as a check to us. There are angry words perhaps at the table;
          there is wrong-doing in the place of business; there are carelessness,
          worldliness, pride, and I know not what beside of evil to mar the
          day's labour; and when we come back at night we have to confess, |I
          have gone astray like a lost sheep, I have forgotten my Shepherd's
          presence. I have not always spoken and acted as if I felt that thou
          wast always looking upon me.| Thus it has come to pass that we have
          not been perfect. I feel ready to laugh, not the laugh of Abram, but
          that of thorough ridicule, when I hear people talk about their being
          absolutely perfect. They must be of very different flesh and blood
          from us, or rather they must be great fools, full of conceit, and
          utterly ignorant of themselves; for if they did but look at a single
          action, they would find specks in it; and if they examined but one
          single day, they would perceive something in which they fell short, if
          there were nothing in which they had transgressed. You see your model,
          brethren, study it in the life of Christ, and then press forward to it
          with the zeal of the apostle who said, |Not as though I had already
          attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I
          may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
          Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I
          do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
          those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize
          of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, THE NATURE OF THIS CONSECRATION as illustrated in this
          chapter. On each point briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Genuine spiritual consecration begins with communion with God. Note
          the third verse: -- |Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him.|
          By looking at Christ Jesus, his image is photographed upon our mind,
          and we are changed from glory to glory, as by the presence of the
          Lord. Distance from God's presence always means sin: holy familiarity
          with God engenders holiness. The more you think of God, the more you
          meditate upon his works, the more you praise him, the more you pray to
          him, the more constantly you talk with him, and he with you, by the
          Holy Ghost, the more surely are you upon the road to thorough
          consecration to his cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next point in the nature of this consecration is that it is
          fostered by enlarged views of the covenant of grace. Read on: |As for
          me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of
          many nations.| This is said to help Abram to walk before God and to be
          perfect; from which we conclude that to grow in sanctification a man
          should increase in knowledge, and also in the tenacity of the faith
          which grasps the covenant which God has made with Christ for his
          people, which is |Ordered in all things and sure.| With your Bibles
          open, notice attentively that Abram was refreshed as to his own
          personal interest in the covenant. Note the second personal pronoun,
          how it is repeated: |As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and
          thou shalt be a father of many nations.| Take the sixth verse, |I will
          make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and
          kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between
          me and thee, and thy seed after thee . . . .to be a God unto thee, and
          to thy seed after thee.| Thus Abram has the covenant brought home to
          himself; he is made to feel that he has a part and a lot therein. If
          you are ever to be sanctified unto God's service, you must get a full
          assurance of your interest in all the convenant provisions. Doubts are
          like wild boars of the wood, which tear up the flowers of
          sanctification in the garden of the heart; but when you have in your
          soul a God-given assurance of your interest in the precious blood of
          Jesus Christ, then shall the foxes which spoil the vines be hunted to
          death, and your tender grapes shall give a good smell. Cry to God,
          beloved brethren and sisters, for strong faith to |Read your title
          clear to mansions in the skies.| Great holiness must spring from great
          faith. Faith is the root, obedience the branch; and if the root decays
          the branch cannot flourish. Ask to know that Christ is yours, and that
          you are his; for here you will find a fountain to water your
          consecration and make it yield fruit to Christ's service. Some
          professors act as if this were not the case. They foment their doubts
          and fears in order to perfect holiness. I have known Christians, when
          they are conscious that they have not lived as they ought to live,
          begin to doubt their interest in Christ, and, as they say, humble
          themselves in order to reach after fuller sanctification of life. That
          is to say, they starve themselves in order to grow strong; they throw
          their gold out of window in order to become rich; they pull up the
          very foundation-stone of their house to make it stand secure. Beloved
          believer, sinner as thou art, backslider as thou art, still believe in
          Jesus, let not a sense of sin weaken thy faith in him. He died for
          sinners, |in due time Christ died for the ungodly.| Cling to that
          cross still: the more furious the storm the more need of the life-buoy
          -- never leave it, but make your hold the firmer. Confide alone in the
          virtue of that precious blood, for thus only will you slay your sins
          and advance in holiness. If you say within your heart, |Jesus cannot
          save such a one as I am; if I had marks and evidences of being God's
          child, I could then trust in compense of reward; you have cast away
          your shield, and the darts of the tempter will wound you terribly.
          Cling to Jesus even when it is a question whether you have a grain of
          grace in your hearts. Believe that he died for you, not because you
          are consecrated or sanctified, but died for you as sinners, and saves
          you as sinners. Never lose your simple trust in the Crucified, for
          only by the blood of the Lamb can you overcome sin and be made fit for
          the Lord's work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, in reading these words, how this covenant is revealed to Abram
          peculiarly as a work of divine power. Note the run of the passage, |I
          will make my covenant between me and thee.| |I will make thee
          fruitful.| |I will establish my covenant.| |I will give unto thee.| |I
          will be thy God,| and so on. Oh! those glorious |wills| and |shalls.|
          Brethren, ye cannot serve the Lord with a perfect heart until first
          your faith gets a grip of the divine |will| and |shall.| If my
          salvation rests upon this poor, puny arm, upon my resolves, my
          integrity, and my faithfulness, it is shipwrecked for ever; but if my
          eternal salvation rests upon the great arm which bears up the
          universe, if my soul's safety is altogether in that hand that wheels
          the stars along, then blessed be his name, it is safe and well; and
          now out of love to such a Saviour I will serve him with all my heart.
          I will spend and be spent for him who has thus graciously undertaken
          for me. Mark this, brethren, be very clear about it, and ask to have
          the divine working made apparent to your soul, for that will help you
          to be consecrated to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, Abraham had a view of the covenant in its everlastingness. I
          do not remember that the word |everlasting| had been used before in
          reference to that covenant, but in this chapter we have it over and
          over again. |I will establish my covenant for an everlasting
          covenant.| Here is one of those grand truths which many of the babes
          in grace have not as yet learned, namely, that the blessings of grace
          are blessings not given to-day to be taken back to-morrow, but eternal
          blessings. The salvation which is in Christ Jesus is not a salvation
          which will belong to us for a few hours, while we are faithful to it,
          and will then be taken away, so that we shall be left to perish. God
          forbid, |He is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that
          he should repent.| |I am God,| saith he, |I change not: therefore, ye
          sons of Jacob are not consumed.| When we put ourselves into the hands
          of Christ, we do not confide in a Saviour who might suffer us to be
          destroyed, but we rest in one who hath said, |I give unto my sheep
          eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck
          them out of my hand.| Instead of the doctrine of the security of the
          saints leading to negligence of life, you will find that, on the
          contrary, where it is thoroughly well received in the heart by the
          power of the Holy Ghost, it begets such a holy confidence in God, such
          a flaming gratitude to him, that it is one of the best incentives to
          consecration. Treasure up these thoughts, dear brethren, and if you
          would grow in grace and in conformity to Christ, endeavour to perceive
          your personal interest in the covenant, the divine power which
          guarantees its fulfilment, and the everlastingness of its character.
        </p>
        <p>
          In considering the nature of this consecration, I would observe next,
          that they who are consecrated to God are regarded as new men. The new
          manhood is indicated by the change of name -- he is called no longer
          Abram, but Abraham, and his wife is no longer Sarai, but Sarah. Ye,
          beloved, are new creatures in Christ Jesus. The root and source of all
          consecration to God lies in regeneration. We are |born again,| a new
          and incorruptible seed is placed within us which |liveth and abideth
          for ever.| The name of Christ is named upon us: we are no longer
          called sinners and unjust, but we become the children of God by faith
          which is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note further that the nature of this consecration was set forth to
          Abraham by the rite of circumcision. It would not be at all fitting or
          decorous for us to enter into any detail as to that mysterious rite,
          but it will suffice to say that the rite of circumcision signified the
          taking away of the filthiness of the flesh. We have the apostle Paul's
          own interpretation of circumcision in the verses which we read just
          now in his epistle to the Colossians. Circumcision indicated to the
          seed of Abraham that there was a defilement of the flesh in man which
          must for ever be taken away, or man would remain impure, and out of
          covenant with God. Now, beloved, there must be, in order to our
          sanctification to Christ, a giving up, a painful relinquishing of
          things as dear to us as right eyes and right hands. There must be a
          denying of the flesh with its affections and lusts. We must mortify
          our members. There must be self-denial if we are to enter upon the
          service of God. The Holy Spirit must pass sentence of death and
          cutting away upon the passions and tendencies of corrupt humanity.
          Much must perish which nature would cherish, but die it must, because
          grace abhors it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, with regard to circumcision, that it was peremptorily ordained
          that it should be practised on every male of the race of Abraham, and
          if it were neglected, death followed. So the giving up of sin, the
          giving up of the body of the filth of the flesh is necessary to every
          believer. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Even the babe in
          Christ is as much to see death written upon the body of the filth of
          the flesh as a man who, like Abraham, has reached advanced years and
          come to maturity in spiritual things. There is not distinction here
          between the one and the other. |Without holiness no man shall see the
          Lord;| and where a supposed grace does not take away from us a love of
          sin, it is not the grace of God at all, but the presumptuous conceit
          of our own vain natures.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often said that the ordinance of baptism is analagous to the
          ordinance of circumcision. I will not controvert that point, although
          the statement may be questioned. But supposing it to be, let me urge
          upon every believer here to see to it that in his own soul he realises
          the spiritual meaning both of circumcision and baptism, and then
          consider the outward rites; for the thing signified is vastly more
          important than the sign. Baptism sets forth far more than
          circumcision. Circumcision is putting away of the filth of the flesh,
          but baptism is the burial of the flesh altogether. Baptism does not
          say, |Here is something to be taken away,| but everything is dead, and
          must be buried with Christ in his tomb, and the man must rise anew
          with Christ. Baptism teaches us that by death we pass into the new
          life. As Noah's ark, passing through the death of the old world,
          emerged into a new world, even so, by a like figure, baptism sets
          forth our salvation by the resurrection of Christ: a baptism of which
          Peter says, it is |not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
          the answer of a good conscience toward God.| In baptism, the man avows
          to himself and others that he comes by death into newness of life,
          according to the words of the Holy Spirit, |Buried with him in
          baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the
          operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.| The most
          valuable point is the spiritual meaning, and on that we experience
          what it is to be dead to the world, to be dead and buried with Christ,
          and then to be risen with him. Still, brethren, Abraham was not
          allowed to say, |If I get the spiritual meaning, I can do without the
          outward rite.| He might have objected to that rite on a thousand
          grounds a great deal more strong than any which the hesitating have
          urged against baptism, but he first accepted the rite, as well as the
          thing which it intended, and straightway was circumcised; and so I
          exhort you, men and brethren, to be obedient to the precept upon
          baptism, as well as attentive to the truth which it signifies. If you
          be indeed buried with Christ, and risen with him, despise not the
          outward and instructive sign by which this is set forth. |Well,| saith
          one, |a difficulty suggests itself as to your views,| for an argument
          is often drawn from this chapter, |that inasmuch as Abraham must
          circumcise all his seed, we ought to baptise all our children.| Now,
          observe the type and interpret it not according to prejudice, but
          according to Scripture. In the type the seed of Abraham are
          circumcised; you draw the inference that all typified by the seed of
          Abraham ought to be baptised, and I do not cavil at the conclusion;
          but I ask you, who are the true seed of Abraham? Paul answers in
          Romans ix.8, |They which are the children of the flesh, these are not
          the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for
          the seed.| As many as believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, whether they
          be Jews or Gentiles, are Abraham's seed. Whether eight days old in
          grace, or more or less, every one of Abraham's seed has a right to
          baptism. But I deny that the unregenerate, whether children or adults,
          are of the spiritual seed of Abraham. The Lord will, we trust, call
          many of them by his grace, but as yet they are |heirs of wrath, even
          as others.| At such time as the Spirit of God shall sow the good seed
          in their hearts, they are of Abraham's believing seed, but they are
          not so while they live in ungodliness and unbelief, or are as yet
          incapable of faith or repentance. The answering person in type to the
          seed of Abraham is, by the confession of everybody, the believer; and
          the believer ought, seeing he is buried with Christ spiritually, to
          avow that fact, by his public baptism in water, according to the
          Saviour's own precept and example. |Thus,| said Christ, |it becometh
          us to fulfil all righteousness,| as he went down to the river Jordan.
          At the Jordan was he sprinkled? Why go down to a river to be
          sprinkled? Why went he down into the water to be sprinkled? |Us.| Did
          he mean babes? Was he a babe? Was not he, when he said |us,| speaking
          of the faithful who are in him? |And thus it becometh us to fulfil all
          righteousness,| that is, all his saints. But how does baptism fulfil
          all righteousness? Typically thus: -- It is the picture of the whole
          work of Christ. There is his immersion in suffering; his death and
          burial; his coming up out of the water represents his resurrection;
          his coming up the banks of Jordan represents his ascension. It is a
          typical representation of how he fulfilled all righteousness, and how
          the saints fulfilled it in him. But, brethren, I did not intend to go
          so far into the outward sign, because my soul's deepest desire is
          this, that like as Abraham by the outward sign was taught that there
          was a putting away of the filth of flesh, which must be, or death must
          follow, so are we taught by baptism that there is an actual death to
          the world, and a resurrection with Christ, which must be to every
          believer, however old or however young, or he hath not part or lot in
          the matter of consecration to God, or, indeed, in salvation itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have a third head, but my time is gone, and, therefore, just
          these hints. THE RESULTS OF SUCH A CONSECRATION.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately after God's appearing to Abraham, his consecration was
          manifest, first, in his prayer for his family. |O that Ishmael might
          live before thee!| Men of God, if you are indeed the Lord's, and feel
          that you are his, begin now to intercede for all who belong to you.
          Never be satisfied unless they are saved too; and if you have a son,
          an Ishmael, concerning whom you have many fears and much anxiety, as
          you are saved yourself, never cease to groan out that cry, |O that
          Ishmael might live before thee!|
        </p>
        <p>
          The next result of Abraham's consecration was, that he was most
          hospitable to his fellow men. Look at the next chapter. He sits at the
          tent door, and three men come to him. The Christian is the best
          servant of humanity in a spiritual sense. I mean that for his Master's
          sake he endeavours to do good to the sons of men. He is of all men the
          first to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked, and as much as lieth
          in him to do good unto all men, especially unto such as be of the
          household of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third result was, Abraham entertained the Lord himself, for
          amongst those three angels who came to his house was the King of
          kings, the infinite One. Every believer who serves his God doth, as it
          were, give refreshment to the divine mind. I mean this, God took an
          infinite delight in the work of his dear Son. He said, |This is my
          beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,| and he takes a delight also
          in the holiness of all his people. Jesus sees of the travail of his
          soul, and is satisfied by the works of the faithful,; and you,
          brethren, as Abraham entertained the Lord, do entertain the Lord Jesus
          with your patience and your faith, with your love and your zeal, when
          you are thoroughly consecrated to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, Abraham became the great intercessor for others. The next
          chapter is full of his pleadings for Sodom. He had not been able to
          plead before, but after circumcision, after consecration, he becomes
          the King's remembrancer, he is installed into the office of a priest,
          and he stands there crying, |Wilt thou not save the city? Wilt thou
          destroy the righteous with the wicked?| O beloved, if we do but become
          consecrated to God, thoroughly so, as I have attempted feebly to
          describe, we shall become mighty with God in our pleadings. I believe
          one holy man is a greater blessing to a nation than a whole regiment
          of soldiers. Did not they fear more the prayers of John Knox than the
          arms of ten thousand men? A man who lives habitually near to God is
          like a great cloud for ever dropping with fertilising showers. This is
          the man who can say, |The earth is dissolved, I bear up the pillars
          thereof.| France had never seen so bloody a revolution had there been
          men of prayer to preserve her. England, amidst the commotions which
          make her rock to and fro, is held fast because prayer is put up
          incessantly by the faithful. The flag of old England is nailed to her
          mast, not by the hands of her sailors, but by the prayers of the
          people of God. These, as they intercede day and night, and as they go
          about their spiritual ministry, these are they for whom God spareth
          nations, for whom he permitteth the earth still to exist; and when
          their time is over, and they are taken away, the salt being taken from
          the earth, then shall the elements dissolve with fervent heat, the
          earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up; but not
          until he hath caught away the saints with Christ into the air shall
          this world pass away. He will spare it for the righteous' sake. Seek
          after the highest degree of sanctity, my dear brethren and sisters,
          seek for it, labour for it; and while you rest in faith alone for
          justification, be not slack concerning growth in grace, that the
          highest attainments be your ambition, and God grant them to you, for
          his Son's sake. Amen.
