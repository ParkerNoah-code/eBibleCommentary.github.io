        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.291)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 25th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand</p>
        <p>
          |For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.| -- Isaiah 9:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          UPON OTHER OCCASIONS I have explained the main part of this verse --
          |the government shall be upon his shoulders, his name shall be called
          Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God.| If God shall spare me, on some
          future occasion I hope to take the other titles, |The Everlasting
          Father, the Prince of Peace.| But now this morning the portion which
          will engage our attention is this, |Unto us a child is born, unto us a
          Son is given.| The sentence is a double one, but it has in it no
          tautology. The careful reader will soon discover a distinction; and it
          is not a distinction without a difference. |Unto us a child is born,
          unto us a Son is given.| As Jesus Christ is a child in his human
          nature, he is born, begotten of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin
          Mary. He is as truly-born, as certainly a child, as any other man that
          ever lived upon the face of the earth. He is thus in his humanity a
          child born. But as Jesus Christ is God's Son, he is not born; but
          given, begotten of his Father from before all worlds, begotten -- not
          made, being of the same substance with the Father. The doctrine of the
          eternal affiliation of Christ is to be received as an undoubted truth
          of our holy religion. But as to any explanation of it, no man should
          venture thereon, for it remaineth among the deep things of God -- one
          of those solemn mysteries indeed, into which the angels dare not look,
          nor do they desire to pry into it -- a mystery which we must not
          attempt to fathom, for it is utterly beyond the grasp of any finite
          being. As well might a gnat seek to drink in the ocean, as a finite
          creature to comprehend the Eternal God. A God whom we could understand
          would be no God. If we could grasp him he could not be infinite: if we
          could understand him, then were he not divine. Jesus Christ then, I
          say, as a Son, is not born to us, but given. He is a boon bestowed on
          us, |For God so loved the world, that he sent his only begotten Son
          into the world.| He was not born in this world as God's Son, but he
          was sent, or was given, so that you clearly perceive that the
          distinction is a suggestive one, and conveys much good truth to us.
          |Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning, however, the principal object of my discourse, and,
          indeed, the sole one, is to bring out the force of those two little
          words, |unto us.| For you will perceive that here the full force of
          the passage lies. |For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
          given.| The divisions of my discourse are very simple ones. First, is
          it so? Secondly, if it is so, what then? Thirdly, if it is not so,
          what then?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, IS IT SO? Is it true that unto us a child is
          born, unto us a Son is given? It is a fact that a child is born. Upon
          that I use no argument. We receive it as a fact, more fully
          established than any other fact in history, that the Son of God became
          man, was born at Bethlehem, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in
          a manger. It is a fact, too, that a Son is given. About that we have
          no question. The infidel may dispute, but we, professing to be
          believers in Scripture, receive it as an undeniable truth, that God
          has given his only begotten Son to be the Savior of men. But the
          matter of question is this: Is this child born to us? Is he given to
          us? This is the matter of anxious enquiry. Have we a personal interest
          in the child that was born at Bethlehem? Do we know that he is our
          Savior? -- that he has brought glad tidings to us? -- that to us he
          belongs? and that we belong to him? I say this is matter of very grave
          and solemn investigation. It is a very observable fact, that the very
          best of men are sometimes troubled with questions with regard to their
          own interest in Christ, while men who never are troubled at all about
          the matter are very frequently presumptuous deceivers, who have no
          part in this matter. I have often observed that some of the people
          about whom I felt most sure, were the very persons who were the least
          sure of themselves. It reminds me of the history of a godly man named
          Simon Brown, a minister in the olden times in the City of London. He
          became so extremely sad in heart, so depressed in spirit, that at last
          he conceived the idea that his soul was annihilated. It was all in
          vain to talk to the good man, you could not persuade him that he had a
          soul; but all the time he was preaching, and praying, and working,
          more like a man that had two souls than none. When he preached, his
          eyes poured forth plenteous floods of tears, and when he prayed, there
          was a divine fervor and heavenly prevalence in every petition. Now so
          it is with many Christians. They seem to be the very picture of
          godliness; their life is admirable, and their conversation heavenly,
          but yet they are always crying, --
        </p>
        <p>|Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought,</p>
        <p>Do I love the Lord or no?</p>
        <p>Am I his or am I not?</p>
        <p>
          So does it happen, that the best of men will question while the worst
          of men will presume. Ay, I have seen the men about whose eternal
          destiny I had serious questioning, whose inconsistencies in life were
          palpable and glaring, who have prated concerning their sure portion in
          Israel, and their infallible hope, as though they believed others to
          be as easily duped as themselves. Now, what reason shall we give for
          this foolhardiness? Learn it from this illustration: You see a number
          of men riding along a narrow road upon the edge of the sea. It is a
          very perilous path, for the way is rugged and a tremendous precipice
          bounds the pathway on the left. Let but the horse's foot slip once,
          and they dash downwards to destruction. See how cautiously the riders
          journey, how carefully the horses place their feet. But do you observe
          yon rider, at what a rate he dashes along, as if he were riding a
          steeple-chase with Satan? You hold up your hands in an agony of fear,
          trembling lest every moment his horse's foot should slip, and he
          should be dashed down; and you say, why so careless a rider? The man
          is a blind rider on a blind horse. They cannot see where they are. He
          thinks he is on a sure road, and therefore it is that he rides so
          fast. Or to vary the picture; sometimes when persons are asleep, they
          take to walking and they will climb where others will not think of
          venturing. Giddy heights that would turn our brain seem safe enough to
          them. So there be many spiritual sleep-walkers in our midst, who think
          that they are awake. But they are not. Their very presumption in
          venturing to the high places of self-confidence, proves that they are
          somnambulists; not awake, but men who walk and talk in their sleep. It
          is, then, I say, really a matter of serious questioning with all men
          who would be right at last, as to whether this child is born to us,
          and this Son given to us?
        </p>
        <p>I shall now help you to answer the question.</p>
        <p>
          1. If this child who now lies before the eyes of your faith, wrapped
          in swaddling clothes in Bethlehem's manger, is born to you, my hearer,
          then you are born again! For this child is not born to you unless you
          are born to this child. All who have an interest in Christ are, in the
          fullness of time, by grace converted, quickened, and renewed. All the
          redeemed are not yet converted, but they will be. Before the hour of
          death arrives their nature shall be changed, their sins shall be
          washed away, they shall pass from death unto life. If any man tells me
          that Christ is his Redeemer, although he has never experienced
          regeneration, that man utters what he does not know; his religion is
          vain, and his hope is a delusion. Only men who are born again can
          claim the babe in Bethlehem as being theirs. |But| saith one, |how am
          I to know whether I am born again or not?| Answer this question also
          by another: Has there been a change effected by divine grace within
          you? Are your loves the very opposite of what they were? Do you now
          hate the vain things you once admired, and do you seek after that
          precious pearl which you at one time despised? Is your heart
          thoroughly renewed in its object? Can you say that the bent of your
          desire is changed? that your face is Zionward, and your feet set upon
          the path of grace? that whereas your heart once longed for deep
          draughts of sin, it now longs to be holy? and whereas you once loved
          the pleasures of the world, they have now become as draff and dross to
          you, for you only love the pleasures of heavenly things, and are
          longing to enjoy more of them on earth, that you may be prepared to
          enjoy a fullness of them hereafter? Are you renewed within? For mark,
          my hearer, the new birth does not consist in washing the outside of
          the cup and platter, but in cleansing the inner man. It is all in vain
          to put up the stone upon the sepulcher, wash it extremely white, and
          garnish it with the flowers of the season; the sepulcher itself must
          be cleansed. The dead man's bones that lie in that charnel-house of
          the human heart must be cleansed away. Nay, they must be made to live.
          The heart must no longer be a tomb of death, but a temple of life. Is
          it so with you, my hearer? For recollect, you may be very different in
          the outward, but if you are not changed in the inward, this child is
          not born to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I put another question. Although the main matter of regeneration
          lies within, yet it manifests itself without. Say, then, has there
          been a change in you in the exterior? Do you think that others who
          look at you would be compelled to say, this man is not what he used to
          be? Do not your companions observe a change? Have they not laughed at
          you for what they think to be your hypocrisy, your puritanism, your
          sternness? Do you think now that if an angel should follow you into
          your secret life, should track you to your closet and see you on your
          knees, that he would detect something in you which he could never have
          seen before? For, mark, my dear hearer, there must be a change in the
          outward life, or else there is no change within. In vain you bring me
          to the tree, and say that the tree's nature is changed. If I still see
          it bringing forth wild grapes, it is a wild vine still. And if I mark
          upon you the apples of Sodom and the grapes of Gomorrah you are still
          a tree accursed and doomed, notwithstanding all your fancied
          experience. The proof of the Christian is in the living. To other men,
          the proof of our conversion is not what you feel, but what you do. To
          yourself your feelings may be good enough evidence, but to the
          minister and others who judge of you, the outward walk is the main
          guide. At the same time, let me observe that a man's outward life may
          be very much like that of a Christian, and yet there may be no
          religion in him at all. Have you ever seen two jugglers in the street
          with swords, pretending to fight with one another? See how they cut,
          and slash, and hack at one another, till you are half afraid there
          will soon be murder done. They seem to be so very much in earnest that
          you are half in the mind to call in the police to part them. See with
          what violence that one has aimed a terrific blow at the other one's
          head, which his comrade dexterously warded off by keeping a well-timed
          guard. Just watch them a minute, and you will see that all these cuts
          and thrusts come in a prearranged order. There is no heart in the
          fighting after all. They do not fight so roughly as they would if they
          were real enemies. So, sometimes I have seen a man pretending to be
          very angry against sin. But watch him a little while, and you will see
          it is only a fencer's trick. He does not give his cuts out of order,
          there is no earnestness in his blows, it is all pretense, it is only
          mimic stage-play. The fencers, after they have ended their
          performance, shake hands with one another, and divide the coppers
          which the gaping throng have given them; and so does this man do, he
          shakes hands with the devil in private, and the two deceivers share
          the spoil. The hypocrite and the devil are very good friends after
          all, and they mutually rejoice over their profits: the devil leering
          because he has won the soul of the professor, and the hypocrite
          laughing because he has won his pelf. Take care, then, that your
          outward life is not a mere stage-play, but that your antagonism to sin
          is real and intense; and that you strike right and left, as though you
          meant to slay the monster, and cast its limbs to the winds of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will just put another question. If thou hast been born again, there
          is another matter by which to try thee. Not only is thy inward self
          altered, and thy outward self too, but the very root and principle of
          thy life must become totally new. When we are in sin we live to self,
          but when we are renewed we live to God. While we are unregenerate, our
          principle is to seek our own pleasure, our own advancement; but that
          man is not truly born again who does not live with a far different aim
          from this. Change a man's principles, and you change his feelings, you
          change his actions. Now, grace changes the principles of man. It lays
          the axe at the root of the tree. It does not saw away at some big limb
          it does not try to alter the sap; but it gives a new root, and plants
          us in fresh sold. The man's inmost self, the deep rocks of his
          principles upon which the topsoil of his actions rest, the soul of his
          manhood is thoroughly changed, and he is a new creature in Christ.
          |But,| says one, |I see no reason why I should be born again.| Ah,
          poor creature, it is because thou hast never seen thyself. Didst thou
          ever see a man in the looking-glass of the Word of God -- what a
          strange monster he is. Do you know, a man by nature has his heart
          where his feet ought to be: -- that is to say, his heart is set upon
          the earth, whereas he ought to be treading it beneath his feet; and
          stranger mystery still, his heels are where his heart should be: --
          that is to say, he is kicking against the God of heaven when he ought
          to be setting his affections on things above. Man by nature when he
          sees clearest, only looks down, can only see that which is beneath
          him, he cannot see the things which are above; and strange to say the
          sunlight of heaven blinds him; light from heaven he looks not for. He
          asks for his light in darkness. The earth is to him his heaven, and he
          sees suns in its muddy pools and stars in its filth. He is, in fact, a
          man turned upside down. The fall has so ruined our nature, that the
          most monstrous thing on the face of the earth is a fallen man. The
          ancients used to paint griffins, gryphons, dragons, chimeras, and all
          kinds of hideous things; but if a skillful hand could paint man
          accurately none of us would look at the picture, for it is a sight
          that none ever saw except the lost in hell; and that is one part of
          their intolerable pain, that they are compelled always to look upon
          themselves Now, then, see you not that ye must be born again, and
          unless ye are so this child is not born to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But I go forward. If this child is born to you, you are a child,
          and the question arises, are you so? Man grows from childhood up to
          manhood naturally; in grace men grow from manhood down to childhood;
          and the nearer we come to true childhood, the nearer welcome to the
          image of Christ. For was not Christ called |a child,| even after he
          had ascended up to heaven? |Thy holy child Jesus.| Brethren and
          sisters, can you say that you have been made into children? Do you
          take God's Word just as it stands, simply because your heavenly Father
          says so? Are you content to believe mysteries without demanding to
          have them explained? Are you ready to sit in the infant class, and be
          a little one? Are you willing to hang upon the breast of the church,
          and suck in the unadulterated milk of the Word -- never questioning
          for a moment what your divine Lord reveals, but believing it on his
          own authority, whether it seemed to be above reason, or beneath
          reason, or even contrary to reason? Now, |except ye be converted and
          become as little children,| this child is not born to you; except like
          a child you are humble, teachable, obedient, pleased with your
          Father's will and willing to assign all to him, there is grave matter
          of question whether this child is born to you. But what a pleasing
          sight it is to see a man converted and made into a little child. Many
          times has my heart leaped for joy, when I have seen a giant infidel
          who used to reason against Christ, who had not a word in his
          dictionary bad enough for Christ's people come by divine grace to
          believe the gospel. That man sits down and weeps, feels the full power
          of salvation and from that time drops all his questionings becomes the
          very reverse of what he was. He thinks himself meaner than the meanest
          believer. He is content to do the meanest work for the church of
          Christ, and takes his station -- not with Locke or Newton, as a mighty
          Christian philosopher -- but with Mary as a simple learner, sitting at
          Jesus' feet, to hear and learn of him. If ye are not children, then
          this child is not born to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And now let us take the second sentence and put a question or two
          upon that. Is this son given to us? I pause a minute to beg your
          personal attention. I am trying, if I may, so to preach that I may
          make you all question yourselves. I pray you let not one of you exempt
          himself from the ordeal but let each one ask himself, if it true that
          unto me a Son is given? Now, if this Son is given to you, you are a
          son yourself. |For unto as many as received him to them gave he power
          to become the sons of God.| |Christ became a Son that in all things he
          might be made like unto his brethren.| The Son of God is not mine to
          enjoy, to love, to delight in, unless I am a son of God too. Now, my
          hearer, have you a fear of God before your eyes -- a filial fear, a
          fear which a child has lest it should grieve its parent? Say have you
          a child's love to God? Do you trust to him as your father, your
          provider, and your friend? Have you in your breast |The spirit of
          adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father?| Are there times with you when
          on your knees you can say, |My Father and my God.| Does the Spirit
          bear witness with your spirit that you are born of God? and while this
          witness is born, does your heart fly up to your Father and to your
          God, in ecstacy of delight to clasp him who long ago hath clasped you
          in the covenant of his love, in the arms of his effectual grace? Now,
          mark my hearer, if thou dost not sometimes enjoy the spirit of
          adoption, if thou art not a son or daughter of Zion, then deceive not
          thyself, this Son is not given to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And, then, to put it in another shape. If unto us a Son is given,
          then we are given to the Son. Now, what say you to this question also?
          Are you given up to Christ? Do you feel that you have nothing on earth
          to live for but to glorify him? Can you say in your heart, |Great God,
          if I be not deceived I am wholly thine?| Are you ready to-day to write
          over again your consecration vow? Canst thou say, |Take me! All that I
          am and all I have, shall be for ever thine. I would give up all my
          goods, all my powers, all my time, and all my hours, and thine I would
          be -- wholly thine.| |Ye are not your own: ye are bought with a
          price.| And if this Son of God be given to you, you will have
          consecrated yourself wholly to him; and you will feel that his honor
          is your life's object, that his glory is the one great desire of your
          panting spirit. Now is it so, my hearer? Ask thyself the question. I
          pray thee, and do not deceive thyself in the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will just repeat the four different proofs again. If unto me a child
          is born then I have been born again; and, moreover, I am now in
          consequence of that new birth, a child. If, again, a Son has been
          given to me, then I am a son; and again I am given to that Son who is
          given to me. I have tried to put these tests in the way that the text
          would suggest them. I pray you carry them home with you. If you do not
          recollect the words, yet do recollect to search yourselves, and see,
          my hearers, whether you can say, |Unto me this Son is given.| For,
          indeed, if Christ is not my Christ, he is of little worth to me. If I
          cannot say he loved me and gave himself for me, of what avail is all
          the merit of his righteousness, or all the plenitude of his atonement?
          Bread in the shop is well enough, but if I am hungry and cannot get
          it, I starve although granaries be full. Water in the river is well
          enough but if I am in a desert and cannot reach the stream, if I can
          hear it in the distance and am yet lying down to die of thirst, the
          murmuring of the rill, or the flowing of the river, helps to tantalize
          me, while I die in dark despair. Better for you, my hearers to have
          perished as Hottentots, to have gone down to your graves as dwellers
          in some benighted land, than to live where the name of Christ is
          continually hymned and where his glory is extolled, and yet to go down
          to your tombs without an interest in him, unblessed by his gospel,
          unwashed in his blood, unclothed of his robe of righteousness. God
          help you, that you may be blessed in him, and may sing sweetly |Unto
          us a child is born, unto us a Son is given.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me to my second head, upon which I shall be brief. Is
          it so? IF IT IS SO, WHAT THEN? If it is so, why am I doubtful to-day?
          Why is my spirit questioning? Why do I not realize the fact? My
          hearer, if the Son is given to thee, how is it that thou art this day
          asking whether thou art Christ's, or not? Why dost thou not labor to
          make thy calling and election sure? Why tarriest thou in the plains of
          doubt? Get thee up, get thee up to the high mountains of confidence,
          and never rest till thou canst say without a fear that thou art
          mistaken, |I know that my Redeemer liveth. I am persuaded that he is
          able to keep that which I have committed to him.| I may have a large
          number of persons here to whom it is a matter of uncertainty as to
          whether Christ is theirs or not. Oh, my dear hearers, rest not content
          unless you know assuredly that Christ is yours, and that you are
          Christ's. Suppose you should see in to-morrow's newspaper, (although,
          by the way, if you believed anything you saw there you would probably
          be mistaken) but suppose you should see a notification that some rich
          man had left you an immense estate. Suppose, as you read it, you were
          well aware that the person mentioned was a relative of yours, and that
          it was likely to be true. It may be you have prepared to-morrow for a
          family meeting, and you are expecting brother John and sister Mary and
          their little ones to dine with you. But I very much question whether
          you would not be away from the head of the table to go and ascertain
          whether the fact were really so. |Oh,| you could say, |I am sure I
          should enjoy my Christmas dinner all the better if I were quite sure
          about this matter;| and all day, if you did not go, you would be on
          the tip-toe of expectation; you would be, as it were, sitting upon
          pins and needles until you knew whether it were the fact or not. Now
          there is a proclamation gone forth to-day, and it is a true one, too,
          that Jesus Christ has come into the world to save sinners. The
          question with you is whether he has saved you, and whether you have an
          interest in him. I beseech you, give no sleep to your eyes, and no
          slumber to your eyelids, till you have read your |title clear to
          mansions in the skies.| What, man! shall your eternal destiny be a
          matter of uncertainty to you? What! is heaven or hell involved in this
          matter, and will you rest until you know which of these shall be your
          everlasting portion? Are you content while it is a question whether
          God loves you, or whether he is angry with you? Can you be easy while
          you remain in doubt as to whether you are condemned in sin, or
          justified by faith which is in Christ Jesus? Get thee up, man. I
          beseech thee by the living God, and by thine own soul's safety, get
          thee up and read the records. Search and look, and try and test
          thyself, to see whether it be so or not. For if it be so, why should
          not we know it? If the Son is given to me, why should not I be sure of
          it? If the child is born to me, why should I not know it for a
          certainty, that I may even now live in the enjoyment of my privilege
          -- a privilege, the value of which I shall never know to the full,
          till I arrive in glory?
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, if it be so, another question. Why are we sad? I am looking
          upon faces just now that appear the very reverse of gloomy, but mayhap
          the smile covers an aching heart. Brother and sister, why are we sad
          this morning, if unto us a child is born, if unto us a Son is given?
          Hark, hark to the cry! It is |Harvest home! Harvest home!| See the
          maidens as they dance, and the young men as they make merry. And why
          is this mirth? Because they are storing the precious fruits of the
          earth, they are gathering together unto their barns wheat which will
          soon be consumed. And what, brothers and sisters have we the bread
          which endureth to eternal life and are we unhappy? Does the worldling
          rejoice when his corn is increased, and do we not rejoice when, |Unto
          us a child is born, and unto us a Son is given?| Hark, yonder! What
          means the firing of the Tower guns? Why all this ringing of bells in
          the church steeples, as if all London were mad with joy? There is a
          prince born; therefore there is this salute, and therefore are the
          bells ringing. Ah, Christians, ring the bells of your hearts, tire the
          salute of your most joyous songs, |For unto us a child is born, unto
          us a Son is given.| Dance, O my heart, and ring out peals of gladness!
          Ye drops of blood within my veins dance every one of you! Oh! all my
          nerves become harp strings, and let gratitude touch you with angelic
          fingers! And thou, my tongue, shout -- shout to his praise who hath
          said to thee -- |Unto thee a child is born, unto thee a Son is given.|
          Wipe that tear away! Come, stop that sighing! Hush yon murmuring. What
          matters your poverty? |Unto you a child is born.| What matters your
          sickness? |Unto you a Son is given.| What matters your sin? For this
          child shall take the sin away, and this Son shall wash and make you
          fit for heaven. I say, if it be so,
        </p>
        <p>|Lift up the heart, lift up the voice,</p>
        <p>Rejoice aloud! ye saints rejoice!|</p>
        <p>
          But, once more, if it be so, what then? Why are our hearts so cold?
          and why is it that we do so little for him who has done so much for
          us? Jesus, art thou mine? Am I saved? How is it that I love thee so
          little? Why is it that when I preach I am not more in earnest, and
          when I pray I am not more intensely fervent? How is it that we give so
          little to Christ who gave himself for us? How is it that we serve him
          so sadly who served us so perfectly? He consecrated himself wholly;
          how is it that our consecration is marred and partial? We are
          continually sacrificing to self and not to him?
        </p>
        <p>
          O beloved brethren, yield yourselves up this morning. What have you
          got in the world? |Oh,| saith one, |I have nothing; I am poor and
          penniless, and all but homeless.| Give thyself to Christ. You have
          heard the story of the pupils to a Greek philosopher. On a certain day
          it was the custom to give to the philosopher a present. One came and
          gave him gold. Another could not bring him gold but brought him
          silver. One brought him a robe, and another some delicacy for food.
          But one of them came up, and said, |Oh, Solon, I am poor, I have
          nothing to give to thee, but yet I will give thee something better
          than all these have given; I give thee myself.| Now, if you have gold
          and silver, if you have aught of this world's goods, give in your
          measure to Christ; but take care, above all, that you give yourself to
          him, and let your cry be from this day forth,
        </p>
        <p>|Do not I love thee dearest Lord?</p>
        <p>Oh search my heart and see,</p>
        <p>And turn each cursed idol out</p>
        <p>That dares to rival thee.</p>
        <p>Do not I love thee from my soul?</p>
        <p>Then let me nothing love:</p>
        <p>Dead be my heart to every joy,</p>
        <p>When Jesus cannot move.|</p>
        <p>
          III. Well, now I have all but done, but give your solemn, very solemn
          attention, while I come to my last head: -- IF IT IS NOT SO, WHAT
          THEN? Dear hearer, I cannot tell where thou art -- but wherever thou
          mayst be in this hall, the eyes of my heart are looking for thee, that
          when they have seen thee, they may weep over thee. Ah! miserable
          wretch, without a hope, without Christ, without God. Unto thee there
          is no Christmas mirth, for thee no child is born; to thee no Son is
          given. Sad is the story of the poor men and women, who during the week
          before last fell down dead in our streets through cruel hunger and
          bitter cold. But far more pitiable is thy lot, far more terrible shall
          be thy condition in the day when thou shalt cry for a drop of water to
          cool thy burning tongue, and it shall be denied thee; when thou shalt
          seek for death, for grim cold death -- seek for him as for a friend,
          and yet thou shalt not find him. For the fire of hell shall not
          consume thee, nor its terrors devour thee. Thou shalt long to die, yet
          shalt thou linger in eternal death -- dying every hour, yet never
          receiving the much coveted boon of death. What shall I say to thee
          this morning? Oh! Master, help me to speak a word in season, now. I
          beseech thee, my hearer, if Christ is not thine this morning, may God
          the Spirit help thee to do what I now command thee to do. First of
          all, confess thy sins; not into my ear, nor into the ear of any living
          man. Go to thy chamber and confess that thou art vile. Tell him thou
          art a wretch undone without his sovereign grace. But do not think
          there is any merit in confession. There is none. All your confession
          cannot merit forgiveness, though God has promised to pardon the man
          who confesses his sin and forsakes it. Imagine that some creditor had
          a debtor who owed him a thousand pounds. He calls upon him and says,
          |I demand my money.| But, says the other, |I owe you nothing.| That
          man will be arrested and thrown into prison. However, his creditor
          says, |I wish to deal mercifully with you, make a frank confession,
          and I will forgive you all the debt.| |Well,| says the man, |I do
          acknowledge that I owe you two hundred pounds.| |No,| says he, |that
          will not do.| |Well, sir, I confess I owe you five hundred pounds,|
          and by degrees he comes to confess that he owes the thousand. Is there
          any merit in that confession? No; but yet you could see that no
          creditor would think of forgiving a debt which was not acknowledged.
          It is the least that you can do, to acknowledge your sin; and though
          there be no merit in the confession, yet true to his promise, God will
          give you pardon through Christ. That is one piece of advice. I pray
          you take it. Do not throw it to the winds; do not leave it as soon as
          you get out of Exeter Hall. Take it with you, and may this day become
          a confession-day with many of you. But next, when you have made a
          confession, I beseech you renounce yourself. You have been resting
          perhaps in some hope that you would make yourself better, and so save
          yourself. Give up that delusive fancy. You have seen the silk-worm: it
          will spin, and spin, and spin, and then it will die where it has spun
          itself a shroud. And your good works are but a spinning for yourself a
          robe for your dead soul. You can do nothing by your best prayers, your
          best tears, or your best works, to merit eternal life. Why, the
          Christian who is converted to God, will tell you that he cannot live a
          holy life by himself. If the ship in the sea cannot steer itself
          aright, do you think the wood that lies in the carpenter's yard can
          put itself together, and make itself into a ship, and then go out to
          sea and sail to America? Yet, this is just what you imagine. The
          Christian who is God's workmanship can do nothing, and yet you think
          you can do something. Now, give up self. God help you to strike a
          black mark through every idea of what you can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, lastly, and I pray God help you here my dear hearers, when thou
          hast confessed thy sin and given up all hope of self-salvation, go to
          the place where Jesus died in agony. Go then in meditation to Calvary.
          There he hangs. It is the middle cross of these three. Methinks I see
          him now. I see his poor face emaciated, and his visage more marred
          than that of any man. I see the beady drops of blood still standing
          round his pierced temples -- marks of that rugged thorn-crown. Ah, I
          see his body naked -- naked to his shame. We may tell all his bones.
          See there his hands rent with the rough iron, and his feet torn with
          the nails. The nails have rent through his flesh. There is now not
          only the hole through which the nail was driven, but the weight of his
          body has sunken upon his feet, and see the iron is tearing through his
          flesh. And now the weight of his body hangs upon his arms, and the
          nails there are rending through the tender nerves. Hark! earth is
          startled! He cries, |Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?| Oh, sinner, was ever
          shriek like that? God hath forsaken him. His God has ceased to be
          gracious to him. His soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death.
          But hark, again, he cries, |I thirst!| Give him water! give him water!
          Ye holy women let him drink. But no, his murderers torture him. They
          thrust into his mouth the vinegar mingled with gall -- the bitter with
          the sharp, the vinegar and the gall. At last, hear him, sinner, for
          here is your hope. I see him bow his awful head. The King of heaven
          dies. The God who made the earth has become a man, and the man is
          about to expire. Hear him! He cries, |It is finished!| and he gives up
          the ghost. The atonement is finished, the price is paid, the bloody
          ransom counted down, the sacrifice is accepted. |It is finished!|
          Sinner, believe in Christ. Cast thyself on him. Sink or swim, take him
          to be thy all in all. Throw now thy trembling arms around that
          bleeding body. Sit now at the feet of that cross, and feel the
          dropping of the precious blood. And as you go out each one of you say
          in your hearts,
        </p>
        <p>|A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,</p>
        <p>On Christ's kind arms I fall,</p>
        <p>He is my strength and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My Jesus, and my all.|</p>
        <p>
          God grant you grace to do so for Jesus Christ's sake. May the grace of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the
          Holy Ghost, be with you all, for ever and ever. Amen and Amen.
