        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |As soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.| -- Isaiah
          66:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          ISRAEL had fallen into the lowest condition, but an inward yearning of
          heart was felt in the midst of God's people for the return of the
          divine blessing; and no sooner had this anxious desire become intense,
          than God heard the voice of its cry, and the blessing came. It was so
          at the time of the restoration of the captives from Babylon, and it
          was most evidently so in the days of our Lord. A faithful company had
          continued still to expect the coming of the Lord's anointed messenger;
          they waited till he should suddenly come in his temple; the twelve
          tribes, represented by an elect remnant, cried day and night unto the
          Most High, and when at last their prayers reached the fulness of
          vehemence, and their anxiety wrought in them the deepest agony of
          spirit, then the Messiah came; the light of the gentiles, and the
          glory of Israel. Then began the age of blessedness in which the barren
          woman did keep house and become the joyful mother of children. The
          Holy Ghost was given, and multitudes were born to the church of God,
          yea we may say, a nation was born in a day. The wilderness and the
          solitary place were glad for them, and the desert rejoiced and
          blossomed as the rose. We are not, however, about to enter into the
          particular application of our text as Isaiah uttered it: the great
          declarations of revelation are applicable to all cases, and, once
          true, they stand fast for ever and ever. Earnestly desiring that God
          may give a large spiritual blessing to his church this morning,
          through the subject to which my mind has been directed, I shall first
          ask you to note that in order to the obtaining of an increase to the
          church, there must be travail, and that, secondly, this travail is
          frequently followed by surprising results. I shall then have to show
          why both the travail and the result are desirable, and pronounce woe
          on those who stand back and hinder it, and a blessing on such as shall
          be moved by God's own Spirit to travail for souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is clear from the text, |As soon as Zion travailed, she brought
          forth her children,| that THERE MUST BE THE TRAVAIL before there will
          be the spiritual birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me first establish this fact from history. Before there has fallen
          a great benediction upon God's people, it has been preceded by great
          searchings of heart. Israel was so oppressed in Egypt, that it would
          have been very easy, and almost a natural thing, for the people to
          become so utterly crushed in spirit as to submit to be hereditary
          bond-slaves, making the best they could of their miserable lot; but
          God would not have it so; he meant to bring them out |with a high hand
          and an outstretched arm.| Before, however, he began to work, he made
          them begin to cry. Their sighs and cries came up into the ears of God,
          and he stretched out his hand to deliver them. Doubtless, many a
          heart-rending appeal was made to heaven by mothers when their babes
          were torn from their breasts to be cast into the river. With what
          bitterness did they ask God to look upon his poor people Israel, and
          avenge them of their oppressors. The young men bowed under the cruel
          yoke and groaned, while hoary sires, smarting under ignominious lashes
          from the taskmaster, sighed and wept before the God of Israel. The
          whole nation cried, |O God visit us; God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
          Jacob, remember thy covenant, and deliver us.| This travail brought
          its result; for the Lord smote the field of Zoan with mighty plagues,
          and forth from under the bondage of the sons of Misraim, the children
          of Israel marched with joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we shall not have time to narrate many instances, let us take a
          long leap in history to the days of David. The era of the son of Jesse
          was evidently a time of religious revival. God was honored and his
          service maintained in the midst of Judea's land in the days of the
          royal bard; but it is clear to readers of the Scriptures that David
          was the subject of spiritual throes and pangs of the most intense
          kind. His bosom throbbed and heaved like that of a man made fit to be
          the leader of a great revival. What yearnings he had! He thirsted
          after God, after the living God! What petitions he poured forth that
          God would visit Zion, and make the vine which he had planted to
          flourish once again. Even when his own sins pressed heavily upon him,
          he could not end his personal confession without entreating the Lord
          to build the walls of Jerusalem, and to do good in his good pleasure
          unto Zion. Now, David was only the mouth of hundreds of others, who
          with equal fervency cried unto God that the blessing might rest upon
          his people. There was much soul-travail in Israel and Judah, and the
          result was that the Lord was glorified, and true religion flourished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember also the days of Josiah, the king. You know well now the book
          of the law was found neglected in the temple, and when it was brought
          before the king, he rent his clothes, for he saw that the nation had
          revolted, and that wrath must come upon it to the uttermost. The young
          king's heart, which was tender, for he feared God, was ready to break
          with anguish to think of the misery that would come upon his people on
          account of their sins. Then there came a glorious reformation which
          purged the land of idols, and caused the passover to be observed as
          never before. Travails of heart among the godly produced the
          delightful change.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the same with the work of Nehemiah. His book begins with a
          description of the travail of his heart. He was a patriot, a man of
          nervous, excitable temperament, and keen sensibility for God's honor,
          and when his soul had felt great bitterness and longing, then he arose
          to build, and a blessing rested on his efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early dawn of Christian history, there was a preparation of the
          church before it received an increase. Look at the obedient disciples
          sitting in the upper room, waiting with anxious hope; every heart
          there had been ploughed with anguish by the death of the Lord, each
          one was intent to receive the promised boon of the Spirit. There, with
          one heart and one mind, they tarried, but not without wrestling
          prayer, and so the Comforter was given, and three thousand souls were
          given also.
        </p>
        <p>
          The like living zeal and vehement desire have always been perceptible
          in the Church of God before any season of refreshing. Think not that
          Luther was the only man that wrought the Reformation. There were
          hundreds who sighed and cried in secret in the cottages of the Black
          Forest, in the homes of Germany, and on the hills of Switzerland.
          There were hearts breaking for the Lord's appearing in strange places,
          they might have been found in the palaces of Spain, in the dungeons of
          the Inquisition, among the canals of Holland, and the green lanes of
          England. Women, as they hid their Bibles, lest their lives should be
          forfeited, cried out in spirit, |O God, how long?| There were pains as
          of a woman in travail, in secret places there were tears and bitter
          lamentations, on the high places of the field there were mighty
          strivings of spirit, and so at length there came that grand revulsion
          which made the Vatican to rock and reel from its foundation to its
          pinnacle. There has been evermore in the history of the church, the
          travail before there has been the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this, dear friends, while it is true on the large scale, is true
          also in every individual case. A man with no sensibility or compassion
          for other men's souls, may accidentally be the means of a conversion;
          the good word which he utters will not cease to be good because the
          speaker had no right to declare God's statutes. The bread and meat
          which were brought to Elijah were not less nourishing because the
          ravens brought them, but the ravens remained ravens still. A
          hard-hearted man may say a good thing which God will bless, but, as a
          rule, those who bring souls to Christ are those who first of all have
          felt an agony of desire that souls should be saved. This is imaged to
          us in our Master's character. He is the great Saviour of men; but
          before he could save others, he learned in their flesh to sympathize
          with them. He wept over Jerusalem, he sweat great drops of blood in
          Gethsemane; he was, and is, a high priest who is touched with the
          feeling of our infirmities. As the Captain of our salvation, in
          bringing many sons unto glory he was made perfect by sufferings. Even
          Christ went not forth to preach until he had spent nights in
          intercessory prayer, and uttered strong cryings and tears for the
          salvation of his hearers. His ministering servants who have been most
          useful, have always been eagerly desirous to be so. If any minister
          can be satisfied without conversions, he shall have no conversions.
          God will not force usefulness on any man. It is only when our heart
          breaks to see men saved, that we shall be likely to see sinners'
          hearts broken. The secret of success lies in all-consuming zeal,
          all-subduing travail for souls. Read the sermons of Wesley and of
          Whitfield, and what is there in them? It is no severe criticism to say
          that they are scarcely worthy to have survived, and yet those sermons
          wrought marvels, and well they might, for both preachers could truly
          say --
        </p>
        <p>|The love of Christ doth me constrain</p>
        <p>To seek the wandering souls of men;</p>
        <p>With cries, entreaties, tears, to save,</p>
        <p>To snatch them from the fiery wave.|</p>
        <p>
          In order to understand such preaching, you need to see and hear the
          man, you want his tearful eye, his glowing countenance, his pleading
          tone, his bursting heart. I have heard of a great preacher who
          objected to having his sermons printed, |Because,| said he, |you
          cannot print me.| That observation is very much to the point. A
          soul-winner throws himself into what he says. As I have sometimes
          said, we must ram ourselves into our cannons, we must fire ourselves
          at our hearers, and when we do this, then, by God's grace, their
          hearts are often carried by storm. Do any of you desire your
          children's conversions? You shall have them saved when you agonize for
          them. Many a parent who has been privileged to see his son walking in
          the truth, will tell you that before the blessing came he had spent
          many hours in prayer and in earnest pleading with God, and then it was
          that the Lord visited his child and renewed his soul. I have heard of
          a young man who had grown up and left the parental roof, and through
          evil influences, had been enticed into holding skeptical views. His
          father and mother were both earnest Christians, and it almost broke
          their hearts to see their son so opposed to the Redeemer. On one
          occasion they induced him to go with them to hear a celebrated
          minister. He accompanied them simply to please them, and for no higher
          motive. The sermon happened to be upon the glories of heaven. It was a
          very extraordinary sermon, and was calculated to make every Christian
          in the audience to leap for joy. The young man was much gratified with
          the eloquence of the preacher, but nothing more; he gave him credit
          for superior oratorical ability, and was interested in the sermon, but
          felt none of its power. He chanced to look at his father and mother
          during the discourse, and was surprised to see them weeping. He could
          not imagine why they, being Christian people, should sit and weep
          under a sermon which was most jubilant in its strain. When he reached
          home, he said, |Father, we have had a capital sermon, but I could not
          understand what could make you sit there and cry, and my mother too?|
          His father said, |My dear son, I certainly had no reason to weep
          concerning myself, nor your mother, but I could not help thinking all
          through the sermon about you, for alas, I have no hope that you will
          be a partaker in the bright joys which await the righteous. It breaks
          my heart to think that you will be shut out of heaven.| His mother
          said, |The very same thoughts crossed my mind, and the more the
          preacher spoke of the joys of the saved, the more I sorrowed for my
          dear boy that he should never know what they were.| That touched the
          young man's heart, led him to seek his father's God, and before long
          he was at the same communion table, rejoicing in the God and Saviour
          whom his parents worshiped. The travail comes before the bringing
          forth; the earnest anxiety, the deep emotion within, precede our being
          made the instruments of the salvation of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have established the fact; now for a minute or two let me
          show you the reason for it. Why is it that there must be this anxiety
          before desirable results are gained? For answer, it might suffice us
          to say that God has so appointed it. It is the order of nature. The
          child is not born into the world without the sorrows of the mother,
          nor is the bread which sustains life procured from the earth without
          toil: |In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,| was a part of
          the primeval curse. Now, as it is in the natural, so is it in the
          spiritual; there shall not come the blessing we seek, without first of
          all the earnest yearning for it. Why, it is so even in ordinary
          business. We say, |No sweat no sweet,| |no pains no gains,| |No mill
          no meal.| If there be no labor there shall be no profit. He that would
          be rich must toil for it; he that would acquire fame must spend and be
          spent to win it. It is ever so. There must ever be the travail and
          then the desire cometh. God has so appointed it: let us accept the
          decree.
        </p>
        <p>
          But better still, he has ordained this for our good. If souls were
          given us without any effort, anxiety or prayer it would be our loss to
          have it so, because the anxieties which throb within a compassionate
          spirit exercise his graces; they produce grateful love to God; they
          try his faith in the power of God to save others; they drive him to
          the mercy-seat; they strengthen his patience and perseverance, and
          every grace within the man is educated and increased by his travail
          for souls. As labor is now a blessing, so also is soul-travail; men
          are fashioned more fully into the likeness of Christ thereby, and the
          whole church is by the same emotion quickened into energy. The fire of
          our own spiritual life is fanned by that same breath which our prayers
          invite to come from the four winds to breath upon the slain. Besides,
          dear friends, the zeal that God excites within us is often the means
          of effecting the purpose which we desire. After all, God does not give
          conversions to eloquence, but to heart. The power in the hand of God's
          Spirit for conversions is heart coming in contact with heart. This is
          God's battle-axe and weapons of war in his crusade. He is pleased to
          use the yearnings, longings, and sympathies of Christian men, as the
          means of compelling the careless to think, constraining the hardened
          to feel, and driving the unbelieving to consider. I have little
          confidence in elaborate speech and polished sentences, as the means of
          reaching men's hearts; but I have great faith in that simple-minded
          Christian woman, who must have souls converted or she will weep her
          eyes out over them; and in that humble Christian who prays day and
          night in secret, and then avails himself of every opportunity to
          address a loving word to sinners. The emotion we feel, and the
          affection we bear, are the most powerful implements of soul-winning.
          God the Holy Ghost usually breaks hard hearts by tender hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the travail qualifies for the proper taking care of the
          offspring. God does not commit his new-born children to people who do
          not care to see conversions. If he ever allows them to fall into such
          hands, they suffer very serious loss thereby. Who is so fit to
          encourage a new-born believer as the man who first anguished before
          the Lord for his conversion? Those you have wept over and prayed for
          you will be sure to encourage and assist. The church that never
          travailed, should God send her a hundred converts, would be unfit to
          train them; she would not know what to do with little children, and
          would leave them to much suffering. Let us thank God, brethren, if he
          has given us any degree of the earnest anxiety and sympathy, which
          marked soul-wining men and women, and let us ask to have more for, in
          proportion as we have it, we shall be qualified to be the instruments
          in the hand of the Spirit, of nursing and cherishing God's sons and
          daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, there is a great benefit in the law which makes travail
          necessary to spiritual birth, because it secures all the glory to God.
          If you want to be lowered in your own esteem, try to convert a child.
          I would like those brethren who believe so much in free will, and the
          natural goodness of the human heart, to try some children that I could
          bring to them, and see whether they could break their hearts and make
          them love the Saviour. Why, sir, you never think yourself so great a
          fool as after trying in your own strength to bring a sinner to the
          Saviour. Oh! How often have I come back defeated from arguing with an
          awakened person whom I have sought to comfort: I did think I had some
          measure of skill in handling sorrowful cases, but I have been
          compelled to say to myself, |What a simpleton I am! God the Holy Ghost
          must take this case in hand, for I am foiled.| When one has tried in a
          sermon to reach a certain person who is living in sin, you learn
          afterwards that he enjoyed the sermon which he ought to have smarted
          under; then, you say, |Ah, now I see what a weak worm I am, and if
          good be done, God shall have the glory.| Your longing, then, that
          others should be saved, and your vehemence of spirit, shall secure to
          God all the glory of his own work; and this is what the Lord is aiming
          at, for his glory he will not give to another, nor his praise to an
          arm of flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, having established the fact, and shown the reasons for it,
          let us notice how this travail shows itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually when God intends greatly to bless a church, it will begin in
          this way: -- Two or three persons in it are distressed at the low
          state of affairs, and become troubled even to anguish. Perhaps they do
          not speak to one another, or know of their common grief, but they
          begin to pray with flaming desire and untiring importunity. The
          passion to see the church revived rules them. They think of it when
          they go to rest, they dream of it on their bed, they muse on it in the
          streets. This one thing eats them up. They suffer great heaviness and
          continual sorrow in heart for perishing sinners; they travail in birth
          for souls. I have happened to become the centre of certain brethren in
          this church; one of them said to me the other day, |O sir, I pray day
          and night for God to prosper our church; I long to see greater things;
          God is blessing us, but we want much more.| I saw the deep earnestness
          of the man's soul, and I thanked him and thanked God heartily,
          thinking it to be a sure sign of a coming blessing. Sometime after,
          another friend, who probably now hears me speak, but who did not know
          any thing about the other, felt the same yearning, and must needs let
          me know it; he too is anxious, longing, begging, crying, for a
          revival; and thus from three or four quarters I have had the same
          message, and I feel hopeful because of these tokens for good. When the
          sun rises the mountain tops first catch the light, and those who
          constantly live near to God will be the first to feel the influence of
          the coming refreshing. The Lord give me a dozen importunate pleaders
          and lovers of souls, and by his grace we will shake all London from
          end to end yet. The work would go on without the mass of you,
          Christians; many of you only hinder the march of the army; but give us
          a dozen lion-like, lamb-like men, burning with intense love to Christ
          and souls, and nothing will be impossible to their faith. The most of
          us are not worthy to unloose the shoe-latches of ardent saints. I
          often feel I am not so myself, but I aspire and long to be reckoned
          among them. Oh, may God give us this first sign of the travail in the
          earnest ones and twos.
        </p>
        <p>
          By degrees the individuals are drawn together by sacred affinity, and
          the prayer-meetings become very different. The brother who talked
          twenty minutes of what he called prayer, and yet never asked for a
          single thing, gives up his oration and falls to pleading with many
          tears and broken sentences: while the friend who used to relate his
          experience and go through the doctrines of grace, and call that a
          prayer, forgets that rigmarole and begins agonizing before the throne.
          And not only this, but little knots here and there come together in
          their cottages, and in their little rooms cry mightily to God. The
          result will be that the minister, even if he does not know of the
          feeling in the hearts of his people, will grow fervent himself. He
          will preach more evangelically, more tenderly, more earnestly. He will
          be no longer formal, or cold, or stereotyped; he will be all alive.
          Meanwhile, not with the preacher only will be the blessing, but with
          his hearers who love the Lord. One will be trying a plan for getting
          in the young people; another will be looking after the strangers in
          the aisles, who come only now and then. One brother will make a
          vehement attempt to preach the gospel at the corner of the street;
          another will open a room down a dark court; another will visit
          lodging-houses and hospitals; all sorts of holy plans will be
          invented, and zeal will break out in many directions. All this will be
          spontaneous, nothing will be forced. If you want to get up a revival,
          as the term is, you can do it, just as you can grow tasteless
          strawberries in winter, by artificial heat. There are ways and means
          of doing that kind of thing but the genuine work of God needs no such
          planning and scheming; it is altogether spontaneous. If you see a
          snowdrop next February in your garden, you will feel persuaded that
          spring is on the way; the artificial-flower maker could put as many
          snow-drops there as you please, but that would be no index of coming
          spring. So you may get up an apparent zeal which will be no proof of
          God's blessing; but when fervor comes of itself, without human
          direction or control, then is it of the Lord. When men's hearts heave
          and break, like the mould of the garden under the influence of the
          reviving life which lay buried there, then in very deed a benediction
          is on the way. Travail is no mockery, but a real agony of the whole
          nature. May such be seen in this our church, and throughout the whole
          Israel of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, with great brevity, let us consider that THE RESULT IS OFTEN
          VERY SURPRISING. It is frequently surprising for rapidity. |As soon as
          Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.| God's works are not
          tied by time. The more spiritual a force is the less it lies within
          the chains of time. The electric current, which has a greater nearness
          to the spiritual than the grosser forms of materialism, is
          inconceivably rapid from that very reason, and by it time is all but
          annihilated. The influences of the Spirit of God are a force most
          spiritual, and more quick than any thing beneath the sun. As soon as
          we agonize in soul the Holy Spirit can, if he pleases, convert the
          person for whom we have pleaded. While we are yet speaking he hears,
          and before we call he answers. Some calculate the expected progress of
          a church by arithmetic; and I think I have heard of arithmetical
          sermons in which there have been ingenious calculations as to how many
          missionaries it would take to convert the world, and how much cash
          would be demanded. Now, there is no room here for the application of
          mathematics; spiritual forces are not calculable by an arithmetic
          which is most at home in the material universe. A truth which is
          calculated to strike the mind of one man to-day may readily enough
          produce a like effect upon a million minds to-morrow. The preaching
          which moves one heart needs not be altered to tell upon ten thousand.
          With God's Spirit our present instrumentalities will suffice to win
          the world to Jesus; without him, ten thousand times as much apparent
          force would be only so much weakness. The spread of truth, moreover,
          is not reckonable by time. During the ten years which ended in 1870,
          such wondrous changes were wrought throughout the world that no
          prophet would have been believed had he foretold them. Reforms have
          been accomplished in England, in the United States, in Germany, in
          Spain, in Italy, which according to ordinary reckoning, would have
          occupied at least one hundred years. Things which concern the mind
          cannot be subjected to those regulations of time which govern
          steamboats and railways; in such matters God's messengers are flames
          of fire. The Spirit of God is able to operate upon the minds of men
          instantaneously: witness the case of Paul. Between now and to-morrow
          morning he could excite holy thought in all the minds of all the
          thousand millions of the sons of Adam; and if prayer were mighty
          enough, and strong enough, why should it not be done on some bright
          day? We are not straitened in him, we are straitened in our own
          bowels. All the fault lies there. Oh for the travail that would
          produce immediate results.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the result is surprising, not only for its rapidity, but for the
          greatness of it. It is said, |Shall a nation be born at once?| As soon
          as ever Zion was in distress concerning her children, tens of
          thousands came and built up Jerusalem, and re-established her fallen
          state. So, in answer to prayer, God not only bestows speedy blessings,
          but great blessings. There were fervent prayers in that upper room
          |before the day of Pentecost had fully come,| and what a great answer
          it was when, after Peter's sermon, some three thousand were ready to
          confess their faith in Christ, and to be baptized. Shall we never see
          such things again? Is the Spirit straitened? Has his arm waxed short?
          Nay, verily, but we clog and hinder him. He cannot do any mighty work
          here because of our unbelief; and, if our unbelief were cast out, and
          if prayer went up to God with eagerness, and vehemence, and
          importunity, then would a blessing descend so copious as to amaze us
          all.
        </p>
        <p>But enough of this, for I must needs pass on to the next point.</p>
        <p>
          III. THIS TRAVAIL AND ITS RESULT ARE ABUNDANTLY DESIRABLE;
          pre-eminently desirable at this hour. The world is perishing for a
          lack of knowledge. Did any one among us ever lay China on his heart?
          Your imagination cannot grapple with the population of that mighty
          empire, without God, without Christ, strangers to the commonwealth of
          Israel. But it is not China alone; there are other vast nations lying
          in darkness; the great serpent hath coiled himself around the globe,
          and who shall set the world free from him? Reflect upon this one city
          with its three millions. What sin the moon sees! What sin the Sabbath
          sees! Alas for the transgressions of this wicked city. Babylon of old
          could not have been worse than London is, nor so guilty, for she had
          not the light that London has received. Brethren, there is no hope for
          China, no hope for the world, no hope for our own city, while the
          church is sluggish and lethargic. Through the church the blessing is
          usually bestowed. Christ multiplies the bread, and gives it to the
          disciples; the multitudes can only get it through the disciples. Oh,
          it is time, it is high time that the churches were awakened to seek
          the good of dying myriads. Moreover, brethren, the powers of evil are
          ever active. We may sleep, but Satan sleepeth never. The church's
          plough lies yonder, rusting in the furrow; do you not see it to your
          shame? But the plough of Satan goes from end to end of his great
          field, he leaves no headland, but he ploughs deep while sluggish
          churches sleep. May we be stirred as we see the awful activity of evil
          spirits and persons who are under their sway. How industriously
          pernicious literature is spread abroad, and with what a zeal do men
          seek for fresh ways of sinning. He is eminent among men who can invent
          fresh songs to gratify the lascivious tongue, or find new spectacles
          to delight unclean eyes. O God, are thine enemies awake, and only thy
          friends asleep? O Sufferer, once bathed in bloody sweat in Gethsemane,
          is there not one of the twelve awake but Judas? Are they all asleep
          except the traitor? May God arouse us for his infinite mercy's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this, my brethren, when a church is not serving God, mischief
          is brewing withing herself. While she is not bringing others in, her
          own heart is becoming weak in its pulsations, and her entire
          constitution is a prey to decline. The church must either bring forth
          children unto God, or else die of consumption: she has no alternative
          but that. A church must either be fruitful or rot, and of all things,
          a rotting church is the most offensive. Would God we could bury our
          dead churches out of our sight, as Abraham buried Sarah, for above
          ground they breed a pestilence of scepticism; for men say, |Is this
          religion?| and taking it to be so, they forego true religion
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, worst of all is, God is not glorified. If there be no
          yearning of heart in the church, and no conversions, where is the
          travail of the Redeemer's soul? Where, Immanuel, where are the
          trophies of thy terrible conflict? Where are the jewels for thy crown?
          Thou shalt have thine own, thy Father's will shall not be frustrated;
          thou shalt be adored; but as yet we see it not. Hard are men's hearts,
          and they will not love thee; unyielding are their wills, and they will
          not own thy sovereignty. Oh! weep because Jesus is not honored. The
          foul oath still curdles our blood as we hear it, and blasphemy usurps
          the place of grateful song. Oh! by the wounds and bloody sweat, by the
          cross and nails, and spear, I beseech you followers of Christ, be in
          earnest, that Jesus Christ's name may be known and loved through the
          earnest agonizing endeavors of the Christian church.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I must come near to a close, by, in the fourth place,
          noticing THE WOE WHICH WILL SURELY COME TO THOSE WHO HINDER THE
          TRAVAIL OF THE CHURCH, and so prevent the bringing forth of her
          children. An earnest spirit cannot complete its exhortations to zeal
          without pronouncing a denunciation upon the indifferent. What said the
          heroine of old who had gone forth against the enemies of Israel, when
          she remembered coward spirits? |Curse ye Meroz, saith the angel of the
          Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not
          to the help of the Lord against the mighty.| Some such curse will
          assuredly come upon every professing Christian who is backward in
          helping the church in the day on her soul's travail. And who are they
          that hinder her? I answer, every worldly Christian hinders the
          progress of the gospel. Every member of a church who is living in
          secret sin, who is tolerating in his heart any thing that he knows to
          be wrong, who is not seeking eagerly his own personal sanctification,
          is to that extent hindering the work of the Spirit of God. |Be ye
          clean that bear the vessels of the Lord,| for to the extent that we
          maintain known unholiness, we restrain the Spirit. He cannot work by
          us as long as any conscious sin is tolerated. It is not over breaking
          of commandments that I am now speaking of, brethren, but I include
          worldliness also -- a care for carnal things, and a carelessness about
          spiritual things, having enough grace just to make us hope that you
          are a Christian, but not enough to prove you are; bearing a shriveled
          apple here and there on the topmost bough, but not much fruit; this I
          mean, this partial barrenness, not complete enough to condemn, yet
          complete enough to restrain the blessing, this robs the treasure of
          the church, and hinders her progress. O brethren, if any of you are
          thus described, repent and do your first works; and God help you to be
          foremost in proportion as you have been behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are also guilty who distract the mind of the church from the
          subject in hand. Anybody who calls off the thoughts of the church from
          soul-saving is a mischief maker. I have heard it said of a minister,
          |He greatly influences the politics of the town.| Well, it is a very
          doubtful good in my mind, a very doubtful good indeed. If the man,
          keeping to his own calling of preaching the gospel, happens to
          influence these meaner things, it is well, but any Christian minister
          who thinks that he can do two things well, is mistaken. Let him mind
          soul-winning, and not turn a Christian church into a political club.
          Let us fight out our politics somewhere else, but not inside the
          church of God. There our one business is soul-winning, our one banner
          is the cross, our one leader is the crucified King. Inside the church
          there may be minor things that take off the thoughts of men from
          seeking souls, -- little things that can be made beneath the eye that
          is microscopical, to swell into great offences. Oh, my brethren, let
          us, while souls are perishing, waive personal differences. |It must
          need be that offences come, but woe unto him by whom the offence
          cometh;| but, after all, what can there be that is worth taking notice
          of, compared with glorifying Christ. If our Lord and Master would be
          honored by your being a doormat for his saints to wipe their feet on,
          you would be honored to be in the position; and if there shall come
          glory to God by your patient endurance, even of insult and contumely,
          be glad in your heart that you are permitted to be nothing that Christ
          may be all in all. We must by no means turn aside to this or that; not
          even golden apples must tempt us in this race! There lies the mark,
          and until it is reached, we must never pause, but onward press, for
          Christ's cause and crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, my brethren, we shall be hindering the travail of the
          church if we do not share in it. Many church members think that if
          they do nothing wrong, and make no trouble, then they are all right.
          Not at all, sir; not at all. Here is a chariot, and we are all engaged
          to drag it. Some of you do not put out your hands to pull; well, then,
          the rest of us have to labor so much the more; and the worst of it is
          we have to draw you also. While you do not add to the strength which
          draws, you increase the weight that is to be drawn. It is all very
          well for you to say, |But I do not hinder;| you do hinder, you cannot
          help hindering. If a man's leg does not help him in walking, it
          certainly hinders him. Oh, I cannot bear to think of it. That I should
          be a hindrance to my own sou's growth is bad indeed; but that I should
          stand in the way of the people of God and cool their courage, and damp
          their ardor -- my Master, let it never be! Sooner let me sleep among
          the clods of the valley, than be a hindrance to the meanest work that
          is done for thy name.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now I shall close, not with this note of woe, but with A WORD
          OF BLESSING. Depend upon it there shall come a great blessing to any
          of you who feel the soul travail that brings souls to God. Your own
          heart will be watered. You know the old illustration, so often used
          that it is now almost hackneyed, of the two travelers, who passed a
          man frozen in the snow, and thought to be dead; and the one said, |I
          have enough to do to keep myself alive, I will hasten on;| but the
          other said, |I cannot pass a fellow-creature while there is the least
          breath in him.| He stooped down and began to warm the frozen man by
          rubbing him with great vigor; and at last the poor fellow opened his
          eyes, came back to life and animation, and walked along with the man
          who had restored him to life; and what think you was one of the fist
          sights they saw? It was the man who so selfishly took care of himself
          frozen to death. The good Samaritan had preserved his own life by
          rubbing the other man; the friction he had given had caused the action
          of his own blood, and kept him in vigor. You will bless yourselves if
          you bless others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, will it not be a joy to feel that you have done what you
          could? It is always well on a Sunday evening for a preacher to feel
          when he gets home, |Well, I may not have preached as I could wish, but
          I have preached the Lord Jesus, and poured forth all my heart and I
          could do no more.| He sleeps soundly on that. After a day spent in
          doing all the good you can, even if you have met with no success, you
          can lean your head on Christ's bosom and fall asleep, feeling that if
          souls be not gathered, yet you have your reward. If men are lost, it
          is some satisfaction to us that they were not lost because we failed
          to tell them the way of salvation. But what a comfort it will be to
          you supposing you should be successful in bringing some to Christ. Why
          it will set all the bells of your soul ringing. There is no greater
          joy except the joy of our own communion with Christ, than this of
          bringing others to trust the Saviour. Oh seek this joy and pant after
          it. And what if you should see your own children converted? You have
          long hoped for it, but your hopes have been disappointed; God means to
          give you that choice blessing when you live more nearly to him
          yourself. Yes, wife, the husband's heart will be won when your heart
          is perfectly consecrated. Yes, mother, the girl shall love the Saviour
          when you love him better. Yes, teacher, God means to bless your class,
          but not until first of all he has made you fit to receive the
          blessing. Why, now, if your children were to be converted through your
          teacher, you would be mightily proud of it: God knows you could not
          bear such success, and does not mean to give it until he has laid you
          low at his feet, and emptied you of yourself, and filled you with
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I ask the prayers of all this church, that God would send us a
          time of revival. I have not to complain that I have labored in vain,
          and spent my strength for nought; far from it. I have not even to
          think that the blessing is withdrawn from the preaching of the word,
          even in a measure, for I never had so many cases of conversion in my
          life as I have known since I have been restored from sickness; I have
          never before received so many letters in so short a time, telling me
          that the sermons printed have been blest, or the sermons preached
          here; yet I do not think we ever had so few conversions from the
          regular congregation. I partly account for it from the fact, that you
          cannot fish in one pond always and catch as many fish as at first.
          Perhaps the Lord has saved all of you he means to save; sometimes, I
          am afraid he has; and then it will be of little use for me to keep on
          preaching to you, and I had better shift quarters and try somewhere
          else. It would be a melancholy thought if I believed it: -- I do not
          believe it, I only fear it. Surely it is not always to be true that
          strangers, who drop in here only once, are converted, and you who are
          always hearing the gospel remain unaffected. Strange, but may it not
          be strangely, lamentably true of you? This very day may the anxiety of
          your Christian friends be excited for you, and then may you be led to
          be anxious for yourselves, and give your eyes no slumber till you find
          the Saviour. You know the way of salvation; it is simply to come with
          your sins and rest them on the Saviour; it is to rely upon or trust in
          the atoning blood. Oh that you may be made to trust this morning, to
          the praise of the glory of his grace. The elders mean to meet together
          tomorrow evening to have a special hour of prayer; I hope, also, the
          mothers will meet and have a time wrestling, and that every member of
          the church will try to set apart a time for supplication this week,
          that the Lord may visit again his church, and cause us to rejoice in
          his name. We cannot go back; we dare not go back. We have put our hand
          to the plough, and the curse will be upon us if we turn back. Remember
          Lot's wife. It must be onward with us; backward it cannot be. In the
          name of God the Eternal, let us gird up our loins by the power of his
          Spirit, and go onward conquering through the blood of the Lamb. We ask
          it for Jesus' sake. Amen.

        <p>PORTIONS OF SCRIPTURE READ BEFORE SERMON -- Isaiah 66.</p>
        <p>
          Of this sermon, a copy was sent to every Baptist and Congregational
          minister in Great Britain, and several letters have been received,
          acknowledging the quickening thereby received. May the like result be
          far more abundant in the New World.<br />
