          |But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.| -- Matthew 10:30.
        </p>
        <p>
          DURING THIS WEEK my mind has been much directed to the subject of
          Providence,and you will not wonder when I relate a portion of one
          day's story. I was engaged to preach last Wednesday at Halifax, where
          there was a heavy snow storm. Preparations had been made for a
          congregation of 8000 persons, and a huge wooden structure had been
          erected. I considered that owing to the severe weather, few persons
          could possibly assemble, and I looked forward to the dreary task of
          addressing an insignificant handful of people in a vast place.
          However, when I arrived, I found from 5000 to 6000 people gathered
          together to hear the Word; and a more substantial looking place it has
          not been my lot to see. It certainly was a huge uncomely building,
          but, nevertheless, it seemed well adapted to answer the purpose. We
          met together in the afternoon and worshipped God, and again in the
          evening, and we separated to our homes, or rather, we were about to
          separate, and all this while the kind providence of God was watching
          over us. Immediately in front of me there was a huge gallery, which
          looked an exceedingly massive structure, capable of holding 2000
          persons. This, in the afternoon, was crowded, and it seemed to stand
          as firm as a rock. Again in the evening there it stood, and neither
          moved nor shook. But mark the provident hand of God: in the evening,
          when the people were about to retire, and when there was scarcely more
          than a hundred persons there, a huge beam gave way, and down came a
          portion of the flooring of the gallery with a fearful crash. Several
          persons were precipitated with the planks, but still the good hand of
          God watched over us, and only two persons were severely injured with
          broken legs, which it is trusted will be re-set without the necessity
          of amputation. Now, had this happened any earlier, not only must many
          more have been injured, but there are a thousand chances to one, as we
          say, that a panic must necessarily have ensued similar to that which
          we still remember, and deplore as having occurred in this place. Had
          such a thing occurred, and had I been the unhappy preacher on the
          occasion, I feel certain that I should never have been able to occupy
          the pulpit again. Such was the effect of the first calamity, that I
          marvel that I ever survived. No human tongue can possibly tell what I
          experienced. The Lord, however, graciously preserved us; the fewness
          of the people in the gallery prevented any such catastrophe, and thus
          a most fearful accident was averted. But we have a more marvellous
          providence still to record. Overloaded by the immense weight of snow
          which fell upon it, and beaten by a heavy wind, the entire building
          fell with an enormous crash three hours after we had left it,
          splitting the huge timbers into shivers, and rendering very much of
          the material utterly useless for any future building. Now mark this --
          had the snow begun three hours earlier, the building must have fallen
          upon us, and how few of us would have escaped we cannot guess. But
          mark another thing. All day long it thawed so fast, that the snow as
          it fell seemed to leave a mass, not of white snow, but of snow and
          water together. This ran through the roof upon us, to our considerable
          annoyance, and I was almost ready to complain that we had hard dealing
          from God's providence. But if it had been a frost instead of a thaw,
          you can easily perceive that the place must have fallen several hours
          beforehand, and then your minister, and the greater part of his
          congregation, would probably have been in the other world. Some there
          may be who deny providence altogether. I cannot conceive that there
          were any partakers of the scene who could have done so. This I know,
          if I had been an unbeliever to this day in the doctrine of the
          supervision and wise care of God, I must have been a believer in it at
          this hour. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name
          together; he hath been very gracious unto us, and remembered us for
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, when we look abroad into the world we see, as we think, such
          abundant proofs that there is a God, that we are apt to treat a man
          who denies the existence of a God with very little respect or
          patience. We believe him to be wilfully blind, for we see God's name
          so legible upon the very surface of creation, that we cannot have
          patience with him if he dares to deny the existence of a Creator. And
          in the matter of salvation: we have each of us seen in our own
          salvation such positive marks of the Lord's dealings with us, that we
          are apt to be somewhat censorious and harsh towards any who propound a
          doctrine which would teach salvation apart from God. And I think we
          shall be very apt this morning to think hardly of the man, who, having
          seen and heard of such a providence as that which I have just related,
          could fail to see God's hand. It seems to me that the hand of God in
          providence is as clear as in creation; and whilst I am sure that if
          saved at all I must be saved by God, I feel equally certain that every
          matter which concerns all of us in daily life, bears upon itself the
          evident trace of being the handiwork of Jehovah, our God. We must, if
          we would be true believers in God, and would avoid all atheism, give
          unto him the kingship in the three kingdoms of creation, grace, and
          providence. It is in the last, however, that I think we are the most
          apt to forget him; we may easily see God in creation if we be at all
          enlightened, and if saved, we cannot avoid confessing that salvation
          is of the Lord alone. The very way in which we are saved, and the
          effect of grace in our hearts, always compels us to feel that God is
          just. But providence is such a chequered thing, and you and I are so
          prone to misjudge God and to come to rash conclusions concerning his
          dealings with us, that perhaps this is the greatest stronghold of our
          natural Atheism -- a doubt of God's dealings with us in the
          arrangements of outward affairs. This morning I shall not be able to
          go deeply into the subject, but very heartily can I enter into it,
          after being so great a partaker of his wonder-working power.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the text I shall draw one or two points. First of all, the text
          says, |the very hairs of our head are all numbered.| From this I shall
          infer the minuteness of providence. Again, inasmuch as it is said of
          believers that the hairs of their head are all numbered, I shall infer
          the kind consideration, the generous care, which God exercises over
          Christians. And then, from the text, and from our Saviour's reason for
          uttering these words, I shall draw a practical conclusion of what
          should be the spirit and temper of the men who believe this truth --
          that the very hairs of their head are all numbered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, our text very clearly teaches us THE MINUTENESS OF
          PROVIDENCE. Every man can see providence in great things; it is very
          seldom that you find any person denying that when an avalanche falls
          from the summit of the Alps, the hand, the terrible hand of God is
          there. There are very few men who do not feel that God is present in
          the whirlwind, and in the storm. Most men will acknowledge that the
          earthquake, the hurricane, the devastation of war, and the ravages of
          pestilence, come from the hand of God. We find most men very willing
          to confess that God is God of the hills, but they forget that he is
          also Lord of the valleys. They will grant that he deals with great
          masses, but not with individuals; with seas in the bulk, but not with
          drops. Most men forget, however, that the fact which they believe of
          providence being in great things involves a providence in the little,
          for it were an inconsistent belief that the mass were in God's hand,
          whilst the atom was left to chance; it is indeed a belief that
          contradicts itself; we must believe all chance or else all God. We
          must have all ordained and arranged, or else we must have everything
          left to the wild whirlwind of chance and accident. But I believe that
          it is in little things that we fail to see God; therefore, it is to
          the little things that I call your attention this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe my text means literally what it says. |The very hairs of
          your head are all numbered.| God's wisdom and knowledge are so great,
          that he even knows the number of the hairs upon our head. His
          providence descends to the minute particles of dust in the summer
          gale; he numbers the gnats in the sunshine, and the fishes in the sea.
          While it certainly doth control the massive orbs that shine in heaven,
          it doth not blush to deal with the drop that trickleth from the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I shall want you to notice, how little circumstances of daily
          life, when we come to put them all together, evidently betray their
          origin. I will take a Scripture history, and show how the little
          events must have been of God, as well as the great results. When
          Joseph was sent into Egypt by his brethren, in order to provide for
          them against a day of famine, we all agree with Joseph's declaration,
          |It was God that sent me hither.| But now, if we notice each of the
          little ways through which this great result was brought to pass, we
          shall see God in each of them. One day, Joseph's brethren are gone out
          with the sheep; Jacob wants to send to them. Why does he send Joseph?
          He was his darling son; he loved him better than all his brethren. Why
          does he send him away? He sends him, however. Then why should it have
          happened at that particular time, that Jacob should want to send at
          all? However, he did want to send, and he did send Joseph. A mere
          accident you will say, but quite necessary as the basement of the
          structure. Joseph goes; his brethren are in want of pasture, and
          therefore leave Shechem, where Joseph expected to find them, and
          journey on to Dothan. Why go to Dothan? Was not the whole land before
          them? However Joseph goes there; he arrives at Dothan just when they
          are thinking of him and his dreams, and they put him into a pit. As
          they are about to eat bread, some Ishmaelites came by. Why did they
          come there at all? Why did they come at that particular time? Why were
          they going to Egypt? Why might they not have been going any other way?
          Why was it that the Ishmaelites wanted to buy slaves? Why might they
          not have been trading in some other commodity? However, Joseph is
          sold; but he is not disposed of on the road to Egypt, he is taken to
          the land. Why is it that Potiphar is to buy him? Why is it that
          Potiphar has a wife, at all? Why is it again that Potiphar's wife
          should be so full of lust? Why should Joseph get into prison? How is
          it that the baker and the butler should offend their master? All
          chance, as the world has it, but every link necessary to make the
          chain. They do both offend their master; they are both put into
          prison. How is it that they both dream? How is it that Joseph
          interprets the dreams? How is it that the butler forgets him? Why,
          just because if he had recollected him, it would have spoiled it all.
          Why is it Pharaoh dreams? How can dreams be under the arrangement of
          God's providence? However, Pharaoh does dream; the butler then thinks
          of Joseph; Joseph is brought out of prison and taken before Pharaoh.
          But take away any of those simple circumstances, break any one of the
          links of the chain, and the whole of the design is scattered to the
          winds. You cannot get the machine to work; if any of the minute cogs
          of the wheels are taken away, everything is disarranged. I think it
          seems very clear to any man who will dissect not only that, but any
          other history he likes to fix upon, that there must be a God in the
          little accidents and dealings of daily life, as well as in the great
          results that tell upon the page of history, and are recounted in our
          songs. God is to be seen in little things.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will now notice, in the minutiae of providence, how punctual
          providence always is. You will never wonder more at providence, than
          when you consider how well God keeps time with himself. To return to
          our history -- how is it that the Ishmaelites should come by just at
          that time? How many thousand chances there were that their journey
          might have been taken just before! There certainly was no special
          train to call at that station at that particular time, so that
          Joseph's brethren might arrange to go and call him. No such thing. And
          yet if there had been all this arrangement, it could not have happened
          better. You know Reuben intended to fetch Joseph out of the pit half
          an hour later, and |the child was not.| God had these Ishmaelites
          ready: you do not know how he may have sped them on their journey, or
          delayed them, so as to bring them on the spot punctually at the
          identical moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give another instance, there was a poor woman whose son had been
          raised from the dead by Elisha; she, however, had left her country at
          the time of famine, and had lost her estate. She wanted to get it
          back; God determined that she should have it. How was it to be done?
          The king sends for Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, and he talks to him:
          he tells him one instance about a woman who had had a child raised
          from the dead. How strange! in comes the woman herself. My lord, this
          is the woman; she comes to obtain her suit. Her desire is granted,
          just because at the very moment the king's mind is interested
          concerning her. All chance, was it not? Nothing but chance? So fools
          say; but those who read Bibles, and those who have judgment, say there
          is something more than chance in such a coalition of circumstances. It
          could not be a mere coincidence, as men sometimes say; there must be
          God here, for it is harder to think that there is not God than that
          there is. And whilst a belief in God may be said by some to involve a
          great stretch of faith, the putting him out of such things as this,
          would involve an infinitely greater amount of credulity. No, there was
          God there.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another instance that I remember in the New Testament
          history. Paul goes into the temple, and the Jews rush upon him in a
          moment to kill him. They drag him out of the temple, and the doors are
          shut against him. They are just in the very act of killing him, and
          what is to become of poor Paul's life? Five minutes longer and Paul
          will be dead, when up comes the chief captain and delivers him. How
          was it that the chief captain knew of it? Very probably some young man
          of the crowd who knew Paul and loved him, ran to tell him. But why was
          it that the chief captain was at home? How was it that the ruler was
          able to come on a moment's emergency? How was it that he did come at
          all? It was only just a Hebrew, a man that was good for nothing, being
          killed. How was it that he came, and when he came the streets were
          full; there was a mob about Jerusalem? How did he come to the right
          street? How did he come at the exact nick of time? Say, |It is all
          chance!| I laugh at you; it is providence. If there be anything in the
          world that is plain to any man that thinks, it is plain that God
        </p>
        <p>|Overrules all mortal things,</p>
        <p>And manages our mean affairs.|</p>
        <p>
          But mark, that the running of the youth, and his arrival at the
          precise time, and the coming of the chief governor at the precise
          time, just proved the punctuality of Divine providence; and if God has
          a design that a thing shall happen at twelve, if you have appointed it
          for eleven, it shall not happen till twelve; and if he means it to be
          delayed till one, it is in vain that you propose any earlier or any
          later. God's punctuality in providence is always sure, and very often
          apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is it only in the minutes of time that we get an idea of the
          minuteness of providence, but it is in the use of little things. A
          sparrow has turned the fate of an empire. You remember the old story
          of Mohammed flying from his pursuers. He enters a cave, and a sparrow
          chirps at the entrance, and flies away as the pursuers pass. |Oh,| say
          they, |there is no fear that Mohammed is there, otherwise the bird
          would have gone a long while ago;| and the imposter's life is saved by
          a sparrow. We think, perhaps, that God directs the motions of the
          leviathan, and guides him in the sea, when he makes the deep to be
          hoary. Will we please to recollect, that the guidance of a minnow in
          its tiny pool, is as much in the hand of providence as the motion of
          the great serpent in the depths. You see the birds congregate in the
          autumn, ready for their flight across the purple sea. They fly hither
          and thither in strange confusion. The believer in providence holds
          that the wing of every bird has stamped upon it the place where it
          shall fly, and fly with never such vagaries of its own wild will, it
          cannot diverge so much as the millionth part of an inch from its
          predestinated track. It may whirl about, above, beneath, -- east,
          west, north, south -- wherever it pleases; still, it is all according
          to the providential hand of God. And although we see it not, it may
          be, that if that swallow did not take the precise track which it does
          take, something a little greater might be affected thereby; and again,
          something a little greater still might be affected, until at last a
          great thing would be involved in a little. Blessed is that man who
          seeth God in trifles! It is there that it is the hardest to see him;
          but he who believes that God is there, may go from the little
          providence up to the God of providence. Rest assured, when the fish in
          the sea take their migration, they have a captain and a leader, as
          well as the stars; for he who marshals the stars in their courses, and
          guides the planets in their march, is the master of the fly, and wings
          the bat, and guides the minnow, and doth not despise the tiniest of
          his creatures. You say there is predestination in the path of the
          earth; you believe that in the shining of the sun there is the
          ordinance of God; there is as much his ordinance in the creeping of an
          insect or in the glimmering of a glow-worm in the darkness. In nothing
          is there chance, but in everything there is a God. All things live and
          move in him, and have their being; nor could they live or move
          otherwise; for God hath so ordained them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hear one say, |Well, sir, you seem to be a fatalist!| No, far from
          it. There is just this difference between fate and providence. Fate is
          blind; providence has eyes. Fate is blind, a thing that must be; it is
          just an arrow shot from a bow, that must fly onward, but hath no
          target. Not so, providence; providence is full of eyes. There is a
          design in everything, and an end to be answered; all things are
          working together, and working together for good. They are not done
          because they must be done, but they are done because there is some
          reason for it. It is not only that the thing is, because it must be;
          but the thing is, because it is right it should be. God hath not
          arbitrarily marked out the world's history; he had an eye to the great
          architecture of perfection, when he marked all the aisles of history,
          and placed all the pillars of events in the building of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another thing that we have to recollect also, which will
          strike us perhaps more than the smallness of things. The minuteness of
          providence may be seen in the fact, that even the thoughts of men are
          under God's hand. Now, thoughts are things which generally escape our
          attention, when we speak of providence. But how much may depend upon a
          thought! Oftentimes a monarch has had a thought which has cost a
          nation many a bloody battle. Sometimes a good man has had a thought,
          which has been the means of rescuing multitudes from hell, and bearing
          thousands safely to heaven. Beyond a doubt, every imagination, every
          passing thought, every conception, that is only born to die, is under
          the hand of God. And in turning over the page of history, you will
          often be struck, when you see how great a thing has been brought about
          by an idle word. Depend upon it, then, that the will of man, the
          thought of man, the desire of man, that every purpose of man, is
          immediately under the hand of God. Take an instance -- Jesus Christ is
          to be born at Bethlehem; his mother is living at Nazareth: he will be
          born there to a dead certainty. No, not so. Caesar takes a whim into
          his head. All the world shall be taxed, and he will have all of them
          go to their own city. What necessity for that? Stupid idea of
          Caesar's! If he had had a parliament, they would have voted against
          him. They would have said, |Why make all the people go to their own
          peculiar city to the census? Take the census where they live; that
          will be abundantly sufficient.| |No,| says he, |it is my will, and
          Caesar cannot be opposed.| Some think Caesar mad. God knows what he
          means to do with Caesar. Mary, great with child, must take a laborious
          journey to Bethlehem; and there is her child born in a manger. We
          should not have had the prophecy fulfilled, that Christ should be born
          at Bethlehem, and our very faith in the Messiah might have been
          shaken, if it had not been for that whim of Caesar's. So that even the
          will of man; the tyranny, the despotism of the tyrant, is in the hand
          of God, and he turneth it whithersoever he pleaseth, to work his own
          will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gathering up all our heads into one short statement, it is our firm
          belief that he who wings an angel guides a sparrow. We believe that he
          who supports the dignity of his throne amidst the splendors of heaven
          maintains it also in the depths of the dark sea. We believe that there
          is nothing above, beneath, around, which is not according to the
          determination of his own counsel and will; and while we are not
          fatalists, we do most truly and sternly hold the doctrine, that God
          hath decreed all things whatsoever that come to pass, and that he
          overruleth all things for his own glory and good; so that with Martin
          Luther, we can say,
        </p>
        <p>|He everywhere hath sway,</p>
        <p>And all things serve his might;</p>
        <p>His every act pure blessing is,</p>
        <p>His path unsullied light.|</p>
        <p>
          II. The second point is, THE KIND CONSIDERATION OF GOD, IN TAKING CARE
          OF HIS PEOPLE. In reading the text, I thought, |There is better care
          taken of me than I can take care of myself.| You all take care of
          yourselves to some extent, but which of you ever took so much care of
          himself as to count the hairs of his head? But God will not only
          protect our limbs, but even the excrescence of hair is to be seen
          after. And how much this excels all the care of our tenderest friends!
          Look at the mother, how careful she is. If her child has a little
          cough, she notices it: the slightest weakness is sure to be observed.
          She has watched all its motions anxiously, to see whether it walked
          right, whether all its limbs were sound, and whether it had the use of
          all its powers in perfection; but she has never thought of numbering
          the hairs of her child's head, and the absence of one or two of them
          would give her no great concern. But our God is more careful of us,
          even than a mother with her child -- so careful that he numbers the
          hairs of our head. How safe are we, then, beneath the hand of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          However, leaving the figure, let us again notice the kind, guardian
          care, which God exerts over his people in the way of providence. I
          have often been struck with the providence of God, in keeping his
          people alive before they were converted. How many are there here who
          would have been in hell at this hour, if some special providence had
          not kept them alive till the time of their conversion! I remember
          mentioning this in company, and almost every person in the room had
          some half-miracle to tell, concerning his own deliverance before
          conversion. One gentleman, I remember, was a sporting man, who
          afterwards became an eminent Christian. He told me, that a little time
          before his conversion he was shooting, and his gun burst in four
          pieces, which stood upright in the earth as near as possible in the
          exact form of a square, having been driven nearly a foot into the
          ground, while he stood there unharmed and quite safe, having scarcely
          felt the shock. I was noticing in Hervey's works, one day, a very
          pretty thought on this subject. He says, |Two persons who had been
          hunting together in the day, slept together the following night. One
          of them was renewing the pursuit in his dream, and, having run the
          whole circle of the chase, came at last to the fall of the stag; upon
          this he cries out with a determined ardor, I'll kill him, I'll kill
          him; and immediately feels for the knife which he carried in his
          pocket. His companion happening to awake, and observing what passed,
          leaped from the bed. Being secure from danger, and the moon shining in
          the room, he stood to view the event, when, to his inexpressible
          surprise, the infatuated sportsman gave several deadly stabs in the
          very place where a moment before the throat and the life of his friend
          lay. -- This I mention, as a proof, that nothing hinders us, even from
          being assassins of others, or murderers of ourselves, amidst the mad
          sallies of sleep, only the preventing care of our Heavenly Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          How wonderful the providence of God with regard to Christian people,
          in keeping them out of temptation. I have often noticed this fact, and
          I believe you are able to confirm it, that there are times when if a
          temptation should come you would be overtaken by it; but the
          temptation does not come. And at other times, when the temptation
          comes, you have supernatural strength to resist it. Yes! the best
          Christian in the world will tell you, that such is still the strength
          of his lust, that there are moments when if the object were presented
          to him, he would certainly fall into the commission of a foul sin; but
          then the object is not there, or there is no opportunity of committing
          the sin. At another time, when we are called to go through a burning
          fiery furnace of temptation, we have no desire towards the peculiar
          sin, in fact we feel an aversion to it, or are even incapable of it.
          Strange it is, but many a man's character has been saved by
          providence. The best man that ever lived, little knows how much he
          owes for preservation to the providence as well as to the grace of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          How marvellously too has providence arranged all our places. I cannot
          but recur to my own personal history, for, after all, we are obliged
          to speak more of what we know of ourselves as matters of fact than of
          others. I shall always regard the fact of my being here to-day as a
          remarkable instance of providence. I should not have occupied this
          hall probably, and been blessed of God in preaching to multitudes if
          it had not been for what I considered an untoward accident. I should
          have been at this time studying in College, instead of preaching here,
          but for a singular circumstance which happened. I had agreed to go to
          College: the tutor had come to see me, and I went to see him at the
          house of a mutual friend; I was shown by the servant into one
          drawing-room in the house, he was shown into another. He sat and
          waited for me for two hours; I sat and waited for him two hours. He
          could wait no longer, and went away thinking I had not treated him
          well; I went away and thought that he had not treated me well. As I
          went away this text came into my mind, |Seekest thou great things for
          thyself? Seek them not.| So I wrote to say that I must positively
          decline, I was happy enough amongst my own country people, and got on
          very well in preaching, and I did not care to go to College. I have
          now had four years of labor. But, speaking after the manner of men,
          those who have been saved during that time would not have been saved,
          by my instrumentality at any rate, if it had not been for the
          remarkable providence turning the whole tenour of my thoughts, and
          putting things into a new track. You have often had strange accidents
          like that. When you have resolved to do a thing, you could not do it
          any how; it was quite impossible. God turned you another way, and
          proved that providence is indeed the master of all human events.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how good, too, has God been in providence to some of you, in
          providing your daily bread. It is remarkable how a little poverty
          makes a person believe in providence, especially if he is helped
          through it. If a person has to live from hand to mouth, when day by
          day the manna falls, he begins to think there is a providence then.
          The gentleman who sows his broad acres, reaps his wheat and puts it
          into his barn, or takes his regular income, gets on so nicely that he
          can do without providence; he does not care a bit about it. The rents
          of his houses all come in, and his money in the Three per Cents is
          quite safe -- what does he want with providence? But the poor man who
          has to work at day labor, and sometimes runs very short, and just then
          happens to meet with somebody who gives him precisely what he wants,
          he exclaims, |Well, I know there is a providence -- I cannot help
          believing it; these things could not have come by chance.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in conclusion, brethren and sisters, if these things be
          so, if the hairs of our head are all numbered, and if providence
          provides for his people all things necessary for this life, and
          godliness, and arranges everything with infinite and unerring wisdom,
          what manner of persons ought we to be?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, we ought to be a bold race of people. What have we
          to fear? Another man looks up, and if he sees a lightning-flash, he
          trembles at its mysterious power. We believe it has its predestined
          path. We may stand and contemplate it; although we would not
          presumptuously expose ourselves to it, yet can we confide in our God
          in the midst of the storm. We are out at sea, the waves are dashing
          against the ship, she reels to and fro; other men shake, because they
          think this is all chance; we, however, see an order in the waves, and
          hear a music in the winds. It is for us to be peaceful and calm. To
          other men the tempest is a fearful thing; we believe that the tempest
          is in the hand of God. Why should we shake? Why should we quiver? In
          all convulsions of the world, in all temporal distress and danger, it
          is for us to stand calm and collected, looking boldly on. Our
          confidence should be very much the same, in comparison with the man
          who is not a believer in providence, as the confidence of some learned
          surgeon, who, when he is going through an operation, sees something
          very marvellous, but yet never shudders at it, while the ignorant
          peasant, who has never seen any thing so wonderful, is alarmed and
          fearful, and even thinks that evil spirits are at work. We are to say
          -- let others say what they please -- |I know God is here, and I am
          his child, and this is all working for my good; therefore will not I
          fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried
          into the midst of the sea.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially may I address this remark to timid people. There are some
          of you who are frightened at every little thing. Oh! if you could but
          believe that God manages all, why, you would not be screaming because
          your husband is not home when there is a little thunder and lightning,
          or because there is a mouse in the parlour, or because there is a
          great tree blown down in the garden. There is no necessity you should
          believe that your brother-in-law, who has gone to Australia was
          wrecked, because there was a storm when he was at sea. There is no
          need for you to imagine, that your son in the army was necessarily
          killed, because he happened to be before Lucknow; or, if you think the
          thing necessary, still, as a believer in God's providence, you should
          just stand and say that God has done it, and it is yours to resign all
          things into his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may say to those of you also who have been bereaved -- if you
          believe in providence you may grieve; but your grief must not be
          excessive. I remember at a funeral of a friend hearing a pretty
          parable which I have told before, and will tell again. There was much
          weeping on account of the loss of a loved one, and the minister put it
          thus. He said, |Suppose you are a gardener employed by another; it is
          not your garden, but you are called upon to tend it, and you have your
          wages paid you. You have taken great care with a certain number of
          roses; you have trained them up, and there they are, blooming in their
          beauty. You pride yourself upon them. You come one morning into the
          garden, and you find that the best rose has been taken away. You are
          angry: you go to your fellow-servants, and charge them with having
          taken the rose. They will declare that they had nothing at all to do
          with it; and one says, |I saw the master walking here this morning; I
          think he took it.| Is the gardener angry then? No, at once he says, |I
          am happy that my rose should have been so fair as to attract the
          attention of the master. It is his own: he hath taken it; let him do
          what seemeth him good.|
        </p>
        <p>
          It is even so with your friends. They wither not by chance; the grave
          is not filled by accident; men die according to God's will. Your child
          is gone, but the Master took it; your husband is gone, your wife is
          buried, -- the Master took them; thank him that he let you have the
          pleasure of caring for them and tending them while they were here, and
          thank him that as he gave, he himself has taken away. If others had
          done it, you would have had cause to be angry; but the Lord has done
          it. Can you, then, murmur? Will you not say --
        </p>
        <p>|Thee at all times will I bless;</p>
        <p>Having thee I all possess;</p>
        <p>How can I bereaved be,</p>
        <p>Since I cannot part with thee.|</p>
        <p>
          And pardon me when I say, finally, that I think this doctrine, if
          fully believed, ought to keep us always in an equable frame of mind.
          One of the things we most want is, to have our equilibrium always kept
          up. Sometimes we are elated. If I ever find myself elated I know what
          is coming. I know that I shall be depressed in a very few hours. If
          the balance goes too much up, it is sure to come down again. The
          happiest state of mind is to be always on the equilibrium. If good
          things come, thank God for them; but do not set your heart upon them.
          If good things go, thank God that he has taken them himself, and still
          bless his name. Bear all. He who feels that everything cometh to pass
          according to God's will, hath a great main-stay to his soul. He need
          not be shaken to and fro by every wind that bloweth; for he is fast
          bound, so that he need not move. This is an anchor cast into the sea.
          While the other ships are drifting far away, he can ride calmly
          through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strive, dear friends, to believe this, and maintain as the consequence
          of it, that continual calm and peace which renders life so happy. Do
          not get fearing ills that may come to-morrow; either they will not
          come, or else they will bring good with them. If you have evils
          to-day, do not multiply them by fearing those of to-morrow.
          |Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.| Oh, I would to God,
          that some of you who are full of carking care and anxiety, could be
          delivered from it by a belief in providence; and when you once get
          into that quiet frame, which this doctrine engenders, you will be
          prepared for those higher exercises of communion and fellowship with
          Christ, to which distracting care is ever a fearful detriment, if not
          an entire preventive.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as for you who fear not God, remember, the stones of the field are
          in league against you; the heavens cry to the earth and the earth
          answereth to the heavens, for vengeance upon you on account of your
          sins. For you there is nothing good, everything is in rebellion
          against you. Oh that God might bring you into peace with him, and then
          you would be at rest with all beside. |Seek first the kingdom of God
          and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.|
          The Lord bless you in this, for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
