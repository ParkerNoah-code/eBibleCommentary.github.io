        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.46)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 14, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |Lord thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.| -- Psalm
          90:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses was the inspired author of three devotional compositions. We
          first of all find him as Moses the poet, singing the song which is
          aptly joined with that of Jesus, in the Revelation, where it says,
          |The song of Moses and of the Lamb.| He was a poet on the occasion
          when Pharaoh and his hosts were cast into the Red Sea, |his chosen
          captains also were drowned in the Red Sea.| Further on in his life we
          discover him in the character of a preacher; and then his doctrine
          distilled as the dew, and his speech dropped like the rain, in those
          chapters which are full of glorious imagery, and rich with poetry,
          which you will find in the book of Deuteronomy. And now in the Psalms,
          we find him the author of a prayer: |A prayer of Moses, the man of
          God.| Happy combination of the poet, the preacher, and the man of
          prayer! Where three such things are found together, the man becomes a
          very giant above his fellows. It often happens that the man who
          preaches has but little poetry; and the man who is the poet would not
          be able to preach and utter his poems before immense assemblies, but
          would be only fit to write them by himself. It is a rare combination
          when true devotion and the spirit of poetry and eloquence meet in the
          same man. You will see in this Psalm a wondrous depth of spirituality;
          you will mark how the poet subsides into the man of God; and how, lost
          in himself, he sings his own frailty, declared the glory of God, and
          asks that he may have the blessing of his heavenly Father always
          resting on his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          This first verse will derive peculiar interest if you remember the
          place where Moses was when he thus prayed. He was in the wilderness;
          not in some of the halls of Pharaoh, nor yet in a habitation in the
          land of Goshen; but in a wilderness. And perhaps from the summit of
          the hill, looking upon the tribes of Israel as they were taking up
          their tents and marching along, he thought, |Ah! poor travelers. They
          seldom rest anywhere; they have not any settled habitation where they
          can dwell. Here they have no continuing city;| but he lifted his eyes
          above, and he said, |Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all
          generations.| Passing his eye back through history, he saw one great
          temple where God's people had dwelt; and with his prophetical eye
          rolling with sacred frenzy, he could see that throughout all futurity
          the specially chosen of God would be able to sing, |Lord, thou hast
          been our dwelling-place in all generations.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking this verse as the subject of our discourse this morning, we
          shall, first of all, explain it; and then we shall try and do what the
          old Puritans called |improve| it; by which they did not mean improve
          the text, but improve the people a little in the consideration of the
          verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we will try to explain it somewhat. Here is a habitation:
          |Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place;| and, secondly, if I may use
          such a common word, here is the lease of it: |Thou hast been our
          dwelling-place in all generations.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then here is a habitation: |Lord, thou hast been our
          habitation.| The mighty Jehovah, who filleth all immensity, the
          Eternal, Everlasting, Great I Am, does not refuse to allow figures
          concerning himself. Though he is so high that the eye of angel hath
          not seen him, though he is so lofty that the wing of cherub hath not
          reached him, though he is so great that the utmost extent of the
          travels of immortal spirits have never discovered the limit of himself
          -- yet he does not object that his people should speak of him thus
          familiarly, and should say, |Jehovah, thou hast been our
          dwelling-place.| We shall understand this figure better by contrasting
          the thought, with the state of Israel in the wilderness; and,
          secondly, by making mention of some things by way of comparison, which
          are peculiar to our house, and which we never can enjoy if we are not
          the possessors of a dwelling-place of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we shall contrast this thought, |Lord, thou hast been our
          dwelling-place,| with the peculiar position of the Israelites as they
          were traveling through the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We remark, first, that they must have been in a state of great
          uneasiness. At nightfall, or when the pillar stayed its motion, the
          tents were pitched, and they laid themselves down to rest. Perhaps
          to-morrow, ere the morning sun had risen, the trumpet sounded, they
          stirred themselves from their beds and found the ark was in motion,
          and the fiery cloudy pillar was leading the way through the narrow
          defiles of the mountain up the hillside, or along the arid waste of
          the wilderness. They had scarcely time to arrange their little
          property in their tents and make all things comfortable for
          themselves, before they heard the sound of |Away! away! away! this is
          not your rest; you must still be onward journeying toward Cannan!|
          They could not plant a little patch of ground around their tents, they
          could not lay out their house in order, and arrange their furniture,
          they could not become attached to the spot of ground. Even though just
          now their father had been buried in a place where a tent had tarried
          for a time yet they must be off. They must have no attachment to the
          place, they must have nothing of what we call comfort, ease, and
          peace; but be always journeying, always traveling. Moreover, so
          exposed were they, that they never could be very easy in their tents.
          At one time the sand, with the hot simoom behind it, would drive
          through the tent and cover them almost to burial. On frequent
          occasions the hot sun would scorch them, and their canvas would scarce
          be a preservation; at another time the biting north wind would freeze
          around them, so that within their tents they sat shivering and
          cowering around their fires. They had little ease; but behold the
          contrast which Moses, the man of God, discerns with gratitude, |Thou
          art not our tent, but thou art our dwelling-place. Though we are
          uneasy here, though we are tossed from side to side by troubles,
          though we travel through a wilderness, and find it a rough pathway,
          though when we sit down here we know not what comfort means, O Lord,
          in thee we possess all the comfort which a house can afford, we have
          all that a mansion or palace can give the prince, who can loll upon
          his couch, and rest upon his bed of down. Lord, thou art to us
          comfort, thou art a house and habitation.| Have you ever known what it
          is to have God for your dwelling-place in the sense of comfort? Do you
          know what it is, when you have storms behind you, to feel like a
          sea-bird, blown to the land by the very storm? Do you know what it is,
          when you have been caged sometimes by adversity, to have the string
          cut by divine grace, and like the pigeon that flies at once to its own
          dovecot, have you sped your way across the ether, and found yourself
          in God? Do you know what it is, when you are tossed on the waves, to
          do down into the depths of Godhead, there rejoicing that not a wave of
          trouble ruffles your spirit, but that you are serenely at home with
          God your own Almighty Father? Can you, amid all the uneasiness of this
          desert journey, find a comfort there? Is the breast of Jesus a sweet
          pillow for your head? Can you, lie thus on the breast of Deity? Can
          you put yourself in the stream of Providence and float along without a
          struggle, while angels sing around you -- divinely guided, divinely
          led -- |We are bearing thee along the stream of Providence to the
          ocean of eternal bliss!| Do you know what it is to lie on God, to give
          up all care, to drive anxiety away, and there -- not in a recklessness
          of spirit, but in a holy carelessness -- to be careful for nothing,
          |but in every thing by supplication to make known your wants unto
          God?| If so you have gained the first idea; |Lord, thou hast been our
          dwelling-place throughout all generations.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Israelites were very much exposed to all kinds of noxious
          creatures, owing to their residing in tents, and their habits of
          wandering. At one time the fiery serpent was their foe. By night the
          wild beasts prowled around them. Unless that fiery pillar had been a
          wall of fire around them and glory in the midst, they might all have
          fallen a prey to the wild monsters that roamed the deserts. Worse foes
          they found in human kind. The Amalekites rushed down from the
          mountains; wild wandering hordes constantly attacked them. They never
          felt themselves secure, for they were travelers through an enemy's
          country. They were hasting across a land where they were not wanted,
          to another land that was providing means to oppose them when they
          should arrive. Such is the Christian. He is journeying through an
          enemy's land; every day he is exposed to danger. His tent may be
          broken down by death; the slanderer is behind him, the open foeman is
          before him; the wild beast that prowls by night, and the pestilence
          that wasteth by day, continually seek his destruction; he finds no
          rest where he is; he feels himself exposed. But, says Moses, |Though
          we live in a tent exposed to wild beasts and fierce men, yet thou art
          our habitation. In thee we find no exposure. Within thee we find
          ourselves secure, and in thy glorious person we dwell as in an
          impregnable tower of defense, safe from every fear and alarm, knowing
          that we are secure.| O Christian, hast thou ever known what it is to
          stand in the midst of battles, with arrows flying thick around thee
          more than thy shield can catch; and yet thou hast been as secure as if
          thou wert folding thine arms and resting within the walls of some
          strong bastion, where arrow could not reach thee, and where even the
          sound of trumpet could not disturb thine ears? Hast thou known what it
          is to dwell securely in God, to enter into the Most High, and laugh to
          scorn the anger, the frowns, the sneers, the contempt, the slander and
          calumny of men; to ascent into the sacred place of the pavilion of the
          Most High, and to abide under the shadow of the Almighty, and to feel
          thyself secure? And mark thee, thou mayest do this. In times of
          pestilence it is possible to walk in the midst of cholera and death,
          singing --
        </p>
        <p>|Plagues and deaths around me fly,</p>
        <p>Till he please, I cannot die.|</p>
        <p>
          It is possible to stand exposed to the utmost degree of danger, and
          yet to feel such a holy serenity that we can laugh at fear; too great,
          too mighty, too powerful through God to stoop for one moment to the
          cowardice of trembling, |we know whom we have believed, and we are
          persuaded that he is able to keep that which we have committed unto
          him.| When houseless men wander, when poor distressed spirits, beaten
          by the storm, find no refuge, we enter into God, and shutting behind
          us the door of faith, we say, |Howl, ye winds; blow, ye tempests;
          roar, ye wild beasts; come on, ye robbers!|
        </p>
        <p>|He that hath made his refuge God,</p>
        <p>Shall find a most secure abode,</p>
        <p>Shall walk all day beneath his shade,</p>
        <p>And there at night shall rest his head.|</p>
        <p>Lord, in this sense, thou hast been our habitation.</p>
        <p>
          Again, poor Israel, in the wilderness, were continually exposed to
          change. They were never in one place long. Sometimes they might tarry
          for a month in one spot -- just near the seventy palm-trees. What a
          sweet and pleasant place to go out each morning, to sit beside the
          well and drink that clear stream! |Onward!| cries Moses; and he takes
          them to a place where the bare rocks stand our from the mountain side,
          and the red burning sand is beneath their feet; vipers spring up
          around them, and thorny brakes grow instead of pleasing vegetation.
          What a change have they! Yet, another day they shall come to a place
          that shall be more dreary still. They walk through a defile so close
          and narrow, that the affrighted rays of the sun dare scarce enter such
          a prison, lest they should never find their way out again! They must
          go onward from place to place, continually changing, never having time
          to settle, and to say, |Now we are secure, in this place we shall
          dwell.| Here, again, the contrast casts light upon the text: |Ah!|
          says Moses, |though we are always changing, Lord, thou hast been our
          dwelling-place throughout all generations.| The Christian knows no
          change with regard to God. He may be rich to-day, and poor to-morrow;
          he may be sickly to-day and well to-morrow; he may be in happiness
          to-day, to-morrow he may be distressed; but there is no change with
          regard to his relationship to God. If he loved me yesterday he loves
          me to-day. I am neither better nor worse in God than I ever was. Let
          prospects be blighted, let hopes be blasted, let joy be withered, let
          mildews destroy every thing, I have lost nothing of what I have in
          God. He is my strong habitation whereunto I can continually resort.
          The Christian never becomes poorer, and never grows richer with regard
          to God. |Here,| he can say, |is a thing that never can pass away or
          change. On the brow of the Eternal there is never a furrow; his hair
          is unwhitened by age; his arm is unpalsied by weakness; his heart does
          not change in its affections; his will does not vary in its purpose;
          he is the immutable Jehovah, standing fast and forever. Thou art our
          habitation! As the house changes not, but stands in the same place, so
          have I found thee from my youth up. When first I was cast upon thee
          from my mother's breast, I found thee my God of Providence. When first
          I knew thee by that spiritual knowledge which thou alone canst give, I
          found thee a sure habitation; and I find thee such now. Yea, when I
          shall be old and gray-headed, I know thou wilt not forsake me; thou
          wilt be the same dwelling-place in all generations.|
        </p>
        <p>
          One thought more in contrasting the position of the Israelites with
          ourselves -- that is, weariness. How weary must Israel have been in
          the wilderness! How tired must have been the soles of their feet with
          their constant journeyings! They were not in a place of repose,
          luxury, and rest, but in a land of journeying, and weariness, and
          trouble. I think I see them traveling, wiping frequently the burning
          sweat from their brows, and saying, |O that we had a habitation where
          we might rest! O that we could enter a land of vines and pomegranates,
          a city where we might enjoy immunity from alarm! God has promised it
          to us, but we have not found it. There remaineth a rest for the people
          of God; O that we might find it.| Christian! God is your habitation in
          this sense. He is your rest; and you will never find rest except in
          him. I defy a man who has no God to have a soul at rest. He who has
          not Jesus for his Saviour, will always be a restless spirit. Read some
          of Byron's verses, and you will find him -- if he was truly picturing
          himself -- to be the very personification of that spirit who |walked
          to and fro seeking rest and finding none.| Here is one of his verses:
          --
        </p>
        <p>|I fly like a bird of the air,</p>
        <p>In search of a home and a rest;</p>
        <p>A balm for the sickness of care,</p>
        <p>A bliss for a bosom unblest.|</p>
        <p>
          Read the lives of any men who have had no gospel justification, or
          have had no knowledge of God, and you will find that they were like
          the poor bird that had its nest pulled down, and knew not where to
          rest, flying about, wandering, and seeking a habitation. Some of you
          have tried to find rest out of God. You have sought to find it in your
          wealth; but you have pricked your head when you have laid it on that
          pillow. You have sought it in a friend, but that friend's arm has been
          a broken reed, where you hoped it would be a wall of strength. You
          will never find rest except in God; there is no refuge but in him. Oh!
          what rest and composure are there in him! It is more than sleep, more
          than calm, more than quiet; deeper than the dead stillness of the
          noiseless sea in its utmost depths, where it is undisturbed by the
          slightest ripple, and winds can never intrude. There is a holy calm
          and sweet repose which the Christian only knows, something like the
          slumbering stars up there in beds of azure; or like the seraphic rest
          which we may suppose beatified spirits have when they before the
          throne continually bow; there is a rest so deep and calm, so still and
          quiet, so profound, that we find no words to describe it. You have
          tried it, and can rejoice in it. You know that the Lord has been your
          dwelling-place -- your sweet, calm, constant home, where you can enjoy
          peace in all generations. But I have dwelt too long upon this part of
          the subject, and I will speak of it in a different way.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, the dwelling-place of man is the place where he can
          unbend himself, and feel himself at home, and speak familiarly. In
          this pulpit I must somewhat check my words; I deal with men of the
          world who watch my speech, and are ever on the catch, men who wish to
          have this or that to retail -- I must be on my guard. So you men of
          business, when you are on the exchange, or in your shops, have to
          guard yourselves. What does the man do at home? He can lay bare his
          breast, and do and say as he pleases; it is his own house, his
          dwelling-place; and is he not master there? Shall he not do as he will
          with his own? Assuredly; for he feels himself at home. Ah! my beloved,
          do you ever find yourself in God to be at home? Have you been with
          Christ, and told your secrets in his ear, and found that you could do
          so without reserve? We do not generally tell secrets to other people,
          for it we do, and make them promise that they will never tell them,
          they will never tell them except to the first person they meet. Most
          persons who have secrets told them, are like the lady of whom it is
          said she never told her secrets except to two sorts of persons --
          those that asked her and those that did not. You must not trust men of
          the world; but do you know what it is to tell all your secrets to God
          in prayer, to whisper all your thoughts to him? You are not ashamed to
          confess your sins to him with all their aggravations; you make no
          apologies to God, but you put in every aggravation, you describe all
          the depths of you baseness. Then, as for your little wants, you would
          be ashamed to tell them to another; before God you can tell them all.
          You can tell him your grief that you would not whisper to your dearest
          friend. With God you can be always at home, you need be under no
          restraint. The Christian at once gives God the key of his heart, and
          lets him turn every thing over. He says, |There is the key of every
          cabinet; it is my desire that thou wouldst open them all. If there are
          jewels, they are thine; and if there be things that should not be
          there, drive them out. Search me, and try my heart.| The more God
          lives in the Christian, the better the Christian loves him; the
          oftener God comes to see him, the better he loves his God. And God
          loves his people all the more when they are familiar with him. Can you
          say in this sense, |Lord, thou hast been my dwelling place?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, man's home is the place where his affections are
          centered. God deliver us from those men who do not love their homes!
          Lives there a man so base, so dead, that he has no affection for his
          own house? If so, surely the spark of Christianity must have died
          entirely out. It is natural that men should love their homes; it is
          spiritual that they should love them better still. In our homes we
          find those to whom we must and ever shall be most attached. There our
          best friends and kindred dwell. When we wander, we are as birds that
          have left their nests and can find no settled home. We wish to go back
          and to see again that smile, to grasp once more that loving hand, and
          to find that we are with those to whom the ties of affection have knit
          us. We wish to feel -- and every Christian man will feel -- with
          regard to his own family, that they are the warp and woof of his own
          nature, that he has become a part and portion of them; and there he
          centers his affection. He can not afford to lavish his love
          everywhere. He centers it in that particular spot, that oasis in this
          dark desert world. Christian man, is God your habitation in that
          sense? Have you given your whole soul to God? Do you feel you can
          bring your whole heart to him, and say, |O, God! I love from my soul;
          with the most impassioned earnestness I love thee.
        </p>
        <p>|The dearest idol I have known --</p>
        <p>Whate'er that idol be --</p>
        <p>Help me to tear it from its throne,</p>
        <p>And worship only thee!|</p>
        <p>
          O God! though I sometimes wander, yet I love thee in my wanderings,
          and my heart is fixed on thee. What though the creature doth beguile
          me, I detest that creature; it is to me as the apple of Sodom. Thou
          art the master of my soul, the emperor of my heart; no vice-regent,
          but King of kings. My spirit is fixed on thee as the center of my
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>|Thou art the sea of love</p>
        <p>Where all my pleasures roll,</p>
        <p>The circle where my passions move;</p>
        <p>The center of my soul.|</p>
        <p>
          O God! thou hast been our dwelling-place throughout all generations.|
        </p>
        <p>
          My next remark is concerning the lease of this dwelling-place. God is
          the believer's habitation. Sometimes, you know, people get turned out
          of their houses, or their houses tumble down about their ears. It is
          never so with ours: God is our dwelling-place throughout all
          generations. Let us look back in times past, and we shall find that
          God has been our habitation. Oh, the old house at home! who does not
          love it -- the place of our childhood, the old roof-tree, the old
          cottage! There is no village in all the world half so good as that
          particular village where we were born! True, the gates, and stiles,
          and posts have been altered; but still there is an attachment to those
          old houses, the old tree in the park, and the old ivy-mantled tower.
          It is not very picturesque, perhaps, but we love to go to see it. We
          like to see the haunts of our boyhood. There is something pleasant in
          those old stairs where the clock used to stand; and in the room where
          grandmother was wont to bend her knee, and where we had family prayer.
          There is no place like that house after all! Well, beloved, God has
          been the habitation of the Christian in years that are gone by.
          Christian, your house is indeed a venerable house, and you have long
          dwelt there. You dwelt there in the person of Christ long before you
          were brought into this sinful world; and it is to be your
          dwelling-place throughout all generations. You are never to ask for
          another house; you will always be contented with that one you have;
          you will never wish to change your habitation. And if you wished it,
          you could not; for he is your dwelling-place in all generations. God
          give you to know what it is to take this house in its long lease, and
          ever to have God for your dwelling-place!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I come to improve this text somewhat. First, let us improve it
          to SELF EXAMINATION. How may we know whether we be Christians or not,
          whether the Lord is our dwelling-place, and will be throughout all
          generations? I shall give you some hints for self-examination, by
          referring you to several passages which I have looked out in the first
          epistle of John. It is remarkable that almost the only scriptural
          writer who speaks of God as a dwelling-place, is that most loving
          apostle, John, out of whose epistle we have been reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gives us in the 12th verse of the 4th chapter, one means of knowing
          whether we are living in God: |If we love one another, God dwelleth in
          us, and his love is perfected in us.| And again further on, he says,
          |And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is
          love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.|
          You may then tell whether you are a tenant of this great spiritual
          house by the love you have toward others. Have you a love toward the
          saints? Well, then, you are a saint yourself. The goats will not love
          the sheep; and if you love the sheep, it is an evidence that you are a
          sheep yourself. Many of the Lord's weak family never can get any other
          evidence of their conversion except this- |We know that we have passed
          from death unto life, because we love the brethren.| And though that
          is very little evidence, yet it is such a one that the strongest faith
          often can not get a much better. |If I do not love God, I love his
          people; if I am not a Christian, I love his house.| What! has the
          devil told thee thou art not the Lord's? Poor Faintheart, dost thou
          love the Lord's people? |Yes,| sayest thou, |I love to see their
          faces, and to hear their prayers; I could almost kiss the hem of their
          garments.| Is it so? and would you give them if they were poor? would
          you visit them if they were sick, and tend them if they needed
          assistance? |Ah! yes.| Then fear not. You who love God's people must
          love the Master. We know we dwell in God if we love one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 13th verse is another sign: |Hereby know we that we dwell in
          him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.| Have we
          ever had the Spirit of God in us? That is one of the most solemn
          questions I can ask. Many of you know what it is to be excited by
          religious feeling who never had the Spirit of God. Many of us have
          great need to tremble lest we should not have received that Spirit. I
          have tried myself scores of times, in different ways, to see whether I
          really am a posssessor of the Spirit of God or not. I know that the
          people of the world scoff at the idea, and say, |It is impossible for
          any body to have the Spirit of God.| Then it is impossible for any
          body to go to heaven; for we must have the Spirit of God, we must be
          born again of the Spirit, before we can enter there. What a serious
          question is this: |Have I had the Spirit of God in me? True, my soul
          is at times lifted on high, and I feel I could sing like a seraph.
          True, sometimes I am melted down by deep devotion, and I could pray in
          terrible solemnity. But so could hypocrites, perhaps. Have I the
          Spirit of God? Have you any evidence within you that you have the
          Spirit? Are you sure that you are not laboring under a delusion and a
          dream? Have you actually the Spirit of God within you? If so, you
          dwell in God. That is the second sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the apostle gives another sign in the 15th verse: |Whosoever shall
          confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in
          God.| The confession of our faith in the Saviour is another sign that
          we live in God. Oh! poor heart, canst thou not come under this sign?
          Thou mayest have but little boldness, but canst thou say, |I believe
          in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?| If so, thou dwellest in God.
          Many of you, I know, say -- |When I hear a sermon, I feel affected by
          it. When I am in the house of God I feel like a child of God, but the
          business, cares, and troubles of life take me off, and then I fear I
          am not.| But you can say, |I do believe in Christ; I know I cast
          myself on his mercy, and hope to be saved by him.| Then do not say you
          are not a child of God if you have faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one more sign whereby we ought to examine ourselves, in
          the 3rd chapter, 24th verse: |He that keepeth his commandments
          dwelleth in him, and he in him.| Obedience to the commandments of God
          is a blessed sign of a dwelling in God. Some of you have a deal of
          religious talk, but not much religious walk; a large stock of outside
          piety, but not much real inward piety, which develops itself in your
          actions. That is a hint for some of you who know that it is right to
          be baptized, and are not. You know it is one of the commandments of
          God, that |he that believeth shall be baptized,| and you are
          neglecting what you know to be your duty. You are dwelling in God, I
          doubt not, but you lack one evidence of it, namely -- obedience to
          God's commandments. Obey God, and then you will know that you are
          dwelling in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have another word by way of improvement, and that is one of
          CONGRATULATION. You who dwell in God, allow me to congratulate you.
          Thrice happy men are ye, if ye are dwelling in God! You need not blush
          to compare yourselves with angels, you need not think that any on
          earth can share such happiness as yours! Zion, O how blessed art thou,
          freed from all sins! Now thou art, through Christ, made to dwell in
          God, and therefore art eternally secure! I congratulate you,
          Christians, first, that you have such a magnificent house to dwell in.
          You have not a palace that shall be as gorgeous as Solomon's -- a
          mighty palace as immense as the dwellings of the kings of Assyria, or
          Babylon; but you have a God that is more than mortal creatures can
          behold; you dwell in an immortal fabric, you dwell in the Godhead --
          something which is beyond all human skill. I congratulate you,
          moreover, that you live in such a perfect house. There never was a
          house on earth that could not be made a little better; but the house
          you dwell in has every thing you want; in God you have all you
          require. I congratulate you, moreover, that you live in a house that
          shall last forever, a dwelling-place that shall not pass away; when
          this world shall have been scattered like a dream; when, like the
          bubble on the breaker, creation shall have died away; when all this
          universe shall have died out like a spark from an expiring brand, your
          house shall live and stand more imperishable than marble, more solid
          than granite, self-existent as God, for it is God! Be happy then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, lastly, a word of ADMONITION AND WARNING to some of you. My
          hearers, what a pity it is that we have to divide our congregation,
          that we can not speak to you in a mass as being all Christians. This
          morning, I would I could take God's word and address it to you all,
          that you all might share the sweet promises it contains. But some of
          you would not have them if I were to offer them. Some of you despise
          Christ, my blessed Master. Many of you think sin to be a trifle, and
          grace to be worthless, heaven to be a vision, and hell to be a
          fiction. Some of you are careless, and hardened, and thoughtless,
          without God, and without Christ. Oh! my hearers, I wonder at myself
          that I should have so little benevolence, that I do not preach more
          fervently to you. Methinks if I could get a right estimate of your
          souls' value that I should speak not as I do now with stammering
          tongue, but with flaming words. I have great cause to blush at my own
          slothfulness, though God knows I have striven to preach God's truth as
          vehemently as possible, and would spend myself in his service; but I
          wonder I do not stand in every street in London and preach his truth.
          When I think of the thousands of souls in this great city that have
          never heard of Jesus, that have never listened to him; when I think of
          how much ignorance exists, and how little gospel preaching there is,
          how few souls are saved, I think -- O God! what little grace I must
          have, that I do not strive more for souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          One word by way of warning. Do you know, poor soul, that you have not
          a house to live in? You have a house for your body but no house for
          your soul. Have you ever seen a poor girl at midnight sitting down on
          a door-step crying? Somebody passes by, and says, |Why do you sit
          here?| |I have no house, sir. I have no home.| |Where is your father?|
          |My father's dead, sir.| |Where is your mother?| |I have no mother,
          sir.| |Have you no friends?| |No friends at all.| |Have you no house?|
          |No; I have none. I am houseless.| And she shivers in the chill air,
          and gathers her poor ragged shawl around her, and cries again, |I have
          no house -- I have no home.| Would you not pity her? Would you blame
          her for her tears? Ah! there are some of you that have houseless souls
          here this morning. It is something to have a houseless body; but to
          think of a houseless soul! Methinks I see you in eternity sitting on
          the door-step of heaven. An angel says, |What! have you no house to
          live in?| |No house,| says the poor soul.| |Have you no father?| |No;
          God is not my father; and there is none beside him.| |Have you no
          mother?| |No; the church is not my mother; I never sought her ways,
          nor loved Jesus. I have neither father nor mother.| |Have you no
          house, then?| |No; I am a houseless soul.| But there is one thing
          worse about that -- houseless souls have to be sent into hell; to a
          dungeon, to a lake that burns with fire. Houseless soul! in a little
          while thy body will have gone; and where wilt thou house thyself when
          the hot hail of eternal vengeance comes from heaven? Where wilt thou
          hide thy guilty head, when the winds of the last judgment-day shall
          sweep on thee with fury? Where wilt thou shelter thyself, when the
          blast of the terrible one shall be as a storm against a wall, when the
          darkness of eternity comes upon thee, and hell thickens round thee? It
          will be all in vain for you to cry, |Rocks, hide me; mountains, fall
          upon me;| the rocks will not obey you, the mountains will not hide
          you. Caverns would be palaces if you could dwell in them, but there
          will be no caverns for you to hide your head in, but you will be
          houseless souls, houseless spirits, wandering through the shades of
          hell, tormented, destitute, afflicted, and that throughout eternity.
          Poor houseless soul, dost thou want a house? I have a house to let
          this morning for every sinner who feels his misery. Do you want a
          house for your soul? Then I will condescend to men of low estate, and
          tell you in homely language, that I have a house to let. Do you ask me
          what is the purchase? I will tell you; it is something less than proud
          human nature will like to give. It is without money and without price.
          Ah! you would like to pay some rent wouldn't you? You would love to do
          something to win Christ. You can not have the house then; it is
          |without money and without price.| I have told you enough of the house
          itself, and therefore I will not describe its excellences. But I will
          tell you one thing -- that if you feel that you are a houseless soul
          this morning, you may have the key to-morrow; and if you feel yourself
          to be a houseless soul to-day, you may enter it now. If you had a
          house of your own I would not offer it to you; but since you have no
          other, here it is. Will you take my Master's house on a lease for all
          eternity, with nothing to pay for it, nothing but the ground-rent of
          loving and serving him forever? Will you take Jesus, and dwell in him
          throughout eternity? or will you be content to be a houseless soul?
          Come inside, sir; see, it is furnished from top to bottom with all you
          want. It has cellars filled with gold, more than you will spend as
          long as you live; it hath a parlor where you can entertain yourself
          with Christ, and feast on his love; it has tables well stored with
          food for you to live on forever; it hath a drawing-room of brotherly
          love where you can receive your friends. You will find a resting room
          up there where you can rest with Jesus; and on the top there is a
          look-out, whence you can see heaven itself. Will you have the house,
          or will you not? Ah! if you are houseless, you will say, |I should
          like to have the house; but may I have it?| Yes; there is the key. The
          key is, |Come to Jesus.| But, you say, |I am too shabby for such a
          house.| Never mind; there are garments inside. As Rowland Hill once
          said --
        </p>
        <p>|Come naked, come filthy, come ragged, come poor,</p>
        <p>Come wretched, come dirty, come just as you are.|</p>
        <p>
          If you feel guilty and condemned, come, and though the house is too
          good for you, Christ will make you good enough for the house
          by-and-by. He will wash you, and cleanse you, and you will yet be able
          to sing with Moses, with the same unfaltering voice, |Lord, thou hast
          been my dwelling place throughout all generations.|<br />
