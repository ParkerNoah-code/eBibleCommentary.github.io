          1. Thus, then, have all these men been exposed, who bring in impious
          doctrines regarding our Maker and Framer, who also formed this world,
          and above whom there is no other God; and those have been overthrown
          by their own arguments who teach falsehoods regarding the substance of
          our Lord, and the dispensation which He fulfilled for the sake of His
          own creature man. But [it has, on the other hand, been shown], that
          the preaching of the Church is everywhere consistent, and continues in
          an even course, and receives testimony from the prophets, the
          apostles, and all the disciples -- as I have proved -- through [those
          in] the beginning, the middle, and the end, and through the entire
          dispensation of God, and that well-grounded system which tends to
          man's salvation, namely, our faith; which, having been received from
          the Church, we do preserve, and which always, by the Spirit of God,
          renewing its youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an
          excellent vessel, causes the vessel itself containing it to renew its
          youth also. For this gift of God has been entrusted to the Church, as
          breath was to the first created man, for this purpose, that all the
          members receiving it may be vivified; and the [means of] communion
          with Christ has been distributed throughout it, that is, the Holy
          Spirit, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming our
          faith, and the ladder of ascent to God. |For in the Church,| it is
          said, |God hath set apostles, prophets, teachers,| and all the other
          means through which the Spirit works; of which all those are not
          partakers who do not join themselves to the Church, but defraud
          themselves of life through their perverse opinions and infamous
          behaviour. For where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and
          where the Spirit of God is, there is the Church, and every kind of
          grace; but the Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, who do not partake
          of Him, are neither nourished into life from the mother's breasts, nor
          do they enjoy that most limpid fountain which issues from the body of
          Christ; but they dig for themselves broken cisterns out of earthly
          trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the
          faith of the Church lest they be convicted; and rejecting the Spirit,
          that they may not be instructed.

          2. Alienated thus from the truth, they do deservedly wallow in all
          error, tossed to and fro by it, thinking differently in regard to the
          same things at different times, and never attaining to a well-grounded
          knowledge, being more anxious to be sophists of words than disciples
          of the truth. For they have not been founded upon the one rock, but
          upon the sand, which has in itself a multitude of stones. Wherefore
          they also imagine many gods, and they always have the excuse of
          searching [after truth] (for they are blind), but never succeed in
          finding it. For they blaspheme the Creator, Him who is truly God, who
          also furnishes power to find [the truth]; imagining that they have
          discovered another god beyond God, or another Pleroma, or another
          dispensation. Wherefore also the light which is from God does not
          illumine them, because they have dishonoured and despised God, holding
          Him of small account, because, through His love and infinite
          benignity, He has come within reach of human knowledge (knowledge,
          however, not with regard to His greatness, or with regard to His
          essence -- for that has no man measured or handled -- but after this
          sort: that we should know that He who made, and formed, and breathed
          in them the breath of life, and nourishes us by means of the creation,
          establishing all things by His Word, and binding them together by His
          Wisdom -- this is He who is the only true God); but they dream of a
          non-existent being above Him, that they may be regarded as having
          found out the great God, whom nobody, [they hold,] can recognise
          holding communication with the human race, or as directing mundane
          matters: that is to say, they find out the god of Epicurus, who does
          nothing either for himself or others; that is, he exercises no
          providence at all.<br />
