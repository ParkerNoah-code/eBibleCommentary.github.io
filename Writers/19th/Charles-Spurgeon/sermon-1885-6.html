          |The day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
          according to my gospel.| -- Romans 2:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS impossible for any of us to tell what it cost the apostle Paul
          to write the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans. It is a shame
          even to speak of the things which are done of the vicious in secret
          places; but Paul felt it was necessary to break through his shame, and
          to speak out concerning the hideous vices of the heathen. He has left
          on record an exposure of the sins of his day which crimsons the cheek
          of the modest when they read it, and makes both the ears of him that
          heareth it to tingle. Paul knew that this chapter would be read, not
          in his age alone, but in all ages, and that it would go into the
          households of the most pure and godly as long as the world should
          stand; and yet he deliberately wrote it, and wrote it under the
          guidance of the Holy Spirit. He knew that it must be written to put to
          shame the abominations of an age which was almost past shame. Monsters
          that revel in darkness must be dragged into the open, that they may be
          withered up by the light. After Paul has thus written in anguish he
          bethought himself of his chief comfort. While his pen was black with
          the words he had written in the first chapter, he was driven to write
          of his great delight. He clings to the gospel with a greater tenacity
          than ever. As in the verse before us he needed to mention the gospel,
          he did not speak of it as |the gospel,| but as |my gospel.| |God shall
          judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.| He
          felt he could not live in the midst of so depraved a people without
          holding the gospel with both hands, and grasping it as his very own.
          |My gospel,| saith he. Not that Paul was the author of it, not that
          Paul had an exclusive monopoly of its blessings, but that he had so
          received it from Christ himself, and regarded himself as so
          responsibly put in trust with it, that he could not disown it even for
          a instant. So fully had he taken it into himself that he could not do
          less than call it |my gospel.| In another place he speaks of |our
          gospel;| thus using a possessive pronoun, to show how believers
          identify themselves with the truth which they preach. He had a gospel,
          a definite form of truth, and he believed in it beyond all doubt; and
          therefore he spoke of it as |my gospel.| Herein we hear the voice of
          faith, which seems to say, |Though others reject it, I am sure of it,
          and allow no shade of mistrust to darken my mind. To me it is glad
          tidings of great joy: I hail it as 'my gospel.' If I be called a fool
          for holding it, I am content to be a fool, and to find all my wisdom
          in my Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |Should all the forms that men devise Assult my faith with treacherous
          art, I'd call them vanity and lies, And bind the gospel to my heart.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this word |my gospel| the voice of love? Does he not by this
          word embrace the gospel as the only love of his soul -- for the sake
          of which he had suffered the loss of all things, and did count them
          but dung -- for the sake of which he was willing to stand before Nero,
          and proclaim, even in Caesar's palace, the message from heaven? Though
          each word should cost him a life, he was willing to die a thousand
          deaths for the holy cause. |My gospel,| saith he, with a rapture of
          delight, as he presses to his bosom the sacred deposit of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          |My gospel.| Does not this show his courage? As much as to say, |I am
          not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto
          salvation to every one that believeth.| He says, |my gospel,| as a
          soldier speaks of |my colours,| or of |my king.| He resolves to bear
          this banner to victory, and to serve this royal truth even to the
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          |My gospel.| There is a touch of discrimination about the expression.
          Paul perceives that there are other gospels, and he makes short work
          with them, for he saith, |Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach
          any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
          let me be accused.| The apostle was of a gentle spirit; he prayed
          heartily for the Jews who persecuted him, and yielded his life for the
          conversion of the Gentiles who maltreated him; but he had no tolerance
          for false gospellers. He exhibited great breadth of mind, and to save
          souls he became all things to all men; but when he contemplated any
          alteration or adulteration of the gospel of Christ, he thundered and
          lightninged without measure. When he feared that something else might
          spring up among the philosophers, or among the Judaizers, that should
          hide a single beam of the glorious Sun of Righteousness, he used no
          measured language; but cried concerning the author of such a darkening
          influence, |Let him be accursed.| Every heart that would see men
          blessed whispers an |Amen| to the apostolic malediction. No greater
          curse can come upon mankind than the obscuration of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ. Paul saith of himself and his true brethren, |We are not
          as many, which corrupt the word of God;| and he cries to those who
          turned aside from the one and only gospel, |O foolish Galatians, who
          hath bewitched you?| Of all new doctrines he speaks as of |another
          gospel, which is not another; but there be some that trouble you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          As for myself, looking at the matter afresh, amidst all the filthiness
          which I see in the world at this day, I lay hold upon the pure and
          blessed Word of God, and call it all the more earnestly, my gospel, --
          mine in life and mine in death, mine against all comers, mine for
          ever, God helping me: with emphasis -- |my gospel.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let us notice what it was that brought up this expression, |My
          gospel.| What was Paul preaching about? Certainly not upon any of the
          gentle and tender themes, which we are told nowadays ought to occupy
          all our time; but he is speaking of the terrors of the law, and in
          that connection he speaks of |my gospel.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us come at once to our text. It will need no dividing, for it
          divides itself. First, let us consider that on a certain day God shall
          judge mankind; secondly, on that day God will judge the secrets of
          men; thirdly, when he judges the secrets of men, it will be by Jesus
          Christ; and fourthly, this is according to gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We begin with the solemn truth, that ON A CERTAIN DAY GOD WILL
          JUDGE MEN. A judgment is going on daily. God is continually holding
          court, and considering the doings of the sons of men. Every evil deed
          that they do is recorded in the register of doom, and each good action
          is remembered and laid up in store by God. That judgment is reflected
          in a measure in the consciences of men. Those who know the gospel, and
          those who know it not, alike, have a certain measure of light, by
          which they know right from wrong; their consciences all the while
          accusing or else excusing them. This session of the heavenly court
          continues from day to day, like that of our local magistrates; but
          this does not prevent but rather necessitates the holding of an
          ultimate great assize.
        </p>
        <p>
          As each man passes into another world, there is an immediate judgment
          passed upon him; but this is only the foreshadowing of that which will
          take place in the end of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a judgment also passing upon nations, for as nations will not
          exist as nations in another world, they have to be judged and punished
          in this present state. The thoughtful reader of history will not fail
          to observe, how sternly this justice had dealt with empire after
          empire, when they have become corrupt. Colossal dominions have
          withered to the ground, when sentenced by the King of kings. Go ye and
          ask to-day, |Where is the empire of Assyria? Where are the mighty
          cities of Babylon? Where are the glories of the Medes and Persians?
          What has become of the Macedonian power? Where are the Caesars and
          their palaces?| These empires were forces established by cruelty, and
          used for oppression; they fostered luxury and licentiousness, and when
          they were no longer tolerable, the earth was purged from their
          polluting existence. Ah me! what horrors of war, bloodshed, and
          devastation, have come upon men as the result of their iniquities! The
          world is full of the monuments, both of the mercy and the justice of
          God: in fact the monuments of his justice, if rightly viewed, are
          proofs of his goodness; for it is mercy on the part of God to put an
          end to evil systems when, like a nightmare, they weigh heavily upon
          the bosom of mankind. The omnipotent, Judge has not ceased from his
          sovereign rule over kingdoms, and our own country may yet have to feel
          his chastisements. We have often laughed among ourselves at the idea
          of the New Zealander sitting on the broken arch of London Bridge amid
          the ruins of this metropolis. But is it quite so ridiculous as it
          looks? It is more than possible it will be realized if our iniquities
          continue to abound. What is there about London that it should be more
          enduring than Rome? Why should the palaces of our monarches be eternal
          if the palaces of Koyunjik have fallen? The almost boundless power of
          the Pharaohs has passed away, and Egypt has become the meanest of
          nations; why should not England come under like condemnation? What are
          we? What is there about our boastful race, whether on this side of the
          Atlantic or the other, that we should monopolize the favour of God? If
          we rebel, and sin against him, he will not hold us guiltless, but will
          deal out impartial justice to an ungrateful race.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, though such judgments proceed every day, yet there is to be a
          day, a period of time, in which, in a more distinct, formal, public,
          and final manner, God will judge the sons of men. We might have
          guessed this by the light of nature and of reason. Even heathen
          peoples have had a dim notion of a day of doom; but we are not left to
          guess it, we are solemnly assured of it in the Holy Scripture.
          Accepting this Book as the revelation of God, we know beyond all doubt
          that a day is appointed in which the Lord will judge the secrets of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          By judging is here meant all that concerns the proceedings of trial
          and award. God will judge the race of men; that is to say, first,
          there will be a session of majesty, and the appearing of a great white
          throne, surrounded with pomp of angels and glorified beings. Then a
          summons will be issued, bidding all men come to judgment, to give in
          their final account. The heralds will fly through the realms of death,
          and summon those who sleep in the dust: for the quick and the dead
          shall all appear before that judgment-seat. John says, |I saw the
          dead, small and great, stand before God;| and he adds, |The sea gave
          up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead
          which were in them.| Those that have been so long buried that their
          dust is mingled with the soil, and has undergone a thousand
          transmutations, shall nevertheless be made to put in a personal
          appearance before the judgment-seat of Christ. What an issue will that
          be! You and I and all the myriad myriads of our race shall be gathered
          before the throne of the Son of God. Then, when all are gathered, the
          indictment will be read, and each one will be examined concerning
          things done in the body, according to that he hath done. Then the
          books shall be opened, and everything recorded there shall be read
          before the face of heaven. Every sinner shall then hear the story of
          his life published to his everlasting shame. The good shall ask no
          concealment, and the evil shall find none. Angels and men shall then
          see the truth of things, and the saints shall judge the world. Then
          the great Judge himself shall give the decision: he shall pronounce
          sentence upon the wicked, and execute their punishment. No partiality
          shall there be seen; there shall be no private conferences to secure
          immunity for nobles, no hushing up of matters, that great men may
          escape contempt for their crimes. All men shall stand before the one
          great judgment-bar; evidence shall be given concerning them all, and a
          righteous sentence shall go forth from his mouth who knows not how to
          flatter the great.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be so, and it ought to be so: God should judge the world,
          because he is the universal ruler and sovereign. There has been a day
          for sinning, there ought to be a day for punishing; a long age of
          rebellion has been endured, and there must be a time when justice
          shall assert her supremacy. We have seen an age in which reformation
          has been commanded, in which mercy has been presented, in which
          expostulation and entreaty have been used, and there ought at last to
          come a day in which God shall judge both the quick and the dead, and
          measure out to each the final result of life. It ought to be so for
          the sake of the righteous. They have been slandered; they have been
          despised and ridiculed; worse than that, they have been imprisoned and
          beaten, and put to death times without number: the best have had the
          worst of it, and there ought to be a judgment to set these things
          right. Besides the festering iniquities of each age cry out to God
          that he should deal with them. Shall such sin go unpunished? To what
          end is there a moral government at all, and how is its continuance to
          be secured, if there be not rewards and punishments and a day of
          account? For the display of his holiness, for the overwhelming of his
          adversaries, for the rewarding of those who have faithfully served
          him, there must be and shall be a day in which God will judge the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why doth it not come at once? And when will it come? The precise day
          we cannot tell. Man nor angel knoweth that day, and it is idle and
          profane to guess at it, since even the Son of man, as such, knoweth
          not the time. It is sufficient for us that the Judgment Day will
          surely come; sufficient also to believe that it is postponed on
          purpose to give breathing time for mercy, and space for repentance.
          Why should the ungodly want to know when that day will come? What is
          that day to you? To you it should be darkness, and not light. It shall
          be your day of consuming as stubble fully dry: therefore bless the
          Lord that he delayeth his coming, and reckon that his longsuffering is
          for your salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Lord keeps the scaffold standing till he hath built up
          the fabric of his church. Not yet are the elect all called out from
          among the guilty sons of men; not yet are all the redeemed with blood
          redeemed with power and brought forth out of the corruption of the age
          into the holiness in which they walk with God. Therefore the Lord
          waiteth for a while. But do not deceive yourselves. The great day of
          his wrath cometh on apace, and your days of reprieve are numbered. One
          day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
          day. Ye shall die, perhaps, before the appearing of the Son of man:
          but ye shall see his judgment-seat for all that, for ye shall rise
          again as surely as he rose. When the apostle addressed the Grecian
          sages at Athens he said, |God now commandeth all men everywhere to
          repent, because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
          the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof
          he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from
          the dead.| See ye not, O ye impenitent ones, that a risen Saviour is
          the sign of your doom. As God hath raised Jesus from the dead, so
          shall he raise your bodies, that in these you may come to judgment.
          Before the judgment-seat shall every man and woman in this house give
          an account of the things done in the body, whether they be good or
          whether they be evil. Thus saith the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I call your attention to the fact that |GOD WILL JUDGE THE
          SECRETS OF MEN.| This will happen to all men, of every nation, of
          every age, of every rank, and of every character. The Judge will, of
          course, judge their outward acts, but these may be said to have gone
          before them to judgment: their secret acts are specially mentioned,
          because these will make judgment to be the more searching.
        </p>
        <p>
          By |secrets of men,| the Scripture means those secret crimes which
          hide themselves away by their own infamy, which are too vile to be
          spoken of, which cause a shudder to go through a nation if they be but
          dragged, as they ought to be, into the daylight. Secret offences shall
          be brought into judgment; the deeds of the night and of the closed
          room, the acts which require the finger to be laid upon the lip, and a
          conspiracy of silence to be sworn. Revolting and shameless sins which
          must never be mentioned lest the man who committed them should be
          excluded from his fellows as an outcast, abhorred even of other
          sinners -- all those shall be revealed. All that you have done, any of
          you, or are doing, if you are bearing the Christian name and yet
          practising secret sin, shall be laid bare before the universal gaze.
          If you sit here amongst the people of God, and yet where no eye sees
          you, if you are living in dishonesty, untruthfulness, or uncleanness,
          it shall all be known, and shame and confusion of face shall eternally
          cover you. Contempt shall be the inheritance to which you shall awake,
          when hypocrisy shall be no more possible. Be not deceived, God is not
          mocked; but he will bring the secrets of men into judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specially our text refers to the hidden motives of ever action; for a
          man may do that which is right from a wrong motive, and so the deed
          may be evil in the sight of God, though it seem right in the sight of
          men. Oh, think what it will be to have your motives all brought to
          light, to have it proven that you were godly for the sake of gain,
          that you were generous out of ostentation, or zealous for love of
          praise, that you were careful in public to maintain a religious
          reputation, but that all the while everything was done for self, and
          self only! What a strong light will that be which God shall turn upon
          our lives, when the darkest chambers of human desire and motive shall
          be as manifest as public acts! What a revelation will that be which
          makes manifest all thoughts, and imaginings, and lustings, and
          desires! All angers, and envies, and prides, and rebellions of the
          heart -- what a disclosure will these make!
        </p>
        <p>
          All the sensual desires and imaginings of even the best-regulated,
          what a foulness will these appear! What a day it will be, when the
          secrets of men shall be set in the full blaze of noon!
        </p>
        <p>
          God will also reveal secrets, that were secrets even to the sinners
          themselves, for there is sin in us which we have never seen, and
          iniquity in us which we have never yet discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have managed for our own comfort's sake to blind our eyes somewhat,
          and we take care to avert our gaze from things which it is
          inconvenient to see; but we shall be compelled to see all these evils
          in that day, when the Lord shall judge the secrets of men. I do not
          wonder that when a certain Rabbi read in the book of Ecclesiastes that
          God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
          whether it be good, or whether it be evil, he wept. It is enough to
          make the best men tremble. Were it not for thee, O Jesus, whose
          precious blood hath cleansed us from all sin, where should we be! Were
          it not for thy righteousness, which shall cover those who believe in
          thee, who among us could endure the thought of that tremendous day? In
          thee, O Jesus, we are made righteous, and therefore we fear not the
          trial-hour; but were it not for thee our hearts would fail us for
          fear!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if you ask me why God should judge, especially the secrets of men
          -- since this is not done in human courts, and cannot be, for secret
          things of this kind come not under cognizance of our short-sighted
          tribunals -- I answer it is because there is really nothing secret
          from God. We make a difference between secret and public sins, but he
          doth not; for all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with
          whom we have to do. All deeds are done in the immediate presence of
          God, who is personally present everywhere. He knows and sees all
          things as one upon the spot, and every secret sin is but conceived to
          be secret through the deluded fantasy of our ignorance. God sees more
          of a secret sin than a man can see of that which is done before his
          face. |Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
          saith the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The secrets of men will be judged because often the greatest of moral
          acts are done in secret. The brightest deeds that God delights in are
          those that are done by his servants when they have shut the door and
          are alone with him; when they have no motive but to please him; when
          they studiously avoid publicity, lest they should be turned aside by
          the praise of men; when the right hand knoweth not what the left hand
          doeth, and the loving, generous heart deviseth liberal things, and
          doeth it behind the screen, so that it should never be discovered how
          the deed was done. It were a pity that such deeds should be left out
          at the great audit. Thus, too, secret vices are also of the very
          blackest kind, and to exempt them were to let the worst of sinners go
          unpunished. Shall it be that these polluted things shall escape
          because they have purchased silence with their wealth? I say solemnly
          |God forbid.| He does forbid it: what they have done in secret, shall
          be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, the secret things of men enter into the very essence of their
          actions. An action is, after all, good or bad very much according to
          its motive. It may seem good, but the motive may taint it; and so, if
          God did not judge the secret part of the action he would not judge
          righteously. He will weigh our actions, and detect the design which
          led to them, and the spirit which prompted them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not certainly true that the secret thing is the best evidence of
          the man's condition? Many a man will not do in public that which would
          bring him shame; not because he is black-hearted enough for it, but
          because he is too much of a coward. That which a man does when he
          thinks that he is entirely by himself is the best revelation of the
          man. That which thou wilt not do because it would be told of thee if
          thou didst ill, is a poor index of thy real character. That which thou
          wilt do because thou wilt be praised for doing well, is an equally
          faint test of thy heart. Such virtue is mere self-seeking, or
          mean-spirited subservience to thy fellow-man; but that which thou
          doest out of respect to no authority but thine own conscience and thy
          God; that which thou doest unobserved, without regard to what man will
          say concerning it -- that it is which reveals thee, and discovers thy
          real soul. Hence God lays a special stress and emphasis upon the fact
          that he will in that day judge |the secrets| of men by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, friends, if it does not make you tremble to think of these things,
          it ought to do so. I feel the deep responsibility of preaching upon
          such matters, and I pray God of his infinite mercy to apply these
          truths to our hearts, that they may be forceful upon our lives. These
          truths ought to startle us, but I am afraid we hear them with small
          result; we have grown familiar with them, and they do not penetrate us
          as they should. We have to deal, brethren, with an omniscient God;
          with One who once knowing never forgets; with One to whom all things
          are always present; with One will conceal nothing out of fear, or
          favour of any man's person; with One who will shortly bring the
          splendour of his omniscience and the impartiality of his justice to
          bear upon all human lives. God help us, where'er we rove and where'er
          we rest, to remember that each thought, word, and act of each moment
          lies in that fierce light which beats upon all things from the throne
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Another solemn revelation of our text lies in this fact, that
          |GOD WILL JUDGE THE SECRETS OF MEN BY JESUS CHRIST.| He that will sit
          upon the throne as the Vice-regent of God, and as a Judge, acting for
          God, will be Jesus Christ. What a name for a Judge! The<br />Saviour-Anointed
          -- Jesus Christ: he is to be the judge of all mankind. Our Redeemer
          will be the Umpire of our destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be, I doubt not, first for the display of his glory. What a
          difference there will be then between the babe of Bethlehem's manger,
          hunted by Herod, carried down by night into Egypt for shelter, and the
          King of kings and Lord of lords, before whom every knee must bow! What
          a difference between the weary man and full of woes, and he that shall
          then be grit with glory, sitting on a throne encircled with a rainbow!
          From the derision of men to the throne of universal judgment, what an
          ascent! I am unable to convey to you my own heart's sense of the
          contrast between the |despised and rejected of men,| and the
          universally-acknowledged Lord, before whom Caesars and pontiffs shall
          bow into the dust. He who was judged at Pilate's bar, shall summon all
          to his bar. What a change from the shame and spitting, from the nails
          and the wounds, the mockery and the thirst, and the dying anguish, to
          the glory in which he shall come whose eyes are as a flame of fire,
          and out of whose mouth there goeth a two-edged sword! He shall judge
          the nations, even he whom the nations abhorred. He shall break them in
          pieces like a potter's vessel, even those who cast him out as unworthy
          to live among them. Oh, how we ought to bow before him now as he
          reveals himself in his tender sympathy, and in his generous
          humiliation! Let us kiss the Son lest he be angry; let us yield to his
          grace, that we may not be crushed by his wrath. Ye sinners, bow before
          those pierced feet, which else will tread you like clusters in the
          wine-press. Look ye up to him with weeping, and confess your
          forgetfulness of him, and put your trust in him; lest he look down on
          you in indignation. Oh, remember that he will one day say, |But those
          mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring
          hither, and slay them before me.| The holding of the judgment by the
          Lord Jesus will greatly enhance his glory. It will finally settle one
          controversy which is still upheld by certain erroneous spirits: there
          will be no doubt about our Lord's deity in that day: there will be no
          question that this same Jesus who was crucified is both Lord and God.
          God himself shall judge, but he shall perform the judgment in the
          person of his Son Jesus Christ, truly man, but nevertheless most truly
          God. Being God he is divinely qualified to judge the world in
          righteousness, and the people with his truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ask again, Why is the Son of God chosen to be the final Judge?
          I could give as a further answer that he receives this high office not
          only as a reward for all his pains, and as a manifestation of his
          glory, but also because men have been under his mediatorial sway, and
          he is their Governor and King. At the present moment we are all under
          the sway of the Prince Immanuel, God with us: we have been placed by
          an act of divine clemency, not under the immediate government of an
          offended God, but under the reconciling rule of the Prince of Peace.
          |All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth.| |The Father
          judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all
          men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.| We are
          commanded to preach unto the people, and |to testify that it is he
          which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead.| (Acts
          10:42) Jesus is our Lord and King, and it is meet that he should
          conclude his mediatorial sovereignty by rewarding his subjects to
          their deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have somewhat to say unto you which ought to reach your hearts,
          even if other thoughts have not done so. I think that God hath chosen
          Christ, the man Christ Jesus, to judge the world that there may never
          be a cavil raised concerning that judgment. Men shall not be able to
          say -- We were judged by a superior being who did not know our
          weaknesses and temptations, and therefore he judged us harshly, and
          without a generous consideration of our condition. No, God shall judge
          the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, who was tempted in all points like
          as we are, yet without sin. He is our brother, bone of our bone, flesh
          of our flesh, partaker of our humanity, and therefore understands and
          knows what is in men. He has shown himself to be skilful in all the
          surgery of mercy throughout the ages, and at last he will be found
          equally skilful in dissecting motives and revealing the thoughts and
          intents of the heart. Nobody shall ever be able to look back on that
          august tribunal and say that he who sat upon it was too stern, because
          he knew nothing of human weakness. It will be the loving Christ, whose
          tears, and bloody sweat, and gaping wounds, attest his brotherhood
          with mankind; and it will be clear to all intelligences that however
          dread his sentences, he could not be unmerciful. God shall judge us by
          Jesus Christ, that the judgment may be indisputable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But harken well -- for I speak with a great weight upon my soul --
          this judgment by Jesus Christ, puts beyond possibility all hope of any
          after-interposition. If the Saviour condemns, and such a Saviour, who
          can plead for us? The owner of the vineyard was about to cut down the
          barren tree, when the dresser of the vineyard pleaded, |Let it alone
          this year also;| but what can come of that tree when that vinedresser
          himself shall say to the master, |It must fall; I myself must cut it
          down!| If your Saviour shall become your judge you will be judged
          indeed. If he shall say, |Depart, ye cursed,| who can call you back?
          If he that bled to save men at last comes to this conclusion, that
          there is no more to be done, but they must be driven from his
          presence, then farewell hope. To the guilty the judgment will indeed
          be a
        </p>
        <p>|Great day of dread, decision, and despair.|</p>
        <p>
          An infinite horror shall seize upon their spirits as the words of the
          loving Christ shall freeze their very marrow, and fix them in the ice
          of eternal despair. There is, to my mind, a climax of solemnity in the
          fact that God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does not this also show how certain the sentence will be? for this
          Christ of God is too much in earnest to play with men. If he says,
          |Come, ye blessed,| he will not fail to bring them to their
          inheritance. If he be driven to say, |Depart, ye cursed,| he will see
          it done, and into the everlasting punishment they must go. Even when
          it cost him his life he did not draw back from doing the will of his
          Father, nor will he shrink in that day when he shall pronounce the
          sentence of doom. Oh, how evil must sin be since it constrains the
          tender Saviour to pronounce sentence of eternal woe! I am sure that
          many of us have been driven of late to an increased hatred of sin; our
          souls have recoiled within us because of the wickedness among which we
          dwell; it has made us feel as if we would fain borrow the Almighty's
          thunderbolts with which to smite iniquity. Such haste on our part may
          not be seemly, since it implies a complaint against divine
          long-suffering; but Christ's dealing with evil will be calm and
          dispassionate, and all the more crushing. Jesus, with his pierced
          hand, that bears the attestation of his supreme love to men, shall
          wave the impenitent away; and those lips which bade the weary rest in
          him shall solemnly say to the wicked, |Depart, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.| To be
          trampled beneath the foot which was nailed to the cross will be to be
          crushed indeed: yet so it is, God shall judge the secrets of men by
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to me as if God in this intended to give a display of the
          unity of all his perfections. In this same man, Christ Jesus, the Son
          of God, you behold justice and love, mercy and righteousness, combined
          in equal measure. He turns to the right, and says, |Come, ye blessed,|
          with infinite suavity; and with the same lip, as he glances to the
          left, he says, |Depart, ye cursed.| Men will then see at one glance
          how love and righteousness are one, and how they meet in equal
          splendour in the person of the Well-beloved, whom God has therefore
          chosen to be Judge of quick and dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I have done when you have borne with me a minute or two upon my
          next point, which is this: and ALL THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL.
          That is to say, there is nothing in the gospel contrary to the solemn
          teaching. Men gather to us, to hear us preach of infinite mercy, and
          tell of the love that blots out sin; and our task is joyful when we
          are called to deliver such a message; but oh, sirs, remember that
          nothing in our message makes light of sin. The gospel offers you no
          opportunity of going on in sin, and escaping without punishment. Its
          own cry is, |Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.| Jesus
          has not come into the world to make sin less terrible. Nothing in the
          gospel excuses sin; nothing in it affords toleration for lust or
          anger, or dishonesty, or falsehood. The gospel is as truly a two-edged
          sword against sin, as ever the law can be. There is grace for the man
          who quits his sin, but there is tribulation and wrath upon every man
          that doeth evil. |If ye turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent
          his bow, and made it ready.| The gospel is all tenderness to the
          repenting, but all terror to the obstinate offender. It has pardon for
          the very chief of sinners, and mercy for the vilest of the vile, if
          they will forsake their sins; but it is according to our gospel that
          he that goeth on in his iniquity, shall be cast into hell, and he that
          believeth not shall be damned. With deep love to the souls of men, I
          bear witness to the truth that he who turns not with repentance and
          faith to Christ, shall go away into punishment as everlasting as the
          life of the righteous. This is according to our gospel: indeed, we had
          not needed such a gospel, if there had not been such a judgment. The
          background of the cross is the judgment-seat of Christ. We had not
          needed so great an atonement, so vast a sacrifice, if there had not
          been an exceeding sinfulness in sin, an exceeding justice in the
          judgment, and an exceeding terror in the sure rewards of
          transgression.
        </p>
        <p>
          |According to my gospel,| saith Paul; and he meant that the judgment
          is an essential part of the gospel creed. If I had to sum up the
          gospel I should have to tell you certain facts: Jesus, the Son of God,
          became man; he was born of the virgin Mary; lived a perfect life; was
          falsely accused of men; was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day
          he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven and sitteth on
          the right hand of God; from whence he shall also come to judge the
          quick and the dead. This is one of the elementary truths of our
          gospel; we believe in the resurrection of the dead, the final
          judgment, and the life everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judgment is according to our gospel, and in times of righteous
          indignation its terrible significance seemeth a very gospel to the
          pure in heart. I mean this. I have read this and that concerning
          oppression, slavery, the treading down of the poor, and the shedding
          of blood, and I have rejoiced that there is a righteous Judge. I have
          read of secret wickednesses among the rich men of this city, and I
          have said within myself, |Thank God, there will be a judgment day.|
          Thousands of men have been hanged for much less crimes than those
          which now disgrace gentlemen whose names are on the lips of rank and
          beauty. Ah me, how heavy is our heart as we think of it! It has come
          like a gospel to us that the Lord will be revealed in flaming fire,
          taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the
          gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. (2 Thess.1:8) The secret wickedness
          of London cannot go on for ever. Even they that love men best, and
          most desire salvation for them, cannot but cry to God, |How long! How
          long! Great God, wilt thou for ever endure this?| God hath appointed a
          day in which he will judge the world, and we sigh and cry until it
          shall end the reign of wickedness, and give rest to the oppressed.
          Brethren, we must preach the coming of the Lord, and preach it
          somewhat more than we have done; because it is the driving power of
          the gospel. Too many have kept back these truths, and thus the bone
          has been taken out of the arm of the gospel. Its point has been
          broken; its edge has been blunted. The doctrine of judgment to come is
          the power by which men are to be aroused. There is another life; the
          Lord will come a second time; judgment will arrive; the wrath of God
          will be revealed. Where this is not preached, I am bold to say the
          gospel is not preached. It is absolutely necessary to the preaching of
          the gospel of Christ that men be warned as to what will happen if they
          continue in their sins. Ho, ho, sir surgeon, you are too delicate to
          tell the man that he is ill! You hope to heal the sick without their
          knowing it. You therefore flatter them; and what happens? They laugh
          at you; they dance upon their own graves. At last they die! Your
          delicacy is cruelty; your flatteries are poisons; you are a murderer.
          Shall we keep men in a fool's paradise? Shall we lull them into soft
          slumbers from which they will awake in hell? Are we to become helpers
          of their damnation by our smooth speeches? In the name of God we will
          not. It becomes every true minister of Christ to cry aloud and spare
          not, for God hath set a day in which he will |judge the secrets of men
          by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.| As surely as Paul's gospel
          was true the judgment will come. Wherefore flee to Jesus this day, O
          sinners. O ye saints, come hide yourselves again beneath the crimson
          canopy of the atoning sacrifice, that you may be now ready to welcome
          your descending Lord and escort him to his judgment-seat. O my
          hearers, may God bless you, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
