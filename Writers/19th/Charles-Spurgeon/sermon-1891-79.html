          1. This, therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it
          shall yet be so still more clearly), that neither the prophets, nor
          the apostles, nor the Lord Christ in His own person, did acknowledge
          any other Lord or God, but the God and Lord supreme: the prophets and
          the apostles confessing the Father and the Son; but naming no other as
          God, and confessing no other as Lord: and the Lord Himself handing
          down to His disciples, that He, the Father, is the only God and Lord,
          who alone is God and ruler of all; -- it is incumbent on us to follow,
          if we are their disciples indeed, their testimonies to this effect.
          For Matthew the apostle -- knowing, as one and the same God, Him who
          had given promise to Abraham, that He would make his seed as the stars
          of heaven, and Him who, by His Son Christ Jesus, has called us to the
          knowledge of Himself, from the worship of stones, so that those who
          were not a people were made a people, and she beloved who was not
          beloved -- declares that John, when preparing the way for Christ, said
          to those who were boasting of their relationship [to Abraham]
          according to the flesh, but who had their mind tinged and stuffed with
          all manner of evil, preaching that repentance which should call them
          back from their evil doings, said, |O generation of vipers, who hath
          shown you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruit
          meet for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves, We have
          Abraham [to our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these
          stones to raise up children unto Abraham.| He preached to them,
          therefore, the repentance from wickedness, but he did not declare to
          them another God, besides Him who made the promise to Abraham; he, the
          forerunner of Christ, of whom Matthew again says, and Luke likewise,
          |For this is he that was spoken of from the Lord by the prophet, The
          voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
          make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled, and
          every mountain and hill brought low; and the crooked shall be made
          straight, and the rough into smooth ways; and all flesh shall see the
          salvation of God.| There is therefore one and the same God, the Father
          of our Lord, who also promised, through the prophets, that He would
          send His forerunner; and His salvation -- that is, His Word -- He
          caused to be made visible to all flesh, [the Word] Himself being made
          incarnate, that in all things their King might become manifest. For it
          is necessary that those [beings] which are judged do see the judge,
          and know Him from whom they receive judgment; and it is also proper,
          that those which follow on to glory should know Him who bestows upon
          them the gift of glory.

          2. Then again Matthew, when speaking of the angel, says, |The angel of
          the Lord appeared to Joseph in sleep.| Of what Lord he does himself
          interpret: |That it may be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by
          the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called my son.| |Behold, a virgin
          shall conceive, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his
          name Emmanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us.| David
          likewise speaks of Him who, from the virgin, is Emmanuel: |Turn not
          away the face of Thine anointed. The Lord hath sworn a truth to David,
          and will not turn from him. Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon
          thy seat.| And again: |In Judea is God known; His place has been made
          in peace, and His dwelling in Zion.| Therefore there is one and the
          same God, who was proclaimed by the prophets and announced by the
          Gospel; and His Son, who was of the fruit of David's body, that is, of
          the virgin of [the house of] David, and Emmanuel; whose star also
          Balaam thus prophesied: |There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a
          leader shall rise in Israel.| But Matthew says that the Magi, coming
          from the east, exclaimed |For we have seen His star in the east, and
          are come to worship Him;| and that, having been led by the star into
          the house of Jacob to Emmanuel, they showed, by these gifts which they
          offered, who it was that was worshipped; myrrh, because it was He who
          should die and be buried for the mortal human race; gold, because He
          was a King, |of whose kingdom is no end;| and frankincense, because He
          was God, who also |was made known in Judea,| and was |declared to
          those who sought Him not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And then, [speaking of His] baptism, Matthew says, |The heavens
          were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God, as a dove, coming upon Him:
          and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
          am well pleased.| For Christ did not at that time descend upon Jesus,
          neither was Christ one and Jesus another: but the Word of God -- who
          is the Saviour of all, and the ruler of heaven and earth, who is
          Jesus, as I have already pointed out, who did also take upon Him
          flesh, and was anointed by the Spirit from the Father -- was made
          Jesus Christ, as Esaias also says, |There shall come forth a rod from
          the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise from his root; and the
          Spirit of God shall rest upon Him: the spirit of wisdom and
          understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
          knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of God, shall fill
          Him. He shall not judge according to glory, nor reprove after the
          manner of speech; but He shall dispense judgment to the humble man,
          and reprove the haughty ones of the earth.| And again Esaias, pointing
          out beforehand His unction, and the reason why he was anointed, does
          himself say, |The Spirit of God is upon Me, because He hath anointed
          Me: He hath sent Me to preach the Gospel to the lowly, to heal the
          broken up in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to
          the blind; to announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of
          vengeance; to comfort all that mourn.| For inasmuch as the Word of God
          was man from the root of Jesse, and son of Abraham, in this respect
          did the Spirit of God rest upon Him, and anoint Him to preach the
          Gospel to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was God, He did not judge
          according to glory, nor reprove after the manner of speech. For |He
          needed not that any should testify to Him of man, for He Himself knew
          what was in man.| For He called all men that mourn; and granting
          forgiveness to those who had been led into captivity by their sins, He
          loosed them from their chains, of whom Solomon says, |Every one shall
          be holden with the cords of his own sins.| Therefore did the Spirit of
          God descend upon Him, [the Spirit] of Him who had promised by the
          prophets that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from the
          abundance of His unction, might be saved. Such, then, [is the witness]
          of Matthew.
