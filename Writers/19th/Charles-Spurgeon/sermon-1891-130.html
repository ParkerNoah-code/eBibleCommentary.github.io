          1. A spiritual disciple of this sort truly receiving the Spirit of
          God, who was from the beginning, in all the dispensations of God,
          present with mankind, and announced things future, revealed things
          present, and narrated things past -- [such a man] does indeed |judge
          all men, but is himself judged by no man.| For he judges the Gentiles,
          |who serve the creature more than the Creator,| and with a reprobate
          mind spend all their labour on vanity. And he also judges the Jews,
          who do not accept of the word of liberty, nor are willing to go forth
          free, although they have a Deliverer present [with them]; but they
          pretend, at a time unsuitable [for such conduct], to serve, [with
          observances] beyond [those required by] the law, God who stands in
          need of nothing, and do not recognise the advent of Christ, which He
          accomplished for the salvation of men, nor are willing to understand
          that all the prophets announced His two advents: the one, indeed, in
          which He became a man subject to stripes, and knowing what it is to
          bear infirmity, and sat upon the foal of an ass, and was a stone
          rejected by the builders, and was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and
          by the stretching forth of His hands destroyed Amalek; while He
          gathered from the ends of the earth into His Father's fold the
          children who were scattered abroad, and remembered His own dead ones
          who had formerly fallen asleep, and came down to them that He might
          deliver them: but the second in which He will come on the clouds,
          bringing on the day which burns as a furnace, and smiting the earth
          with the word of His mouth, and slaying the impious with the breath of
          His lips, and having a fan in His hands, and cleansing His floor, and
          gathering the wheat indeed into His barn, but burning the chaff with
          unquenchable fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Moreover, he shall also examine the doctrine of Marcion,
          [inquiring] how he holds that there are two gods, separated from each
          other by an infinite distance. Or how can he be good who draws away
          men that do not belong to him from him who made them, and calls them
          into his own kingdom? And why is his goodness, which does not save all
          [thus], defective? Also, why does he, indeed, seem to be good as
          respects men, but most unjust with regard to him who made men,
          inasmuch as he deprives him of his possessions? Moreover, how could
          the Lord, with any justice, if He belonged to another father, have
          acknowledged the bread to be His body, while He took it from that
          creation to which we belong, and affirmed the mixed cup to be His
          blood? And why did He acknowledge Himself to be the Son of man, if He
          had not gone through that birth which belongs to a human being? How,
          too, could He forgive us those sins for which we are answerable to our
          Maker and God? And how, again, supposing that He was not flesh, but
          was a man merely in appearance, could He have been crucified, and
          could blood and water have issued from His pierced side? What body,
          moreover, was it that those who buried Him consigned to the tomb? And
          what was that which rose again from the dead?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. [This spiritual man] shall also judge all the followers of
          Valentinus, because they do indeed confess with the tongue one God the
          Father, and that all things derive their existence from Him, but do at
          the same time maintain that He who formed all things is the fruit of
          an apostasy or defect. [He shall judge them, too, because] they do in
          like manner confess with the tongue one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
          God, but assign in their [system of] doctrine a production of his own
          to the Only-begotten, one of his own also to the Word, another to
          Christ, and yet another to the Saviour; so that, according to them,
          all these beings are indeed said [in Scripture to be], as it were,
          one; [while they maintain], notwithstanding, that each one of them
          should be understood [to exist] separately [from the rest], and to
          have [had] his own special origin, according to his peculiar
          conjunction. [It appears], then that their tongues alone, forsooth,
          have conceded the unity [of God], while their [real] opinion and their
          understanding (by their habit of investigating profundities) have
          fallen away from [this doctrine of] unity, and taken up the notion of
          manifold deities, -- [this, I say, must appear] when they shall be
          examined by Christ as to the points [of doctrine] which they have
          invented. Him, too, they affirm to have been born at a later period
          than the Pleroma of the Ã†ons, and that His production took place after
          [the occurrence of] a degeneracy or apostasy; and they maintain that,
          on account of the passion which was experienced by Sophia, they
          themselves were brought to the birth. But their own special prophet
          Homer, listening to whom they have invented such doctrines, shall
          himself reprove them, when he expresses himself as follows: --
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>|Hateful to me that man as Hades' gates,</p>
        <p>Who one thing thinks, while he another states.|</p>
        <p>
          [This spiritual man] shall also judge the vain speeches of the
          perverse Gnostics, by showing that they are the disciples of Simon
          Magus.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. He will judge also the Ebionites; [for] how can they be saved
          unless it was God who wrought out their salvation upon earth? Or how
          shall man pass into God, unless God has [first] passed into man? And
          how shall he (man) escape from the generation subject to death, if not
          by means of a new generation, given in a wonderful and unexpected
          manner (but as a sign of salvation) by God -- [I mean] that
          regeneration which flows from the virgin through faith? Or how shall
          they receive adoption from God if they remain in this [kind of]
          generation, which is naturally possessed by man in this world? And how
          could He (Christ) have been greater than Solomon, or greater than
          Jonah, or have been the Lord of David, who was of the same substance
          as they were? How, too, could He have subdued him who was stronger
          than men, who had not only overcome man, but also retained him under
          his power, and conquered him who had conquered, while he set free
          mankind who had been conquered, unless He had been greater than man
          who had thus been vanquished? But who else is superior to, and more
          eminent than, that man who was formed after the likeness of God,
          except the Son of God, after whose image man was created? And for this
          reason He did in these last days exhibit the similitude; [for] the Son
          of God was made man, assuming the ancient production [of His hands]
          into His own nature, as I have shown in the immediately preceding
          book.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. He shall also judge those who describe Christ as [having become
          man] only in [human] opinion. For how can they imagine that they do
          themselves carry on a real discussion, when their Master was a mere
          imaginary being? Or how can they receive anything stedfast from Him,
          if He was a merely imagined being, and not a verity? And how can these
          men really be partaken of salvation, if He in whom they profess to
          believe, manifested Himself as a merely imaginary being? Everything,
          therefore, connected with these men is unreal, and nothing [possessed
          of the character of] truth; and, in these circumstances, it may be
          made a question whether (since, perchance, they themselves in like
          manner are not men, but mere dumb animals) they do not present, in
          most cases, simply a shadow of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. He shall also judge false prophets, who, without having received
          the gift of prophecy from God, and not possessed of the fear of God,
          but either for the sake of vainglory, or with a view to some personal
          advantage, or acting in some other way under the influence of a wicked
          spirit, pretend to utter prophecies, while all the time they lie
          against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. He shall also judge those who give rise to schisms, who are
          destitute of the love of God, and who look to their own special
          advantage rather than to the unity of the Church; and who for trifling
          reasons, or any kind of reason which occurs to them, cut in pieces and
          divide the great and glorious body of Christ, and so far as in them
          lies, [positively] destroy it, -- men who prate of peace while they
          give rise to war, and do in truth strain out a gnat, but swallow a
          camel. For no reformation of so great importance can be effected by
          them, as will compensate for the mischief arising from their schism.
          He shall also judge all those who are beyond the pale of the truth,
          that is, who are outside the Church; but he himself shall be judged by
          no one. For to him all things are consistent: he has a full faith in
          one God Almighty, of whom are all things; and in the Son of God, Jesus
          Christ our Lord, by whom are all things, and in the dispensations
          connected with Him, by means of which the Son of God became man; and a
          firm belief in the Spirit of God, who furnishes us with a knowledge of
          the truth, and has set forth the dispensations of the Father and the
          Son, in virtue of which He dwells with every generation of men,
          according to the will of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. True knowledge is [that which consists in] the doctrine of the
          apostles, and the ancient constitution of the Church throughout all
          the world, and the distinctive manifestation of the body of Christ
          according to the successions of the bishops, by which they have handed
          down that Church which exists in every place, and has come even unto
          us, being guarded and preserved without any forging of Scriptures, by
          a very complete system of doctrine, and neither receiving addition nor
          [suffering] curtailment [in the truths which she believes]; and [it
          consists in] reading [the word of God] without falsification, and a
          lawful and diligent exposition in harmony with the Scriptures, both
          without danger and without blasphemy; and [above all, it consists in]
          the pre-eminent gift of love, which is more precious than knowledge,
          more glorious than prophecy, and which excels all the other gifts [of
          God].
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Wherefore the Church does in every place, because of that love
          which she cherishes towards God, send forward, throughout all time, a
          multitude of martyrs to the Father; while all others not only have
          nothing of this kind to point to among themselves, but even maintain
          that such witness-bearing is not at all necessary, for that their
          system of doctrines is the true witness [for Christ], with the
          exception, perhaps, that one or two among them, during the whole time
          which has elapsed since the Lord appeared on earth, have occasionally,
          along with our martyrs, borne the reproach of the name (as if he too
          [the heretic] had obtained mercy), and have been led forth with them
          [to death], being, as it were, a sort of retinue granted unto them.
          For the Church alone sustains with purity the reproach of those who
          suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, and endure all sorts of
          punishments, and are put to death because of the love which they bear
          to God, and their confession of His Son; often weakened indeed, yet
          immediately increasing her members, and becoming whole again, after
          the same manner as her type, Lot's wife, who became a pillar of salt.
          Thus, too, [she passes through an experience] similar to that of the
          ancient prophets, as the Lord declares, |For so persecuted they the
          prophets who were before you;| inasmuch as she does indeed, in a new
          fashion, suffer persecution from those who do not receive the word of
          God, while the self-same spirit rests upon her [as upon these ancient
          prophets].
        </p>
        <p>
          10. And indeed the prophets, along with other things which they
          predicted, also foretold this, that all those on whom the Spirit of
          God should rest, and who would obey the word of the Father, and serve
          Him according to their ability, should suffer persecution, and be
          stoned and slain. For the prophets prefigured in themselves all these
          things, because of their love to God, and on account of His word. For
          since they themselves were members of Christ, each one of them in his
          place as a member did, in accordance with this, set forth the prophecy
          [assigned him]; all of them, although many, prefiguring only one, and
          proclaiming the things which pertain to one. For just as the working
          of the whole body is exhibited through means of our members, while the
          figure of a complete man is not displayed by one member, but through
          means of all taken together, so also did all the prophets prefigure
          the one [Christ]; while every one of them, in his special place as a
          member, did, in accordance with this, fill up the [established]
          dispensation, and shadowed forth beforehand that particular working of
          Christ which was connected with that member.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. For some of them, beholding Him in glory, saw His glorious life
          (conversationem) at the Father's right hand; others beheld Him coming
          on the clouds as the Son of man; and those who declared regarding Him,
          |They shall look on Him whom they have pierced,| indicated His
          [second] advent, concerning which He Himself says, |Thinkest thou that
          when the Son of man cometh, He shall find faith on the earth?| Paul
          also refers to this event when he says, |If, however, it is a
          righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that
          trouble you, and to you that are troubled rest with us, at the
          revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels, and
          in a flame of fire.| Others again, speaking of Him as a judge, and
          [referring], as if it were a burning furnace, [to] the day of the
          Lord, who |gathers the wheat into His barn, but will burn up the chaff
          with unquenchable fire,| were accustomed to threaten those who were
          unbelieving, concerning whom also the Lord Himself declares, |Depart
          from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father has
          prepared for the devil and his angels.| And the apostle in like manner
          says [of them], |Who shall be punished with everlasting death from the
          face of the Lord, and from the glory of His power, when He shall come
          to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in those who believe
          in Him.| There are also some [of them] who declare, |Thou art fairer
          than the children of men;| and, |God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with
          the oil of gladness above Thy fellows;| and, |Gird Thy sword upon Thy
          thigh, O Most Mighty, with Thy beauty and Thy fairness, and go forward
          and proceed prosperously; and rule Thou because of truth, and
          meekness, and righteousness.| And whatever other things of a like
          nature are spoken regarding Him, these indicated that beauty and
          splendour which exist in His kingdom, along with the transcendent and
          pre-eminent exaltation [belonging] to all who are under His sway, that
          those who hear might desire to be found there, doing such things as
          are pleasing to God. Again, there are those who say, |He is a man, and
          who shall know him?| and, |I came unto the prophetess, and she bare a
          son, and His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God;|
          and those [of them] who proclaimed Him as Immanuel, [born] of the
          Virgin, exhibited the union of the Word of God with His own
          workmanship, [declaring] that the Word should become flesh, and the
          Son of God the Son of man (the pure One opening purely that pure womb
          which regenerates men unto God, and which He Himself made pure); and
          having become this which we also are, He [nevertheless] is the Mighty
          God, and possesses a generation which cannot be declared. And there
          are also some of them who say, |The Lord hath spoken in Zion, and
          uttered His voice from Jerusalem;| and, |In Judah is God known;| --
          these indicated His advent which took place in Judea. Those, again,
          who declare that |God comes from the south, and from a mountain thick
          with foliage,| announced His advent at Bethlehem, as I have pointed
          out in the preceding book. From that place, also, He who rules, and
          who feeds the people of His Father, has come. Those, again, who
          declare that at His coming |the lame man shall leap as an hart, and
          the tongue of the dumb shall [speak] plainly, and the eyes of the
          blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear,| and that
          |the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, shall be
          strengthened,| and that |the dead which are in the grave shall arise,|
          and that He Himself |shall take [upon Him] our weaknesses, and bear
          our sorrows,| -- [all these] proclaimed those works of healing which
          were accomplished by Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Some of them, moreover -- [when they predicted that] as a weak and
          inglorious man, and as one who knew what it was to bear infirmity, and
          sitting upon the foal of an ass, He should come to Jerusalem; and that
          He should give His back to stripes, and His cheeks to palms [which
          struck Him]; and that He should be led as a sheep to the slaughter;
          and that He should have vinegar and gall given Him to drink; and that
          He should be forsaken by His friends and those nearest to Him; and
          that He should stretch forth His hands the whole day long; and that He
          should be mocked and maligned by those who looked upon Him; and that
          His garments should be parted, and lots cast upon His raiment; and
          that He should be brought down to the dust of death with all [the
          other] things of a like nature -- prophesied His coming in the
          character of a man as He entered Jerusalem, in which by His passion
          and crucifixion He endured all the things which have been mentioned.
          Others, again, when they said, |The holy Lord remembered His own dead
          ones who slept in the dust, and came down to them to raise them up,
          that He might save them,| furnished us with the reason on account of
          which He suffered all these things. Those, moreover, who said, |In
          that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall go down at noon, and there
          shall be darkness over the earth in the clear day; and I will turn
          your feast days into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation,|
          plainly announced that obscuration of the sun which at the time of His
          crucifixion took place from the sixth hour onwards, and that after
          this event, those days which were their festivals according to the
          law, and their songs, should be changed into grief and lamentation
          when they were handed over to the Gentiles. Jeremiah, too, makes this
          point still clearer, when he thus speaks concerning Jerusalem: |She
          that hath born [seven] languisheth; her soul hath become weary; her
          sun hath gone down while it was yet noon; she hath been confounded,
          and suffered reproach: the remainder of them will I give to the sword
          in the sight of their enemies.|
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Those of them, again, who spoke of His having slumbered and taken
          sleep, and of His having risen again because the Lord sustained Him,
          and who enjoined the principalities of heaven to set open the
          everlasting doors, that the King of glory might go in, proclaimed
          beforehand His resurrection from the dead through the Father's power,
          and His reception into heaven. And when they expressed themselves
          thus, |His going forth is from the height of heaven, and His returning
          even to the highest heaven; and there is no one who can hide himself
          from His heat,| they announced that very truth of His being taken up
          again to the place from which He came down, and that there is no one
          who can escape His righteous judgment. And those who said, |The Lord
          hath reigned; let the people be enraged: [even] He who sitteth upon
          the cherubim; let the earth be moved,| were thus predicting partly
          that wrath from all nations which after His ascension came upon those
          who believed in Him, with the movement of the whole earth against the
          Church; and partly the fact that, when He comes from heaven with His
          mighty angels, the whole earth shall be shaken, as He Himself
          declares, |There shall be a great earthquake, such as has not been
          from the beginning.| And again, when one says, |Whosoever is judged,
          let him stand opposite; and whosoever is justified, let him draw near
          to the servant of God;| and, |Woe unto you, for ye shall wax old as
          doth a garment, and the moth shall eat you up;| and, |All flesh shall
          be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in the highest,| -- it
          is thus indicated that, after His passion and ascension, God shall
          cast down under His feet all who were opposed to Him, and He shall be
          exalted above all, and there shall be no one who can be justified or
          compared to Him.

          14. And those of them who declare that God would make a new covenant
          with men, not such as that which He made with the fathers at Mount
          Horeb, and would give to men a new heart and a new spirit; and again,
          |And remember ye not the things of old: behold, I make new things
          which shall now arise, and ye shall know it; and I will make a way in
          the desert, and rivers in a dry land, to give drink to my chosen
          people, my people whom I have acquired, that they may show forth my
          praise,| -- plainly announced that liberty which distinguishes the new
          covenant, and the new wine which is put into new bottles, [that is],
          the faith which is in Christ, by which He has proclaimed the way of
          righteousness sprung up in the desert, and the streams of the Holy
          Spirit in a dry land, to give water to the elect people of God, whom
          He has acquired, that they might show forth His praise, but not that
          they might blaspheme Him who made these things, that is, God.

          15. And all those other points which I have shown the prophets to have
          uttered by means of so long a series of Scriptures, he who is truly
          spiritual will interpret by pointing out, in regard to every one of
          the things which have been spoken, to what special point in the
          dispensation of the Lord is referred, and [by thus exhibiting] the
          entire system of the work of the Son of God, knowing always the same
          God, and always acknowledging the same Word of God, although He has
          [but] now been manifested to us; acknowledging also at all times the
          same Spirit of God, although He has been poured out upon us after a
          new fashion in these last times, [knowing that He descends] even from
          the creation of the world to its end upon the human race simply as
          such, from whom those who believe God and follow His word receive that
          salvation which flows from Him. Those, on the other hand, who depart
          from Him, and despise His precepts, and by their deeds bring dishonour
          on Him who made them, and by their opinions blaspheme Him who
          nourishes them, heap up against themselves most righteous judgment. He
          therefore (i.e., the spiritual man) sifts and tries them all, but he
          himself is tried by no man: he neither blasphemes his Father, nor sets
          aside His dispensations, nor inveighs against the fathers, nor
          dishonours the prophets, by maintaining that they were [sent] from
          another God [than he worships], or again, that their prophecies were
          derived from different sources. <br />
