        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.504)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, April 12th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the
          latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this
          body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself,
          and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be
          consumed within me.| -- Job 19:25-27.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE HAND OF GOD has been upon us heavily this week. An aged deacon,
          who has been for more than fifty years a member of this Church, has
          been removed from our midst; and a sister, the beloved wife of another
          of our Church-officers, a member for nearly the same term of years,
          has fallen asleep. It is not often that a Church is called to sorrow
          over the departure of two such venerable members -- let not our ears
          be deaf to such a double admonition to prepare to meet our God. That
          they were preserved so long, and upheld so mercifully for so many
          years, was not only a reason for gratitude to them, but to us also. I
          am, however, so averse to the preaching of what are called funeral
          sermons, that I forbear, lest I appear to eulogize the creature, when
          my only aim should be to magnify the grace of God.
        </p>

          Our text deserves our profound attention; its preface would hardly
          have been written had not the matter been of the utmost importance in
          the judgment of the patriarch who uttered it. Listen to Job's
          remarkable desire: |Oh that my words were now written! oh that they
          were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and
          lead in the rock for ever!| Perhaps, hardly aware of the full meaning
          of the words he was uttering, yet his holy soul was impressed with a
          sense of some weighty revelation concealed within his words; he
          therefore desired that it might be recorded in a book; he has had his
          desire: the Book of books embalms the words of Job. He wished to have
          them graven on a rock; cut deep into it with an iron pen, and then the
          lines inlaid with lead; or he would have them engraven, according to
          the custom of the ancients, upon a sheet of metal, so that time might
          not be able to eat out the inscription. He has not had his desire in
          that respect, save only that upon many and many a sepulchre those
          words of Job stand recorded, |I know that my redeemer liveth.| It is
          the opinion of some commentators that Job, in speaking of the rock
          here, intended his own rock-hewn sepulchre, and desired that this
          might be his epitaph; that it might be cut deep, so that ages should
          not wear it out; that when any asked, |Where does Job sleep?| as soon
          as they saw the sepulchre of the patriarch of Uz, they might learn
          that he died in hope of resurrection, resting upon a living Redeemer.
          Whether such a sentence adorned the portals of Job's last
          sleeping-place we know not; but certainly no words could have been
          more fitly chosen. Should not the man of patience, the mirror of
          endurance, the pattern of trust, bear as his memorial this golden
          line, which is as full of all the patience of hope, and hope of
          patience, as mortal language can be? Who among us could select a more
          glorious motto for his last escutcheon? I am sorry to say that a few
          of those who have written upon this passage cannot see Christ or the
          resurrection in it at all. Albert Barnes, among the rest, expresses
          his intense sorrow that he cannot find the resurrection here, and for
          my part I am sorry for him. If it had been Job's desire to foretell
          the advent of Christ and his own sure resurrection, I cannot see what
          better words he could have used; and if those truths are not here
          taught, then language must have lost its original object, and must
          have been employed to mystify and not to explain; to conceal and not
          to reveal. What I ask, does the patriarch mean, if not that he shall
          rise again when the Redeemer stands upon the earth? Brethren, no
          unsophisticated mind can fail to find here what almost all believers
          have here discovered. I feel safe in keeping to the old sense, and we
          shall this morning seek no new interpretation, but adhere to the
          common one, with or without the consent of our critics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In discoursing upon them I shall speak upon three things. First, let
          us, with the patriarch, descend into the grave and behold the ravages
          of death. Then, with him, let us look up on high for present
          consolation. And, still in his admirable company, let us, in the third
          place, anticipate future delights.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all then, with the patriarch of Uz, LET US DESCEND INTO
          THE SEPULCHRE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The body has just been divorced from the soul. Friends who loved most
          tenderly have said -- |Bury my dead out of my sight.| The body is
          borne upon the bier and consigned to the silent earth; it is
          surrounded by the earthworks of death. Death has a host of troops. If
          the locusts and the caterpillars be God's army, the worms are the army
          of death. These hungry warriors begin to attack the city of man. They
          commence with the outworks; they storm the munition, and overturn the
          walls. The skin, the city wall of manhood, is utterly broken down, and
          the towers of its glory covered with confusion. How speedily the cruel
          invaders deface all beauty. The face gathers blackness; the
          countenance is defiled with corruption. Those cheeks once fair with
          youth, and ruddy with health, have fallen in, even as a bowing wall
          and a tottering fence; those eyes, the windows of the mind whence joy
          and sorrow looked forth by turns, are now filled up with the dust of
          death; those lips, the doors of the soul, the gates of Mansoul, are
          carried away, and the bars thereof are broken. Alas, ye windows of
          agates and gates of carbuncle, where are ye now? How shall I mourn for
          thee, O thou captive city, for the mighty men have utterly spoiled
          thee! Thy neck, once like a tower of ivory, has become as a fallen
          column; thy nose, so lately comparable to |the tower of Lebanon, which
          looketh toward Damascus,| is as a ruined hovel; and thy head, which
          towered like Carmel, lies low as the clods of the valley. Where is
          beauty now? The most lovely cannot be known from the most deformed.
          The vessel so daintily wrought upon the potter's wheel, is cast away
          upon the dunghill with the vilest potsherds. Cruel have ye been, ye
          warriors of death, for though ye wield no axes and bear no hammers,
          yet have ye broken down the carved work; and though ye speak not with
          tongues, yet have ye said in your hearts, |We have swallowed her up,
          certainly this is the day that we have looked for; we have found, we
          have seen it.| The skin is gone. The troops have entered into the town
          of Mansoul. And now they pursue their work of devastation; the
          pitiless marauders fall upon the body itself. There are those noble
          aqueducts, the veins through which the streams of life were wont to
          flow, these, instead of being rivers of life, have become blocked up
          with the soil and wastes of death, and now they must be pulled to
          pieces; not a single relic of them shall be spared. Mark the muscles
          and sinews, like great highways that penetrating the metropolis, carry
          the strength and wealth of manhood along -- their curious pavement
          must be pulled up, and they that do traffic thereon must be consumed;
          each tunnelled bone, and curious arch, and knotted bond must be
          snapped and broken. Fair fabrics, glorious storehouses, costly
          engines, wonderful machines -- all, all must be pulled down, and not
          one stone left upon another. Those nerves, which like telegraphic
          wires connected all parts of the city together, to carry thought and
          feeling and intelligence -- these are cut. No matter how artistic the
          work might be, -- and certainly we are fearfully and wonderfully made,
          and the anatomist stands still and marvels to see the skill which the
          eternal God has manifested in the formation of the body -- but these
          ruthless worms pull everything to pieces, till like a city sacked and
          spoiled that has been given up for days to pillage and to flame,
          everything lies in a heap of ruin -- ashes to ashes, dust to dust. But
          these invaders stop not here. Job says that next they consume his
          reins. We are wont to speak of the heart as the great citadel of life,
          the inner keep and donjon, where the captain of the guard holdeth out
          to the last. The Hebrews do not regard the heart, but the lower
          viscera, the reins, as the seat of the passions and of mental power.
          The worms spare not; they enter the secret palaces of the tabernacle
          of life, and the standard is plucked from the tower. Having died, the
          heart cannot preserve itself, and falls like the rest of the frame --
          a prey to worms. It is gone, it is all gone! The skin, the body, the
          vitals, all, all has departed. There is nought left. In a few years ye
          shall turn up the sod and say, |Here slept so-and-so, and where is he
          now?|, and ye may search and hunt and dig, but ye shall find no relic.
          Mother Earth has devoured her own offspring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, why should we wish to have it otherwise? Why should we
          desire to preserve the body when the soul has gone? What vain attempts
          men have made with coffins of lead, and wrappings of myrrh and
          frankincense. The embalming of the Egyptians, those master robbers of
          the worm, what has it done? It has served to keep some poor shrivelled
          lumps of mortality above ground to be sold for curiosities, to be
          dragged away to foreign climes, and stared upon by thoughtless eyes.
          No, let the dust go, the sooner it dissolves the better. And what
          matters it how it goes! If it be devoured of beasts, if it be
          swallowed up in the sea and become food for fishes! What, if plants
          with their roots suck up the particles! What, if the fabric passes
          into the animal, and from the animal into the earth, and from the
          plant into the animal again! What, if the winds blow it along the
          highway! What, if the rivers carry it to the waves of ocean! It is
          ordained that somehow or other it must be all separated -- |dust to
          dust, ashes to ashes.| It is part of the decree that it should all
          perish. The worms or some other agents of destruction must destroy
          this body. Do not seek to avoid what God has purposed; do not look
          upon it as a gloomy thing. Regard it as a necessity; nay more, view it
          as the platform of a miracle, the lofty stage of resurrection, since
          Jesus shall surely raise again from the dead the particles of this
          body, however divided from one another. We have heard of miracles, but
          what a miracle is the resurrection! All the miracles of Scripture, yea
          even those wrought by Christ, are small compared with this. The
          philosopher says, |How is it possible that God shall hunt out every
          particle of the human frame?| He can do it: he has but to speak the
          word, and every single atom, though it may have traveled thousands of
          leagues, though it may have been blown as dust across the desert, and
          anon have fallen upon the bosom of the sea, and then have descended
          into the depths thereof to be cast up on a desolate shore, sucked up
          by plants, fed on again by beasts, or passed into the fabric of
          another man, -- I say that individual atom shall find its fellows, and
          the whole company of particles at the trump of the archangel shall
          travel to their appointed place, and the body, the very body which was
          laid in the ground, shall rise again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am afraid I have been somewhat uninteresting while tarrying upon the
          exposition of the words of Job, but I think very much of the pith of
          Job's faith lay in this, that he had a clear view that the worms would
          after his skin destroy his body, and yet that in his flesh he should
          see God. You know we might regard it as a small miracle if we could
          preserve the bodies of the departed. If, by some process, with spices
          and gums we could preserve the particles, for the Lord to make those
          dry bones live, and to quicken that skin and flesh, were a miracle
          certainly, but not palpably and plainly so great a marvel as when the
          worms have destroyed the body. When the fabric has been absolutely
          broken up, the tenement all pulled down, ground to pieces, and flung
          in handfuls to the wind, so that no relic of it is left, and yet when
          Christ stands in the latter days upon the earth, all the structure
          shall be brought together, bone to his bone -- then shall the might of
          Omnipotence be seen. This is the doctrine of the resurrection, and
          happy is he who finds no difficulty here, who looks at it as being an
          impossibility with man but a possibility with God, and lays hold upon
          the omnipotence of the Most High and says, |Thou sayest it, and it
          shall be done!| I comprehend thee not, great God; I marvel at thy
          purpose to raise my moldering bones: but I know that thou doest great
          wonders, and I am not surprised that thou shouldst conclude the great
          drama of thy creating works here on earth by re-creating the human
          frame by the same power by which thou didst bring from the dead the
          body of thy Son Jesus Christ, and by that same divine energy which has
          regenerated human souls in thine own image.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, having thus descended into the grave, and seen nothing there
          but what is loathsome, LET US LOOK UP WITH THE PATRIARCH AND BEHOLD A
          SUN SHINING WITH PRESENT COMFORT.
        </p>
        <p>
          |I know,| said he, |that my Redeemer liveth.| The word |Redeemer| here
          used, is in the original |goel| -- kinsman. The duty of the kinsman,
          or goel, was this: suppose an Israelite had alienated his estate, as
          in the case of Naomi and Ruth; suppose a patrimony which had belonged
          to a family, had passed away through poverty, it was the goel's
          business, the redeemer's business to pay the price as the next of kin,
          and to buy back the heritage. Boaz stood in that relation to Ruth.
          Now, the body may be looked upon as the heritage of the soul -- the
          soul's small farm, that little plot of earth in which the soul has
          been wont to walk and delight, as a man walketh in his garden or
          dwelleth in his house. Now, that becomes alienated. Death, like Ahab,
          takes away the vineyard from us who are as Naboth; we lose our
          patrimonial estate; Death sends his troops to take our vineyard and to
          spoil the vines thereof and ruin it. But we turn round to Death and
          say, |I know that my Goel liveth, and he will redeem this heritage; I
          have lost it; thou takest it from me lawfully, O Death, because my sin
          hath forfeited my right; I have lost my heritage through my own
          offence, and through that of my first parent Adam; but there lives one
          who will buy this back.| Brethren, Job could say this of Christ long
          before he had descended upon earth, |I know that he liveth;| and now
          that he has ascended up on high, and led captivity captive, surely we
          may with double emphasis say, |I know that my Goel, my Kinsman liveth,
          and that he hath paid the price, that I should have back my patrimony,
          so that in my flesh I shall see God.| Yes, my hands, ye are redeemed
          with blood; bought not with corruptible things, as with silver and
          gold, but with the precious blood of Christ. Yes, heaving lungs and
          palpitating heart, ye have been redeemed! He that redeemed the soul to
          be his altar has also redeemed the body, that it may be a temple for
          the Holy Ghost. Not even the bones of Joseph can remain in the house
          of bondage. No smell of the fire of death may pass upon the garments
          which his holy children have worn in the furnace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that it was always considered to be the duty of the
          goel, not merely to redeem by price, but where that failed, to re-
          deem by power. Hence, when Lot was carried away captive by the four
          kings, Abraham summoned his own hired servants, and the servants of
          all his friends, and went out against the kings of the East, and
          brought back Lot and the captives of Sodom. Now, our Lord Jesus
          Christ, who once has played the kinsman's part by paying the price for
          us, liveth, and he will redeem us by power. O Death, thou tremblest at
          this name! Thou knowest the might of our Kinsman! Against his arm thou
          canst not stand! Thou didst once meet him foot to foot in stern
          battle, and O Death, thou didst indeed tread upon his heel. He
          voluntarily submitted to this, or else, O Death, thou hadst no power
          against him. But he slew thee, Death, he slew thee! He rifled all thy
          caskets, took from thee the key of thy castle, burst open the door of
          thy dungeon; and now, thou knowest, Death, thou hast no power to hold
          my body; thou mayst set thy slaves to devour it, but thou shalt give
          it up, and all their spoil must be restored. Insatiable Death, from
          thy greedy maw yet shall return the multitudes whom thou hast
          devoured. Thou shalt be compelled by the Saviour to restore thy
          captives to the light of day. I think I see Jesus coming with his
          Father's servants. The chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand, even
          thousands of angels. Blow ye the trumpet! blow ye the trumpet!
          Immanuel rides to battle! The Most Mighty in majesty girds on his
          sword. He comes! He comes to snatch by power, his people's lands from
          those who have invaded their portion. Oh, how glorious the victory! No
          battle shall there be. He comes, he sees, he conquers. The sound of
          the trumpet shall be enough; Death shall fly affrighted; and at once
          from beds of dust and silent clay, to realms of everlasting day the
          righteous shall arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          To linger here a moment, there was yet, very conspicuously in the Old
          Testament, we are informed, a third duty of the goel, which was to
          avenge the death of his friend. If a person had been slain, the Goel
          was the avenger of blood; snatching up his sword, he at once pursued
          the person who had been guilty of bloodshed. So now, let us picture
          ourselves as being smitten by Death. His arrow has just pierced us to
          the heart, but in the act of expiring, our lips are able to boast of
          vengeance, and in the face of the monster we cry, |I know that my Goel
          liveth.| Thou mayst fly, O Death, as rapidly as thou wilt, but no city
          of refuge can hide thee from him; he will overtake thee; he will lay
          hold upon thee, O thou skeleton monarch, and he will avenge my blood
          on thee. I would that I had powers of eloquence to work out this
          magnificent thought. Chrysostom, or Christmas Evans could picture the
          flight of the King of Terrors, the pursuit by the Redeemer, the
          overtaking of the foe, and the slaying of the destroyer. Christ shall
          certainly avenge himself on Death for all the injury which Death hath
          done to his beloved kinsmen. Comfort thyself then, O Christian; thou
          hast ever living, even when thou diest, one who avenges thee, one who
          has paid the price for thee, and one whose strong arms shall yet set
          thee free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing on in our text to notice the next word, it seems that Job
          found consolation not only in the fact that he had a Goel, a Redeemer,
          but that this Redeemer liveth. He does not say, |I know that my Goel
          shall live, but that he lives,| -- having a clear view of the
          self-existence of the Lord Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
          and forever. And you and I looking back do not say, |I know that he
          did live, but he lives today.| This very day you that mourn and sorrow
          for venerated friends, your prop and pillar in years gone by, you may
          go to Christ with confidence, because he not only lives, but he is the
          source of life; and you therefore believe that he can give forth out
          of himself life to those whom you have committed to the tomb. He is
          the Lord and giver of life originally, and he shall be specially
          declared to be the resurrection and the life, when the legions of his
          redeemed shall be glorified with him. If I saw no fountain from which
          life could stream to the dead, I would yet believe the promise when
          God said that the dead shall live; but when I see the fountain
          provided, and know that it is full to the brim and that it runneth
          over, I can rejoice without trembling. Since there is one who can say,
          |I am the Resurrection and the Life,| it is a blessed thing to see the
          means already before us in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us
          look up to our Goel then who liveth at this very time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still the marrow of Job's comfort it seems to me lay in that little
          word |My.| |I know that MY Redeemer liveth.| Oh, to get hold of
          Christ! I know that in his offices he is precious. But, dear friends,
          we must get a property in him before we call really enjoy him. What is
          honey in the wood to me, if like the fainting Israelites, I dare not
          eat. It is honey in my hand, honey on my lip, which enlightens mine
          eyes like those of Jonathan. What is gold in the mine to me? Men are
          beggars in Peru, and beg their bread in California. It is gold in my
          purse which will satisfy my necessities, purchasing the bread I need.
          So, what is a kinsman if he be not a kinsman to me? A Redeemer that
          does not redeem me, an avenger who will never stand up for my blood,
          of what avail were such? But Job's faith was strong and firm in the
          conviction that the Redeemer was his. Dear friends, dear friends, can
          all of you say, |I know that my Redeemer liveth.| The question is
          simple and simply put; but oh, what solemn things hang upon your
          answer, |Is it MY Redeemer?| I charge you rest not, be not content
          until by faith you can say, |Yes, I cast myself upon him; I am his,
          and therefore he is mine.| I know that full many of you, while you
          look upon all else that you have as not being yours, yet can say, |My
          Redeemer is mine.| He is the only piece of property which is really
          ours. We borrow all else, the house, the children, nay, our very body
          we must return to the Great Lender. But Jesus, we can never leave, for
          even when we are absent form the body we are present with the Lord,
          and I know that even death cannot separate us from him, so that body
          and soul are with Jesus truly even in the dark hours of death, in the
          long night of the sepulchre, and in the separate state of spiritual
          existence. Beloved, have you Christ? It may be you hold him with a
          feeble hand, you half think it is presumption to say, |He is my
          Redeemer;| yet remember, if you have but faith as a grain of mustard
          seed, that little faith entitles you to say, and say now, |I know that
          my Redeemer liveth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another word in this consoling sentence which no doubt served
          to give a zest to the comfort of Job. It was that he could say, |I
          KNOW| -- |I KNOW that my Redeemer liveth.| To say, |I hope so, I trust
          so,| is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who
          hardly ever get much further. But to reach the marrow of consolation
          you must say, |I KNOW.| Ifs, buts, and perhapses, are sure murderers
          of peace and comfort. Doubts are dreary things in times of sorrow.
          Like wasps they sting the soul! If I have any suspicion that Christ is
          not mine, then there is vinegar mingled with the gall of death. But if
          I know that Jesus is mine, then darkness is not dark; even the night
          is light about me. Out of the lion cometh honey; out of the eater
          cometh forth sweetness. |I know that my Redeemer liveth.| This is a
          brightly-burning lamp cheering the damps of the sepulchral vault, but
          a feeble hope is like a flickering smoking flax, just making darkness
          visible, but nothing more. I would not like to die with a mere hope
          mingled with suspicion. I might be safe with this but hardly happy;
          but oh, to go down into the river knowing that all is well, confident
          that as a guilty, weak, and helpless worm I have - fallen into the
          arms of Jesus, and believing that he is able to keep that which I have
          committed to him. I would have you, dear Christian friends, never look
          upon the full assurance of faith as a thing impossible to you. Say
          not, |It is too high; I cannot attain unto it.| I have known one or
          two saints of God who have rarely doubted their interest at all. There
          are many of us who do not often enjoy any ravishing ecstacies, but on
          the other hand we generally maintain the even tenor of our way, simply
          hanging upon Christ, feeling that his promise is true, that his merits
          are sufficient, and that we are safe. Assurance is a jewel for worth
          but not for rarity. It is the common privilege of all the saints if
          they have but the grace to attain unto it, and this grace the Holy
          Spirit gives freely. Surely if Job in Arabia, in those dark misty ages
          when there was only the morning star and not the sun, when they saw
          but little when life and immortality had not been brought to light, --
          if Job before the coming and advent still could say, |I know,| you and
          I should not speak less positively. God forbid that our positiveness
          should be presumption. Let us try ourselves, and see that our marks
          and evidences are right, lest we form an ungrounded hope; for nothing
          can be more destructive than to say, |Peace, peace, where there is no
          peace.| But oh, let us build for eternity, and build solidly. Let us
          not be satisfied with the mere foundation, for it is from the upper
          rooms that we get the widest prospect. Let us pray the Lord to help us
          to pile stone on stone, until we are able to say as we look at it,
          |Yes, I know, I KNOW that my Redeemer liveth.| This, then, for present
          comfort today in the prospect of departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the third and last place, as THE ANTICIPATION OF
          FUTURE DELIGHT, let me call to your remembrance the other part of the
          text. Job not only knew that the Redeemer lived, but he anticipated
          the time when he should stand in the latter day upon the earth. No
          doubt Job referred here to our Saviour's first advent, to the time
          when Jesus Christ, |the goel,| the kinsman, should stand upon the
          earth to pay in the blood of his veins the ransom price, which had,
          indeed, in bond and stipulation been paid before the foundation of the
          world in promise. But I cannot think that Job's vision stayed there;
          he was looking forward to the second advent of Christ as being the
          period of the resurrection. We cannot endorse the theory that Job
          arose from the dead when our Lord died, although certain Jewish
          believers held this idea very firmly at one time. We are persuaded
          that |the latter day| refers to the advent of glory rather than to
          that of shame. Our hope is that the Lord shall come to reign in glory
          where he once died in agony. The bright and hallowed doctrine of the
          second advent has been greatly revived in our churches in these latter
          days, and I look for the best results in consequence. There is always
          a danger lest it be perverted and turned by fanatical minds, by
          prophetic speculations, into an abuse; but the doctrine in itself is
          one of the most consoling, and, at the same time, one of the most
          practical, tending to keep the Christian awake, because the bridegroom
          cometh at such an hour as we think not. Beloved, we believe that the
          same Jesus who ascended from Olivet shall so come in like manner as he
          ascended up into heaven. We believe in his personal advent and reign.
          We believe and expect that when both wise and foolish virgins shall
          slumber; in the night when sleep is heavy upon the saints; when men
          shall be eating and drinking as in the days of Noah, that suddenly as
          the lightning flasheth from hea- ven, so Christ shall descend with a
          shout, and the dead in Christ shall rise and reign with him. We are
          looking forward to the literal, personal and actual standing of Christ
          upon earth as the time when creation's groans shall be silenced
          forever, and the earnest expectation of the creature shall be
          fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, that Job describes Christ as standing. Some interpreters have
          read the passage, |he shall stand in the latter days against the
          earth;| that as the earth has covered up the slain, as the earth has
          become the charnel-house of the dead, Jesus shall arise to the contest
          and say, |Earth, I am against thee; give up thy dead! Ye clods of the
          valley cease to be custodians of my people's bodies! Silent deeps, and
          you, ye caverns of the earth, deliver, once for all, those whom ye
          have imprisoned!| Macphelah shall give up its precious treasure,
          cemeteries and graveyards shall release their captives, and all the
          deep places of the earth shall resign the bodies of the faithful.
          Well, whether that be so or no, the posture of Christ, in standing
          upon the earth, is significant. It shows his triumph. He has triumphed
          over sin, which once like a serpent in its coils had bound the earth.
          He has defeated Satan. On the very spot where Satan gained his power
          Christ has gained the victory. Earth, which was a scene of defeated
          goodness, whence mercy once was all but driven, where virtue died,
          where everything heavenly and pure, like flowers blasted by
          pestilential winds, hung down their heads, withered and blighted -- on
          this very earth everything that is glorious shall blow and blossom in
          perfection; and Christ himself, once despised and rejected of men,
          fairest of all the sons of men, shall come in the midst of a crowd of
          courtiers, while kings and princes shall do him homage, and all the
          nations shall call him blessed. |He shall stand in the latter day upon
          the earth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, at that auspicious hour, says Job, |In my flesh I shall see
          God.| Oh, blessed anticipation -- |I shall see God.| He does not say,
          |I shall see the saints| -- doubtless we shall see them all in heaven
          -- but, |I shall see God.| Note he does not say, |I shall see the
          pearly gates, I shall see the walls of jasper, I shall see the crowns
          of gold and the harps of harmony,| but |I shall see God;| as if that
          were the sum and substance of heaven. |In my flesh shall I see God.|
          The pure in heart shall see God. It was their delight to see him in
          the ordinances by faith. They delighted to behold him in communion and
          in prayer. There in heaven they shall have a vision of another sort.
          We shall see God in heaven, and be made completely like him; the
          divine character shall be stamped upon us; and being made like to him
          we shall be perfectly satisfied and content. Likeness to God, what can
          we wish for more? And a sight of God, what can we desire better? We
          shall see God and so there shall be perfect contentment to the soul
          and a satisfaction of all the faculties. Some read the passage, |Yet,
          I shall see God in my flesh,| and hence think that there is here an
          allusion to Christ, our Lord Jesus Christ, as the word made flesh.
          Well, be it so, or be it not so, it is certain that we shall see
          Christ, and He, as the divine Redeemer, shall be the subject of our
          eternal vision. Nor shall we ever want any joy beyond simply that of
          seeing him. Think not, dear friend, that this will be a narrow sphere
          for our mind to dwell in. It is but one source of delight, |I shall
          see God,| but that source is infinite. His wisdom, his love, his
          power, all his attributes shall be subjects for your eternal
          contemplation, and as he is infinite under each aspect there is no
          fear of exhaustion. His works, his purposes, his gifts, his love to
          you, and his glory in all his purposes, and in all his deeds of love
          -- why, these shall make a theme that never can be exhausted. You may
          with divine delight anticipate the time when in your flesh you shall
          see God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must have you observe how Job has expressly made us note that it
          is in the same body. |Yet, in my flesh shall I see God;| and then he
          says again, |whom I shall see for myself, and mine eye shall behold
          and not another.| Yes, it is true that I, the very man standing here,
          though I must go down to die, yet I shall as the same man most
          certainly arise and shall behold my God. Not part of myself, though
          the soul alone shall have some view of God, but the whole of myself,
          my flesh, my soul, my body, my spirit shall gaze on God. We shall not
          enter heaven, dear friends, as a dismasted vessel is tugged into
          harbor; we shall not get to glory some on boards, and some on broken
          pieces of the ship, but the whole ship shall be floated safely into
          the haven, body and soul both being safe. Christ shall be able to say,
          |All that the father giveth to me shall come to me,| not only all the
          persons, but all of the persons -- each man in his perfection. There
          shall not be found in heaven one imperfect saint. There shall not be a
          saint without an eye, much less a saint without a body. No member of
          the body shall have perished; nor shall the body have lost any of its
          natural beauty. All the saints shall be all there, and all of all; the
          same persons precisely, only that they shall have risen from a state
          of grace to a state of glory. They shall be ripened; they shall be no
          more the green blades, but the full corn in the ear; no more buds but
          flowers; not babes but men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please to notice, and then I shall conclude, how the patriarch puts it
          as being a real personal enjoyment. |Whom mine eye shall behold, and
          not another.| They shall not bring me a report as they did the Queen
          of Sheba, but I shall see Solomon the King for myself. I shall be able
          to say, as they did who spake to the woman of Samaria, |Now I believe,
          not because of thy word who did bring me a report, but I have seen him
          for myself.| There shall be personal intercourse with God; not through
          the Book, which is but as a glass; not through the ordinances; but
          directly, in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be able to
          commune with the Deity as a man talketh with his friend. |Not
          another.| If I could be a changeling and could be altered, that would
          mar my comfort. Or if my heaven must be enjoyed by proxy, if draughts
          of bliss must be drunk for me, where were the hope? Oh, no; for
          myself, and not through another, shall I see God. Have we not told you
          a hundred times that nothing but personal religion will do, and is not
          this another argument for it, because resurrection and glory are
          personal things? |Not another.| If you could have sponsors to repent
          for you, then, depend upon it, you would have sponsors to be glorified
          for you. But as there is not another to see God for you, so you must
          yourself see and yourself find an interest in the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In closing let me observe how foolish have you and I been when we have
          looked forward to death with shudders, with doubts, with loathings.
          After all, what is it? Worms! Do ye tremble at those base crawling
          things? Scattered particles! Shall we be alarmed at these? To meet the
          worms we have the angels; and to gather the scattered particles we
          have the voice of God. I am sure the gloom of death is altogether gone
          now that the lamp of resurrection burns. Disrobing is nothing now that
          better garments await us. We may long for evening to undress, that we
          may rise with God. I am sure my venerable friends now present, in
          coming so near as they do now to the time of the departure, must have
          some visions of the glory on the other side the stream. Bunyan was not
          wrong, my dear brethren, when he put the land Beulah at the close of
          the pilgrimage. Is not my text a telescope which will enable you to
          see across the Jordan; may it not be as hands of angels to bring you
          bundles of myrrh and frankincense? You can say, |I know that my
          Redeemer liveth.| You cannot want more; you were not satisfied with
          less in your youth, you will not be content with less now. Those of us
          who are young, are comforted by the thought that we may soon depart. I
          say comforted, not alarmed by it; and we almost envy those whose race
          is nearly run, because we fear -- and yet we must not speak thus, for
          the Lord's will be done -- I was about to say, we fear that our battle
          may last long, and that mayhap our feet may slip; only he that keepeth
          Israel does not slumber nor sleep. So since we know that our Redeemer
          liveth, this shall be our comfort in life, that though we fall we
          shall not be utterly cast down; and since our Redeemer liveth, this
          shall be our comfort in death, that though worms destroy this body,
          yet in our flesh we shall see God.
        </p>
        <p>
          May the Lord add his blessing on the feeble words of this morning, and
          to him be glory forever. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>Grave, the guardian of our dust!</p>
        <p>Grave, the treasury of the skies!</p>
        <p>Every atom of thy trust</p>
        <p>Rests in hope again to rise.</p>
        <p>Hark! the judgment trumpet calls;</p>
        <p>Soul, rebuild thy house of clay,</p>
        <p>Immortality thy walls,</p>
        <p>And Eternity thy day.<br /></p>
