          1. The Apostle Paul has, moreover, in the most lucid manner, pointed
          out that man has been delivered over to his own infirmity, lest, being
          uplifted, he might fall away from the truth. Thus he says in the
          second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: |And lest I should be lifted up
          by the sublimity of the revelations, there was given unto me a thorn
          in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. And upon this I
          besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me. But he
          said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is made
          perfect in weakness. Gladly therefore shall I rather glory in
          infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.| What,
          therefore? (as some may exclaim:) did the Lord wish, in that case,
          that His apostles should thus undergo buffeting, and that he should
          endure such infirmity? Even so it was; the word says it. For strength
          is made perfect in weakness, rendering him a better man who by means
          of his infirmity becomes acquainted with the power of God. For how
          could a man have learned that he is himself an infirm being, and
          mortal by nature, but that God is immortal and powerful, unless he had
          learned by experience what is in both? For there is nothing evil in
          learning one's infirmities by endurance; yea, rather, it has even the
          beneficial effect of preventing him from forming an undue opinion of
          his own nature (non aberrare in natura sua). But the being lifted up
          against God, and taking His glory to one's self, rendering man
          ungrateful, has brought much evil upon him. [And thus, I say, man must
          learn both things by experience], that he may not be destitute of
          truth and love either towards himself or his Creator. But the
          experience of both confers upon him the true knowledge as to God and
          man, and increases his love towards God. Now, where there exists an
          increase of love, there a greater glory is wrought out by the power of
          God for those who love Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those men, therefore, set aside the power of God, and do not
          consider what the word declares, when they dwell upon the infirmity of
          the flesh, but do not take into consideration the power of Him who
          raises it up from the dead. For if He does not vivify what is mortal,
          and does not bring back the corruptible to incorruption, He is not a
          God of power. But that He is powerful in all these respects, we ought
          to perceive from our origin, inasmuch as God, taking dust from the
          earth, formed man. And surely it is much more difficult and
          incredible, from non-existent bones, and nerves, and veins, and the
          rest of man's organization, to bring it about that all this should be,
          and to make man an animated and rational creature, than to reintegrate
          again that which had been created and then afterwards decomposed into
          earth (for the reasons already mentioned), having thus passed into
          those [elements] from which man, who had no previous existence, was
          formed. For He who in the beginning caused him to have being who as
          yet was not, just when He pleased, shall much more reinstate again
          those who had a former existence, when it is His will [that they
          should inherit] the life granted by Him. And that flesh shall also be
          found fit for and capable of receiving the power of God, which at the
          beginning received the skilful touches of God; so that one part became
          the eye for seeing; another, the ear for hearing; another, the hand
          for feeling and working; another, the sinews stretched out everywhere,
          and holding the limbs together; another, arteries and veins, passages
          for the blood and the air; another, the various internal organs;
          another, the blood, which is the bond of union between soul and body.
          But why go [on in this strain]? Numbers would fail to express the
          multiplicity of parts in the human frame, which was made in no other
          way than by the great wisdom of God. But those things which partake of
          the skill and wisdom of God, do also partake of His power.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The flesh, therefore, is not destitute [of participation] in the
          constructive wisdom and power of God. But if the power of Him who is
          the bestower of life is made perfect in weakness -- that is, in the
          flesh -- let them inform us, when they maintain the incapacity of
          flesh to receive the life granted by God, whether they do say these
          things as being living men at present, and partakers of life, or
          acknowledge that, having no part in life whatever, they are at the
          present moment dead men. And if they really are dead men, how is it
          that they move about, and speak, and perform those other functions
          which are not the actions of the dead, but of the living? But if they
          are now alive, and if their whole body partakes of life, how can they
          venture the assertion that the flesh is not qualified to be a partaker
          of life, when they do confess that they have life at the present
          moment? It is just as if anybody were to take up a sponge full of
          water, or a torch on fire, and to declare that the sponge could not
          possibly partake of the water, or the torch of the fire. In this very
          manner do those men, by alleging that they are alive and bear life
          about in their members, contradict themselves afterwards, when they
          represent these members as not being capable of [receiving] life. But
          if the present temporal life, which is of such an inferior nature to
          eternal life, can nevertheless effect so much as to quicken our mortal
          members, why should not eternal life, being much more powerful than
          this, vivify the flesh, which has already held converse with, and been
          accustomed to sustain, life? For that the flesh can really partake of
          life, is shown from the fact of its being alive; for it lives on, as
          long as it is God's purpose that it should do so. It is manifest, too,
          that God has the power to confer life upon it, inasmuch as He grants
          life to us who are in existence. And, therefore, since the Lord has
          power to infuse life into what He has fashioned, and since the flesh
          is capable of being quickened, what remains to prevent its
          participating in incorruption, which is a blissful and never-ending
          life granted by God?
