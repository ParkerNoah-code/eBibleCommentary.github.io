          4. Light ariseth in darkness to the righteous: he is gracious,
          merciful, and just.5. A good man showeth pity, and lendeth: he manages
          his affairs uprightly.6. Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the
          just shall be held in perpetual remembrance.7. He shall not be afraid
          when he hears evil tidings: his heart is fixed, because he confides in
          Jehovah.8. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he
          see his desire upon his enemies.

          4 Light ariseth The Hebrew verb zrch, zarach, may be taken
          intransitively, as I have inserted it in the text, or transitively, as
          in the marginal reading; in either way the signification is the same.
          Whichsoever of these translations you adopt, the words are susceptible
          of a twofold interpretation; either, that as the sun shines on one
          part of the earth, and all the other parts of it are enveloped in
          darkness, so God exempts the righteous from the common calamities of
          human life; or, as day succeeds night, so God, though he permit the
          hearts of his servants to be in heaviness for a season, will cause a
          time of calmness and clearness to return to them. If the latter
          exposition is adopted, then, by darkness, or by the cloudy, and rainy,
          or stormy season, the prophet means the afflictions to which God
          subjects his servants for the trial of their patience. The former
          interpretation appears to be more appropriate, That, when the whole
          world is overwhelmed with troubles, God's grace shines upon the
          faithful, who feel comfortable and happy, because he is propitious
          towards them. It is thus that their condition is properly
          distinguished from that which forms the common lot of other men. For
          the ungodly, however they may exult in prosperity, are, nevertheless,
          blind in the midst of light, because they are strangers to God's
          paternal kindness; and, in adversity, they are plunged into the
          darkness of death; and, consequently, they never enjoy a season of
          calm repose. On the contrary, the godly, upon whom the favor of God
          constantly shines, though liable to the ills incident to humanity, are
          never overwhelmed with darkness, and hence the propriety of what is
          here stated, light ariseth to them in darkness If we give to the
          Hebrew verb an active signification, then, in one respect, the
          construction of the words will be preferable. For I have no doubt that
          the prophet intends, as applicable to God, the epithets, gracious,
          merciful, and just Therefore, if we read it as a neuter verb, light
          ariseth, then the latter clause of the verse will be the reason for
          the statement made in the former clause. As to the exposition, that
          the righteous and humane do not diffuse darkness over the world, as
          the unrighteous and wicked do; that they do not extract smoke from
          light, but light from smoke; it must be viewed as nothing else than a
          perversion of the prophet's language.

          5 A good man This is the commonly received interpretation of the
          passage. I am disposed, however, to prefer another, That it shall be
          well with those who are gracious and communicative; because this is
          more in accordance with the purport of the prophet's language. It is
          his intention to show how greatly the ungodly are deceived, when they
          aspire after happiness by nefarious and unlawful practices; seeing
          that the favor of God is the source and cause of all good things.
          Hence it becomes necessary to supply the relative who. He proceeds,
          therefore, to put us on our guard as to the deception which those
          practice upon themselves, who hasten to enrich themselves by sordid
          parsimony and oppressive extortion; inasmuch as the faithful, by their
          clemency and kindness, open up a channel, through which the favor of
          God flows to them: for the term tvv, tob, though in the masculine
          gender, signifying good, is often taken as if it were neuter, to
          denote that which is good. He puts lending as if it were the fruit of
          mercy; for the usurer also lends, but it is that, under the false
          pretense of assisting the distressed, he may plunder them. It is,
          then, the truly liberal, who, from compassion, and not with the design
          of ensnaring the poor, grant relief to them, that God makes
          prosperous. The term dvym, debarim, in the end of the verse, signifies
          words; but, along with David Kimchi, the most correct expositor among
          the Rabbins, I take it to mean affairs. Words is a very tame
          translation, not to say, that, if this had been the prophet's
          intention, he would have expressed himself in more simple terms. The
          translation which I have given is the proper one, that the righteous
          will manage their affairs with prudence and discernment; so that, in
          their domestic affairs, they will neither be too lavish nor sordidly
          parsimonious; but, in every thing, they will study to combine
          frugality with economy, without giving way to luxury. And, in all
          their mercantile transactions; they will always be guided by the
          principles of equity and morality.

          6 Surely he shall not be moved. The Hebrew particle ky, ki, may here
          be taken in its natural or causal meaning, and thus be rendered for,
          especially if in the preceding verse we adopt the marginal reading, It
          shall be well with the man. For he refers in more explicit terms to
          that happiness of which he spake, that God sustains the compassionate
          and humane, so that amid all the vicissitudes of life they remain
          unmoved; that he makes their innocence appear, and protects them from
          unjust calumny. It is said they are never moved They are indeed liable
          to the incidents common to humanity, and even may often appear as if
          they were about to sink under the weight of their calamities; but
          their confidence remains unshaken, and by invincible patience they
          surmount all their adversities. With God as the defender of their
          righteousness, they yet do not escape from being assailed by the
          slanders of the ungodly, but it is enough for them that their name is
          blessed before God, the angels, and the whole assembly of the godly.

          7. He shall not be afraid when he hears evil tidings This may appear
          to be a confirmation of the statement contained in the preceding
          verse, being as much as to say, That the righteous are exempted from
          the infamous name which the reprobate secure to themselves by their
          vicious conduct. I rather take the meaning to be, that the righteous,
          unlike unbelievers, who tremble at every even the slightest rumor,
          calmly and peacefully confide in God's paternal care, amid all the
          evil tidings which may reach them. Whence is it that unbelievers are
          in constant agitation, but that they imagine they are the sport of
          fortune on the earth, while God remains at ease in heaven? No wonder,
          then, that the rustling of the falling leaf troubles and alarms them.
          From such uneasiness the faithful are freed, because they neither give
          heed to rumors, nor does the fear of them prevent them from constantly
          invoking God. The children of God may also manifest symptoms of fear
          at the prospect of impending danger; for were they altogether
          regardless of calamities, such indifference would be the result, not
          of confidence in God, but of insensibility. But should they not be
          able to lay aside all fear and anxiety, yet, acknowledging God as the
          guardian of their life, and pursuing the tenor of their way, they
          intrust themselves to his preserving care, and cheerfully resign
          themselves to his disposal. This is that magnanimity of the righteous,
          under the influence of which the prophet declares they can disregard
          those rumors of evil which strike others with alarm. Wisely, too, do
          they rely upon God for support; because, encompassed on all sides with
          deaths innumerable, we would sink into despair were we not borne up by
          the confidence that we are secure under God's protection. Genuine
          stability, then, is that which the prophet here describes, and which
          consists in reposing with unshaken confidence in God. On the other
          hand, that presumptuous confidence with which the ungodly are
          intoxicated exposes them the more, to the indignation of God, inasmuch
          as they overlook the frailty of human life, and in their pride of
          heart madly set themselves in opposition to him. Therefore, when |they
          shall say, Peace and safety, then shall sudden destruction come upon
          them,| (1 Thessalonians 5:3.) But a sense of calamities, while it
          alarms and disconcerts the faithful, does not make them faint-hearted,
          because it does not shake their faith, by which they are rendered bold
          and steadfast. In a word, they are not insensible to their trials, but
          the confidence which they place in God enables them to rise above all
          the cares of the present life. Thus they preserve calmness and
          composedness of mind, and wait patiently till the fit season arrives
          for taking vengeance upon the reprobate.<br />
