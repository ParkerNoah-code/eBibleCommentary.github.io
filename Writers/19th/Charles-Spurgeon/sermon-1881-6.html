        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1627)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, October 30th, 1881, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
          were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by
          baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by
          the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
          life.| -- Romans 6:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          I SHALL not enter into controversy over this text, although over it
          some have raised the question of infant baptism or believers' baptism,
          immersion or sprinkling. If any person can give a consistent and
          instructive interpretation of the text, otherwise than by assuming
          believers' immersion to be Christian baptism, I should like to see
          them do it. I myself am quite incapable of performing such a feat, or
          even of imagining how it can be done. I am content to take the view
          that baptism signifies the burial of believers in water in the name of
          the Lord, and I shall so interpret the text. If any think not so, it
          may at least interest them to know what we understand to be the
          meaning of the baptismal rite, and I trust that they may think none
          the less of the spiritual sense because they differ as to the external
          sign. After all, the visible emblem is not the most prominent matter
          in the text. May God the Holy Spirit help us to reach its inner
          teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not understand Paul to say that if improper persons, such as
          unbelievers, and hypocrites, and deceivers, are baptized they are
          baptized into our Lord's death. He says |so many of us,| putting
          himself with the rest of the children of God. He intends such as are
          entitled to baptism, and come to it with their hearts in a right
          state. Of them he says, |Know ye not, that so many of us as were
          baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?| He does not
          even intend to say that those who were rightly baptized have all of
          them entered into the fullness of its spiritual meaning; for if they
          had, there would have been no need of the question, |Know ye not?| It
          would seem that some had been baptized who did not clearly know the
          meaning of their own baptism. They had faith, and a glimmer of
          knowledge sufficient to make them right recipients of baptism, but
          they were not well instructed in the teaching of baptism; perhaps they
          saw in it only a washing, but had never discerned the burial. I will
          go further, and say that I question if any of us yet know the fullness
          of the meaning of either of the ordinances which Christ has
          instituted. As yet we are, with regard to spiritual things, like
          children playing on the beach while the ocean rolls before us. At best
          we wade up to our ankles like our little ones on the sea shore. A few
          among us are learning to swim; but then we only swim where the bottom
          is almost within reach. Who among us has yet come to lose sight of
          shore and to swim in the Atlantic of divine love, where fathomless
          truth rolls underneath, and the infinite is all around? Oh, may God
          daily teach us more and more of what we already know in part, and may
          the truth which we have as yet but dimly perceived come to us in a
          brighter and clearer manner, till we see all things in clear sunlight.
          This can only be as our own character becomes more clear and pure; for
          we see according to what we are; and as is the eye such is that which
          it sees. The pure in heart alone can see a pure and holy God. We shall
          be like Jesus when we shall see him as he is, and certainly we shall
          never see him as he is till we are like him. In heavenly things we see
          as much as we have within ourselves. He who has eaten Christ's flesh
          and blood spiritually is the man who can see this in the sacred
          Supper, and he who has been baptized into Christ sees Christ in
          baptism. To him that hath shall be given, and he shall have
          abundantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptism sets forth the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, and
          our participation therein. Its teaching is twofold. First, think of
          our representative union with Christ, so that when he died and was
          buried it was on our behalf, and we were thus buried with him. This
          will give you the teaching of baptism so far as it sets forth a creed.
          We declare in baptism that we believe in the death of Jesus, and
          desire to partake in all the merit of it. But there is a second
          equally important matter and that is our realized union with Christ
          which is set forth in baptism, not so much as a doctrine of our creed
          as a matter of our experience. There is a manner of dying, of being
          buried, of rising, and of living in Christ which must be displayed in
          each one of us if we are indeed members of the body of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, I want you to think of OUR REPRESENTATIVE UNION WITH
          CHRIST as it is set forth in baptism as a truth to be believed. Our
          Lord Jesus is the substitute for his people, and when he died it was
          on their behalf and in their stead. The great doctrine of our
          justification lies in this, that Christ took our sins, stood in our
          place, and as our surety suffered, and bled, and died, thus presenting
          on our behalf a sacrifice for sin. We are to regard him, not as a
          private person, but as our representative. We are buried with him in
          baptism unto death to show that we accept him as being for us dead and
          buried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptism as a burial with Christ signifies, first, acceptance of the
          death and burial of Christ as being for us. Let us do that at this
          very moment with all our hearts. What other hope have we? When our
          divine Lord came down from the heights of glory and took upon himself
          our manhood, he became one with you and with me; and being found in
          fashion as a man, it pleased the Father to lay sin upon him, even your
          sins and mine. Do you not accept that truth, and agree that the Lord
          Jesus should be the bearer of your guilt, and stand for you in the
          sight of God? |Amen! Amen!| say all of you. He went up to the tree
          loaded with all this guilt, and there he suffered in our room and
          stead as we ought to have suffered. It pleased the Father, instead of
          bruising us, to bruise him. He put him to grief, making his soul an
          offering for sin. Do we not gladly accept Jesus as our substitute? O
          beloved, whether you have been baptized in water or not, I put this
          question to you, |Do you accept the Lord Jesus as your surety and
          substitute?| For if you do not, you shall bear your own guilt and
          carry your own sorrow, and stand in your own place beneath the glance
          of the angry justice of God. Many of us at this moment are saying in
          our inmost hearts --
        </p>
        <p>|My soul looks back to see</p>
        <p>The burdens thou didst bear,</p>
        <p>When hanging on the cursed tree,</p>
        <p>And hopes her guilt was there.|</p>
        <p>
          Now, by being buried with Christ in baptism, we set our seal to the
          fact that the death of Christ was on our behalf, and that we were in
          him, and died in him, and, in token of our belief, we consent to the
          watery grave, and yield ourselves to be buried according to his
          command. This is a matter of fundamental faith -- Christ dead and
          buried for us; in other words, substitution, suretyship, vicarious
          sacrifice. His death is the hinge of our confidence: we are not
          baptized into his example, or his life, but into his death. We hereby
          confess that all our salvation lies in the death of Jesus, which death
          we accept as having been incurred on our account.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not all; because if I am to be buried, it should not be so
          much because I accept the substitutionary death of another for me as
          because I am dead myself. Baptism is an acknowledgment of our own
          death in Christ. Why should a living man be buried? Why should he even
          be buried because another died on his behalf? My burial with Christ
          means not only that he died for me, but that I died in him, so that my
          death with him needs a burial with him. Jesus died for us because he
          is one with us. The Lord Jesus Christ did not take his people's sins
          by an arbitrary choice of God; but it was most natural and fit and
          proper that he should take his people's sins, since they are his
          people, and he is their federal head. It behooved Christ to suffer for
          this reason -- that he was the covenant representative of his people.
          He is the Head of the body, the Church; and if the members sinned, it
          was meet that the Head, though the Head had not sinned, should bear
          the consequence of the acts of the body. As there is a natural
          relationship between Adam and those that are in Adam, so is there
          between the second Adam and those that are in him. I accept what the
          first Adam did as my sin. Some of you may quarrel with it, and with
          the whole covenant dispensation, if you please; but as God has pleased
          to set it up, and I feel the effect of it, I see no use in my
          controverting it. As I accept the sin of father Adam, and feel that I
          sinned in him, even so with intense delight I accept the death and
          atoning sacrifice of my second Adam , and rejoice that in him I have
          died and risen again. I lived, I died, I kept the law, I satisfied
          justice in my covenant Head. Let me be buried in baptism that I may
          show to all around that I believe I was one with my Lord in his death
          and burial for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at this, O child of God, and do not be afraid of it. These are
          Grand truths, but they are sure and comforting. You are getting among
          Atlantic billows now, but be not afraid. Realize the sanctifying
          effect of this truth. Suppose that a man had been condemned to die on
          account of a great crime; suppose, further, that he has actually died
          for that crime, and now, by some wonderful work of God, after having
          died he has been made to live again. He comes among men again as alive
          from the dead, and what ought to be the state of his mind with regard
          to his offence? Will he commit that crime again? A crime for which he
          has died? I say emphatically, God forbid. Rather should he say, |I
          have tasted the bitterness of this sin, and I am miraculously lifted
          up out of the death which it brought upon me, and made to live again:
          now will I hate the thing that slew me, and abhor it with all my
          soul.| He who has received the wages of sin should learn to avoid it
          for the future. But you reply, |We never did die so; we were never
          made to suffer the due reward of our sins.| Granted. But that which
          Christ did for you comes to the same thing, and the Lord looks upon it
          as the same thing. You are so one with Jesus, that you must regard his
          death as your death, his sufferings as the chastisement of your peace.
          You have died in the death of Jesus, and now by strange, mysterious
          grace you are brought up again from the pit of corruption unto newness
          of life. Can you, will you, go into sin again? You have seen what God
          thinks of sin: you perceive that he utterly loathes it; for when it
          was laid on his dear Son, he did not spare him, but put him to grief
          and smote him to death. Can you, after that, turn back to the accursed
          thing which God hates? Surely, the effect of the great grief of the
          Saviour upon your spirit must be sanctifying. How shall we who are
          dead to sin live any longer therein? How shall we that have passed
          under its curse, and endured its awful penalty, tolerate its power?
          Shall we go back to this murderous, villainous, virulent, abominable
          evil? It cannot be. Grace forbids.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine is not the conclusion of the whole matter. The text
          describes us as buried with a view to rising. |Therefore we are buried
          with him by baptism unto death,| -- for what object? -- |that like as
          Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
          we also should walk in newness of life.| Be buried in Christ! What
          for? That you may be dead for ever? No, but that now getting where
          Christ is, you may go where Christ goes. Behold him, then: he goes,
          first, into the sepulchre, but next out of the sepulchre; for when the
          third morning came he rose. If you are one with Christ at all, you
          must be one with him all through; you must be one with him in his
          death, and one with him in his burial, then you shall come to be one
          with him in his resurrection. Am I a dead man now? No, blessed be his
          name, it is written, |Because I live ye shall live also.| True, I am
          dead in one sense, |For ye are dead|; but yet not dead in another,
          |For your life is hid with Christ in God|; and how is he absolutely
          dead who has a hidden life? No; since I am one with Christ I am what
          Christ is: as he is a living Christ, I am a living spirit. What a
          glorious thing it is to have arisen from the dead, because Christ has
          given us life. Our old legal life has been taken from us by the
          sentence of the law, and the law views us as dead; but now we have
          received a new life, a life out of death, resurrection-life in Christ
          Jesus. The life of the Christian is the life of Christ. Ours is not
          the life of the first creation, but of the new creation from among the
          dead. Now we live in newness of life, quickened unto holiness, and
          righteousness, and joy by the Spirit of God. The life of the flesh is
          a hindrance to us; our energy is in his Spirit. In the highest and
          best sense our life is spiritual and heavenly. This also is doctrine
          which is to be held most firmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to see the force of this; for I am aiming at practical
          results this morning. If God has given to you and to me an entirely
          new life in Christ, how can that new life spend itself after the
          fashion of the old life? Shall the spiritual live as the carnal? How
          can you that were the servants of sin, but have been made free by
          precious blood, go back to your old slavery? When you were in the old
          Adam life, you lived in sin, and loved it; but now you have been dead
          and buried, and have come forth into newness of life: can it be that
          you can go back to the beggarly elements from which the Lord has
          brought you out? If you live in sin, you will be false to your
          profession, for you profess to be alive unto God? If you walk in lust,
          you will tread under foot the blessed doctrines of the Word of God,
          for these lead to holiness and purity. You would make Christianity to
          be a by-word and a proverb, if, after all, you who were quickened from
          your spiritual death should exhibit a conduct no better than the life
          of ordinary men, and little superior to what your former life used to
          be. As many of you as have been baptized have said to the world, -- We
          are dead to the world, and we have come forth into a new life. Our
          fleshly desires are henceforth to be viewed as dead, for now we live
          after a fresh order of things. The Holy Spirit has wrought in us a new
          nature, and though we are in the world, we are not of it, but are
          new-made men, |created anew in Christ Jesus.| This is the doctrine
          which we avow to all mankind, that Christ died and rose again, and
          that his people died and rose again in him. Out of the doctrine grows
          death unto sin and life unto God, and we wish by every action and
          every movement of our lives to teach it to all who see us.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far the doctrine: is it not a precious one indeed? Oh, if you be
          indeed one with Christ, shall the world find you polluting yourselves?
          Shall the members of a generous, gracious Head be covetous and
          grasping? Shall the members of a glorious, pure, and perfect Head be
          defiled with the lusts of the flesh and the follies of a vain life? If
          believers are indeed so identified with Christ that they are his
          fullness, should they not be holiness itself? If we live by virtue of
          our union with his body, how can we live as other Gentiles do? How is
          it that so many professors exhibit a mere worldly life, living for
          business and for pleasure, but not for God, in God, or with God? They
          sprinkle a little religion on a worldly life, and so hope to
          Christianize it. But it will not do. I am bound to live as Christ
          would have lived under my circumstances; in my private chamber or in
          my public pulpit, I am bound to be what Christ would have been in like
          case. I am bound to prove to men that union to Christ is no fiction,
          or fanatical sentiment: but that we are swayed by the same principles
          and actuated by the same motives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptism is thus an embodied creed, and you may read it in these words:
          |Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
          through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from
          the dead.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But , secondly, A REALIZED UNION WITH CHRIST is also set forth in
          baptism, and this is rather a matter of experience than of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, there is, as a matter of actual experience in the true
          believer, death. |Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into
          Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?| It must be contrary to all
          law to bury those who are yet alive. Until they are dead, men can have
          no right to be buried. Very well, then, the Christian is dead, --
          dead, first, to the dominion of sin. Whenever sin called him aforetime
          he answered, |Here am I, for thou didst call me.| Sin ruled his
          members, and if sin said, |Do this,| he did it, like the soldiers
          obedient to their centurion; for sin ruled over all the parts of his
          nature, and exercised over him a supreme tyranny. Grace has changed
          all this. When we are converted we become dead to the dominion of sin.
          If sin calls us now, we refuse to come, for we are dead. If sin
          commands us we will not obey, for we are dead to its authority. Sin
          comes to us now -- oh, that it did not, -- and it finds in us the old
          corruption which is crucified, but not yet dead; but it has no
          dominion over our true life. Blessed be God, sin cannot reign over us,
          though it may assail us and work us harm. |Sin shall not have dominion
          over you; for ye are not under law, but under grace.| We sin, but not
          with allowance. With what grief we look back upon our transgressions!
          How earnestly do we endeavour to avoid them! Sin tries to maintain its
          usurped power over us; but we do not acknowledge it as our sovereign.
          Evil enters us now as an interloper and a stranger, and works sad
          havoc, but it does not abide in us upon the throne; it is an alien,
          and despised, and no more honoured and delighted in. We are dead to
          the reigning power of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The believer, if spiritually buried with Christ, is dead to the desire
          of any such power. |What!| say you, |do not godly men have sinful
          desires?| Alas, they do. The old nature that is in them lusteth
          towards sin; but the true man, the real ego, desires to be purged of
          every speck or trace of evil. The law in the members would fain urge
          to sin, but the life in the heart constrains to holiness. I can
          honestly say, for my own self, that the deepest desire of my soul is
          to live a perfect life. If I could have my own best desire, I would
          never sin again; and though, alas, I do consent to sin so that I
          become responsible when I transgress, yet my innermost self loathes
          iniquity. Sin is my bondage, not my pleasure; my misery, not my
          delight; at the thought of it I cry out, |O wretched man that I am!
          who shall deliver me?| In our heart of hearts our spirit cleaves
          steadfastly to that which is good, and true, and heavenly, so that the
          real man delights in the law of God, and follows hard after goodness.
          The main current and true bent of our soul's wish and will is not
          towards sin, and the apostle taught us no mere fancy when he said,
          |For he that is dead is freed from sin.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, in the next place we are dead as to the pursuits and aims of
          the sinning and ungodly life. Brethren, are any of you that profess to
          be God's servants living for yourselves? Then you are not God's
          servants; for he that is really born again lives unto God: the object
          of his life is the glory of God and the good of his fellow-men. This
          is the prize that is set before the quickened man, and towards this he
          runs. |I do not run that way,| says one. Very well, then you will not
          come to the desired end. If you are running after the pleasures of the
          world or the riches of it, you may win the prize you run for, but you
          cannot win |the prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus.| I hope
          that many of us can honestly say that we are now dead to every object
          in life, except the glory of God in Christ Jesus. We are in the world,
          and have to live as other men do, carrying on our ordinary business;
          but all this is subordinate, and held in as with bit and bridle; our
          aims are above yon changeful moon. The flight of our soul, like that
          of an eagle, is above these clouds: though that bird of the sun
          alights upon the rock, or even descends to the plain, yet its joy is
          to dwell above, out soaring the lightning, rising over the black head
          of the tempest, and looking down upon all earthly things. Henceforth
          our grace-given life speeds onward and upward; we are not of the
          world, and the world's engagements are not those upon which we spend
          our noblest powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we are dead in this sense, that we are dead to the guidance of
          sin. The lust of the flesh drives a man this way and that way. He
          steers his course by the question, |What is most pleasant? What will
          give me most present gratification?| The way of the ungodly is mapped
          out by the hand of selfish desire: but you that are true Christians
          have another guide, you are led by the Spirit in a right way. You ask,
          |What is good and what is acceptable in the sight of the Most High?|
          Your daily prayer is, |Lord, show me what thou wouldest have me to
          do?| You are alive to the teachings of the Spirit, who will lead you
          into all truth; but you are deaf, yea, dead to the dogmas of carnal
          wisdom, the oppositions of philosophy, the errors of proud human
          wisdom. Blind guides who fall with their victims into the ditch are
          shunned by you, for you have chosen the way of the Lord. What a
          blessed state of heart this is! I trust, my brethren, that we have
          fully realized it! We know the Shepherd's voice, and a stranger we
          will not follow. One is our teacher, and we submit our understandings
          to his infallible instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text must have had a very forcible meaning among the Romans in
          Paul's time, for they were sunk in all manner of odious vices. Take an
          average Roman of that period, and you would have found in him a man
          accustomed to spend a large part of his time in the amphitheater,
          hardened by the brutal sight of bloody shows, in which gladiators slew
          each other to amuse a holiday crowd. Taught in such a school, the
          Roman was cruel to the last degree, and withal ferocious in the
          indulgence of his passions. A depraved man was not regarded as being
          at all degraded; not only nobles and emperors were monsters of vice,
          but the public teachers were impure. When those who were regarded as
          moral were corrupt, you may imagine what the immoral were. |Enjoy
          yourself; follow after the pleasures of the flesh,| was the rule of
          the age. Christianity was the introduction of a new element. See here
          a Roman converted by the grace of God! What a change is in him! His
          neighbours say, |You were not at the amphitheater this morning. How
          could you miss the sight of the hundred Germans who tore out each
          other's bowels?| |No,| he says, |I was not there; I could not bear to
          be there. I am totally dead to it. If you were to force me to be
          there, I must shut my eyes, for I could not look on murder committed
          in sport!| The Christian did not resort to places of licentiousness;
          he was as good as dead to such filthiness. The fashions and customs of
          the age were such that Christians could not consent to them, and so
          they became dead to society. It was not merely that Christians did not
          go into open sin, but they spoke of it with horror, and their lives
          rebuked it. Things which the multitude counted a joy, and talked of
          exultingly, gave no comfort to the follower of Jesus, for he was dead
          to such evils. This is our solemn avowal when we come forward to be
          baptized. We say by acts which are louder than words that we are dead
          to those things in which sinners take delight, and we wish to be so
          accounted.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The next thought in baptism is burial. Death comes first, and
          burial follows. Now, what is burial, brethren? Burial is, first of
          all, the seal of death; it is the certificate of decease. |Is such a
          man dead?| say you. Another answers, |Why, dear sir, he was buried a
          year ago.| There have been instances of persons being buried alive,
          and I am afraid that the thing happens with sad frequency in baptism,
          but it is unnatural, and by no means the rule. I fear that many have
          been buried alive in baptism, and have therefore risen and walked out
          of the grave just as they were. But if burial is true, it is a
          certificate of death. If I am able to say in very truth, |I was buried
          with Christ thirty years ago,| I must surely be dead. Certainly the
          world thought so, for not long after my burial with Jesus I began to
          preach his name, and by that time the world thought me very far gone,
          and said, |He stinketh.| They began to say all manner of evil against
          the preacher; but the more I stank in their nostrils the better I
          liked it, for the surer I was that I was really dead to the world. It
          is good for a Christian to be offensive to wicked men. See how our
          Master stank in the esteem of the godless when they cried, |Away with
          him, away with him!| Though no corruption could come near his blessed
          body, yet his perfect character was not savoured by that perverse
          generation. There must, then, be in us death to the world, and some of
          the effects of death, or our baptism is void. As burial is the
          certificate of death, so is burial with Christ the seal of our
          mortification to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But burial is, next, the displaying of death. While the man is indoors
          the passers-by do not know that he is dead; but when the funeral takes
          place, and he is carried through the streets, everybody knows that he
          is dead. This is what baptism ought to be. The believer's death to sin
          is at first a secret, but by an open confession he bids all men know
          that he is dead with Christ. Baptism is the funeral rite by which
          death to sin is openly set forth before all men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, burial is the separateness of death. The dead man no longer
          remains in the house, but is placed apart as one who ceases to be
          numbered with the living. A corpse is not welcome company. Even the
          most beloved object after a while cannot be tolerated when death has
          done his work upon it. Even Abraham, who had been so long united with
          his beloved Sarah, is heard to say, |Bury my dead out of my sight.|
          Such is the believer when his death to the world is fully known: he is
          poor company for worldlings, and they shun him as a damper upon their
          revelry. The true saint is put into the separated class with Christ,
          according to his word, |If they have persecuted me, they will also
          persecute you.| The saint is put away in the same grave as his Lord;
          for as he was, so are we also in this world. He is shut up by the
          world in the one cemetery of the faithful, if I may so call it, where
          all that are in Christ are dead to the world together, with this
          epitaph for them all, |And ye are dead, and your life is hid with
          Christ in God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And the grave is the place -- I do not know where to get a word -- of
          the settledness of death; for when a man is dead and buried you never
          expect to see him come home again: so far as this world is concerned,
          death and burial are irrevocable. They tell me that spirits walk the
          earth, and we have all read in the newspaper |The Truth about Ghosts,|
          but I have my doubts on the subject. In spiritual things, however, I
          am afraid that some are not so buried with Christ but what they walk a
          great deal among the tombs. I am grieved at heart that it should be
          so. The man in Christ cannot walk as a ghost, because he is alive
          somewhere else; he has received a new being, and therefore he cannot
          mutter and peep among the dead hypocrites around him. See what our
          chapter saith about our Lord: |Christ being raised from the dead dieth
          no more: death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he
          died unto sin once: but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God.| If we
          have been once raised from dead works we shall never go back to them
          again. I may sin, but sin can never have dominion over me; I may be a
          transgressor and wander much from my God, but never can I go back to
          the old death again. When my Lord's grace got hold of me, and buried
          me, he wrought in my soul the conviction that henceforth and for ever
          I was to the world a dead man. I am right glad that I made no
          compromise, but came right out. I have drawn the sword, and thrown
          away the scabbard. Tell the world they need not try to fetch us back,
          for we are spoiled for them as much as if we were dead. All they could
          have would be our carcasses. Tell the world not to tempt us any
          longer, for our hearts are changed. Sin may charm the old man who
          hangs there upon the cross, and he may turn his leering eye that way,
          but he cannot follow up his glance, for he cannot get down from the
          cross: the Lord has taken care to use the mallet well, and he has
          fastened his hands and feet right firmly, so that the crucified flesh
          must still remain in the place of doom and death. Yet the true, the
          genuine life within us cannot die, for it is born of God; neither can
          it abide in the tombs, for its call is to purity and joy and liberty;
          and to that call it yields itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We have come as far as death and burial; but baptism, according to
          the text, represents also resurrection: |That like as Christ was
          raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
          should walk in newness of life.| Now, notice that the man who is dead
          in Christ, and buried in Christ, is also raised in Christ, and this is
          a special work upon him. All the dead are not raised, but our Lord
          himself is |the firstfruits of them that slept.| He is the
          first-begotten from among the dead. Resurrection was a special work
          upon the body of Christ by which he was raised up, and that work,
          begun upon the Head, will continue till all the members partake of it,
          for --
        </p>
        <p>|Though our inbred sins require</p>
        <p>Our flesh to see the dust;</p>
        <p>Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose,</p>
        <p>So all his followers must.|</p>
        <p>
          As to our soul and spirit, the resurrection has begun upon us. It has
          not come to our bodies yet, but it will be given to them at the
          appointed day. For the present a special work has been wrought upon us
          by which we have been raised up from among the dead. Brethren, if you
          had been dead and buried, and had been lying one night, say, in Woking
          Cemetery, and if a divine voice had called you right up from the grave
          when the silent stars were shining on the open heath -- if, I say, you
          had risen right out from the green mound of turf, what a lonely being
          you would have been in the vast cemetery amid the stilly night! How
          you would sit down on the grave and wait for morning! That is very
          much your condition with regard to the present evil world. You were
          once like the rest of the sinners around you, dead in sin, and
          sleeping in the grave of evil custom. The Lord by his power has called
          you out of your grave, and now you are alive in the midst of death.
          There can be no fellowship here for you; for what communion have the
          living with the dead? The man out there in the cemetery just quickened
          would find none among all the dead around him with whom he could
          converse, and you can find no companions in this world. There lies a
          skull, but it sees not from the eyeholes; neither is there speech in
          its grim mouth. I see a mass of bones lying in yon corner: the living
          one looks at them, but they cannot hear or speak. Imagine yourself
          there. All that you would say to the bones would be to ask, |Can these
          dry bones live?| You would be a foreigner in that home of corruption,
          and you would haste to get away. That is your condition in the world:
          God has raised you up from among the dead, from out of the company
          among whom you had your former conversation. Now, I pray you, do not
          go and scratch into the earth, to tear up the graves to find a friend
          there. Who would rend open a coffin and cry, |Come, you must drink
          with me! You must go to the theatre with me|? No, we dread the idea of
          association with the dead, and I tremble when I see a professor trying
          to have communion with worldly men. |Come ye out from among them; be
          ye separate; touch not the unclean thing.| You know what would happen
          to you if you were thus raised, and were forced to sit close to a dead
          body newly taken from the grave. You would cry, |I cannot bear it; I
          cannot endure it|; you would get to the wind side of the horrid
          corpse. So with a man that is really alive unto God: deeds of
          injustice, oppression, or unchastity he cannot endure; for life loaths
          corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that, as we are raised up by a special work from among the
          dead, that rising is by divine power. Christ is brought again |from
          the dead by the glory of the Father.| What means that? Why did it not
          say, |by the power of the Father|? Ah, beloved, glory is a grander
          word; for all the attributes of God are displayed in all their solemn
          pomp in the raising of Christ from the dead. There was the Lord's
          faithfulness; for had he not declared that his soul should not rest in
          hell, neither should His Holy One see corruption? Was not the love of
          the Father seen there? I am sure it was a delight to the heart of God
          to bring back life to the body of his dear Son. And so, when you and I
          are raised out of our death in sin, it is not merely God's power, it
          is not merely God's wisdom that is seen, it is |the glory of the
          Father.| Oh, to think that every child of God that has been quickened
          has been quickened by |the glory of the Father. | It has taken not
          alone the Holy Spirit, and the work of Jesus, and the work of the
          Father, but the very |glory of the Father.| If the tiniest spark of
          spiritual life has to be created by |the glory of the Father,| what
          will be the glory of that life when it comes into its full perfection,
          and we shall be like Christ, and see him as he is! O beloved, value
          highly the new life which God has given you. Think of it as making you
          richer than if you had a sea of pearls, greater than if you were
          descended from the loftiest of princes. There is in you that which it
          required all the attributes of God to create. He could make a world by
          power alone, but you must be raised from the dead by |the glory of the
          Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice next, that this life is entirely new. We are to |walk in
          newness of life.| The life of a Christian is an entirely different
          thing from the life of other men, entirely different from his own life
          before his conversion, and when people try to counterfeit it, they
          cannot accomplish the task. A person writes you a letter and wants to
          make you think he is a believer, but within about half-a-dozen
          sentences there occurs a line which betrays the imposter. The
          hypocrite has very neatly copied our expressions, but not quite. There
          is a freemasonry among us, and the outside world watch us a bit, and
          by-and-by they pick up certain of our signs; but there is a private
          sign which they can never imitate, and therefore at a certain point
          they break down. A godless man may pray as much as a Christian, read
          as much of the Bible as a Christian, and even go beyond us in
          externals; but there is a secret which he knows not and cannot
          counterfeit. The life divine is so totally new that the unconverted
          have no copy to work by. In every Christian it is as new as if he were
          the very first Christian. Even though in every one it is the image and
          superscription of Christ, yet there is a milled edge or a something
          about the real silver that these counterfeits cannot get a hold of. It
          is a new, a novel, a fresh, a divine thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, this life is an active thing. I have often wished that
          Paul had not been so fast when I have been reading him. His style
          travels in seven-leagued boots. He does not write like an ordinary
          man. I beg to tell him that if he had written this text according to
          proper order, it should run, |Like as Christ was raised up from the
          dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should be raised from
          the dead.| But see; Paul has got over ever so much ground while we are
          talking: he has reached to |walking.| The walking includes the living,
          of which it is the sign, and Paul thinks so fast when the Spirit of
          God is upon him that he has passed beyond the cause to the effect. No
          sooner do we get the new life than we become active: we do not sit
          down and say, |I have received a new life: how grateful I ought to be.
          I will quietly enjoy myself.| Oh dear, no. We have something to do
          directly we are alive, and we begin walking, and so the Lord keeps us
          all our lives in his work; he does not allow us to sit down contented
          with the mere fact that we live, nor does he allow us to spend all our
          time in examining whether we are alive or no; but he gives us one
          battle to fight, and then another; he gives us his house to build, his
          farm to till, his children to nurse, and his sheep to feed. At times
          we have fierce struggles with our own spirit, and fears lest sin and
          Satan should prevail, till our life is scarce discerned by itself, but
          it is always discerned by its acts. The life that is given to those
          who were dead with Christ is an energetic, forceful life, that is
          evermore busy for Christ, and would, if it could, move heaven and
          earth and subdue all things unto him who is its Head.
        </p>
        <p>
          This life Paul tells us is an unending one. Once get it, and it will
          never go from you. |Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it is a life which is not under the law or under sin. Christ
          came under the law when he was here, and he had our sin laid on him,
          and therefore died; but after he rose again there was no sin laid on
          him. In his resurrection both the sinner and the Surety are free. What
          had Christ to do after his rising? To bear any more sin? No, but just
          to live unto God. That is where you and I are. We have no sin to carry
          now; it was all laid on Christ. What have we to do? Every time we have
          the headache, or feel ill, are we to cry out, |This is a punishment
          for my sin|? Nothing of the kind. Our punishment is all done with, for
          we have borne the capital sentence, and are dead: our new life must be
          unto God.

        <p>|All that remains for me</p>
        <p>Is but to love and sing,</p>
        <p>And wait until the angels come</p>
        <p>To bear me to the King.|</p>
        <p>
          I have now to serve him and delight myself in him, and use the power
          which he gives me of calling others from the dead, saying, |Awake,
          thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
          thee light.| I am not going back to the grave of spiritual death nor
          to my grave-clothes of sin; but by divine grace I will still believe
          in Jesus, and go from strength to strength, not under law, not fearing
          hell, nor hoping to merit heaven, but as a new creature, loving
          because loved, living for Christ because Christ lives in me, rejoicing
          in glorious hope of that which is yet to be revealed by virtue of my
          oneness in Christ.

          Poor sinner, you do not know anything about this death and burial, and
          you never will till you have power to become sons of God, and that he
          gives to as many as believe on his name. Believe on his name, and it
          is all yours. Amen and Amen.
