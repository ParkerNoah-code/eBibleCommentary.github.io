          |The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back
          in the day of battle.| -- Psalm 78:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          I DO NOT THINK that it has ever been clearly ascertained to what
          particular historical event Asaph here refers, but I do not find that
          any of the commentators mention a very obscure passage in the First
          Book of Chronicles, which I venture to suggest may give us the
          explanation. In the first Book of Chronicles, the seventh chapter and
          the twentieth verse, you read: -- |And the sons of Ephraim, Shuthelah,
          and Bered his son, and Tabath his son, and Eladah, and Tabath his son,
          and Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom
          the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came
          down to take away their cattle. And Ephraim their father mourned many
          days, and his brethren came to comfort him.| This event appears to
          have occurred while the children of Israel were still in Egypt. It has
          been supposed by some that these sons of Ephraim made a raid upon the
          promised land, and attacked the men of Gath. Believing the land to be
          theirs by promise they went to take it before they had divine
          authority so to do. They made God's decrees the rule of their life
          instead of God's revealed will, and so they soon fell into trouble, --
          as those people always do who make that mistake, -- and their father
          Ephraim mourned over them many days. But it appears to have been
          rather an attack made upon them by some men of Gath. The people seem
          some of them to have been of Egyptian origin, and they probably made
          an attack upon the cattle of the men of Ephraim. These young men
          defended their cattle for a time, but at last -- if this be the event,
          which this Psalm refers to -- it would appear they turned their backs
          and so fell slain. That may or may not be. Still there are other
          passages in history, which might serve to illustrate the text. You are
          aware that Joshua was of the tribe of Ephraim, and probably on account
          of this, the ark of God was first placed at Shiloh. On the occasion
          when Hophni and Phineas were slain, the children of Israel, we are
          told, fled. It appears to have been the peculiar duty of the men of
          Ephraim, in whose tribe Shiloh was, to guard the ark. It may be
          possible that they were set around the ark as a body-guard to it, but
          fled at the approach of the Philistines, or fell slain together with
          Hophni and Phineas on that terrible and disastrous day. If this is the
          event alluded to you will find the history of it in the fourth chapter
          of the First Book of Samuel. Perhaps, however, reference is made to
          the whole history of the tribe of Ephraim, that though they were well
          armed and were dexterous men in the use of the bow, yet on many
          occasions they turned their backs in the day of battle. Whether any of
          these explanations interpret the historical reference or not, the
          subject in itself will furnish us with a theme for meditation.
        </p>
        <p>I. We will first consider for a little while WHAT THESE MEN DID.</p>
        <p>
          They turned their backs. When the time for fighting came they ought to
          have shown their fronts. Like bold men they should have kept their
          face to the foe and their breast against the adversary, but they
          dishonorably turned their backs and fled. This, I am sorry to say, is
          not an unusual thing amongst professing Christians. They turn back;
          they turn back in the day of battle. Some do this at the first
          appearance of difficulty. |There is a lion in the way,| saith the
          slothful man, |I shall be slain in the streets.| They hear that there
          is some trouble involved in Christian service, or that some
          persecution may be met with in the pursuit of truth, and straightway
          they look before they leap, as the world hath it, and turn back from
          the way which they supposed to be that of safety. Timorous and
          Mistrust come running down the hill crying, |The lions! the lions!|
          and thus may a pilgrim turn back towards the City of Destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others are somewhat braver. They bear the first brunt. When the
          skirmishers begin these are as bold as any; they can return blow for
          blow, and you bear them boast, as they buckle on their armor, at such
          a rate, that you would suppose, if you did not know that boasters are
          seldom good at fighting, that they must certainly be victorious.
          During the first thrust they stand like martyrs and behave like
          heroes, but very soon, when the armor gets a little battered, and the
          fine plume on their helmet a little stained, they turn back in the day
          of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some professors bear the fight a little longer. They are not to be
          laughed out of their religion; they can stand the jeers and jests of
          their old companions. When they find that they have got the cut direct
          in the society which once loved them so much they can put up with
          that, and they are very much complimented by themselves on having done
          it. |Cowards,| say they, |are those who flee; but we shall never do
          this.| But by and by the skirmishers have done their work, and it
          comes to a hand-to-hand fight; the struggle begins to be somewhat more
          arduous, and now shall we see what metal they are made of. The enemy
          gets hold of them, and
        </p>
        <p>|That desperate tug their soul might feel</p>
        <p>Through bars of brass and triple steel.|</p>
        <p>
          Then they find that they are being hugged in the wrong place; they are
          touched in a tender part, and so they also turn back in the day of
          battle!
        </p>
        <p>
          And, alas! sad as it is to say it -- firmly as we believe that every
          child of God is safe, yet is it true that many who profess to be so,
          after having fought so long that you would suppose the next thing
          would be for them to rest upon their laurels and receive their crown,
          just at the very last they fall and turn hack! We have seen
          grey-headed apostates as well as juvenile ones. There have been those
          who seemed to wear well for a time, but at last one crushing blow came
          which they could not bear, and they gave way before it! Oh, brethren,
          it is only those who persevere to the end that will be saved, and only
          those who have a true faith in Jesus Christ have a sure evidence of
          their election of God; these be they who shall be clothed with white
          raiment, and shall sit down upon his throne for ever. But, how many
          who bade fair to do this, after all turn back!
        </p>
        <p>
          I may be describing -- I hope I am not -- some actual case here. Some
          of you may say as you turn the thought over in your minds, --
        </p>
        <p>|My feet had almost gone;</p>
        <p>My steps had well nigh slipped.|</p>
        <p>
          That young man over yonder was so much jeered at the other day by
          those with whom he works, that he felt it was very unkind, and he did
          think something about renouncing his religion altogether. And my other
          brother yonder, who has had so many losses, has lately had such a time
          as he never had before, and he thinks nobody else ever had; and he
          cries, |God has forsaken me.| He cannot just now say, |Though he slay
          me yet will I trust in him;| but he thinks, |Surely I had better turn
          to the world; I had better leave my religion and give it up, for I am
          encompassed about with such a terrible conflict that I shall never win
          the victory!| Ah! brethren, these are often the trials that God sends,
          and it is by these that he separates the chaff from the wheat, and
          lets us see who are true soldiers, and who are only the lacqueys who
          wear regimentals, but have not the soldier's heart pulsing beneath the
          scarlet. God grant us grace to be found at last men that turned not
          back in the day of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I take the history of the children of Ephraim, I should say that
          they turned their backs and failed to defend the ark. There are some
          who, when they are defending the truth, shun controversy. They are of
          such a timid disposition -- a loving disposition they call it -- that
          as soon as ever the war-trumpet sounds they find it to be their duty
          to attend to the baggage in the rear. They are very brave men indeed
          in that particular quarter of the conflict where it does not happen to
          rage; but there in the van, where the corpses are piled on heaps, and
          where the battle-axes drip with gore, they never will be found,
          because they have not the courage to fight and to conquer for Jesus.
          As far as they are concerned the ark of God may be taken by the
          Philistines, because they turn their backs.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Ephraimites ought, too, as Joshua had set them the example, to
          have conquered Canaan, and to have driven out the Canaanites still
          left. Ah! my brethren, there are some of you whose sins still live,
          because you have turned your backs upon them, but not in the right
          sense, for you have turned your backs against contending with sin.
          There is that bad temper of yours -- you have given up trying to curb
          it now. You say, |Well, you know many of God's children have bad
          tempers,| whereas you know that this is very wicked talking. You ought
          to slay that Agag. You have no business to tolerate a bad temper. You
          must never have any peace with that spiteful temper, or that hasty
          temper of yours; you must down with it, or else it will down with you,
          and if you do not overcome it, it will overcome you. Rest assured that
          you are guilty, and that you turn your back if you do not fight with
          it. So too with that worldliness of yours and that want of a prayerful
          spirit. If you say, |Well, I will be content to be as I am; I will not
          try after a high state of piety,| you turn your backs, my brethren.
          You ought to slay all these Canaanites, and you must in Christ's name
          do it, and not spare so much as one of them, but say, |they compass me
          about, like bees, yea, they compass me about, but in the name of the
          Lord will I destroy them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, when these people turned their backs, Canaan was not won. So
          it is with you. The Lord's kingdom is not yet fully extended, and just
          when you ought to be pushing far and wide the conquests of the cross,
          and be letting this great city of ours know that the King reigneth
          mighty to save, you turn back in the day of battle. There are some
          Christians here who are doing nothing. I should not say this, perhaps,
          if I were preaching on Sunday, for I thank God that I could not in my
          own heart say it of my own members; the most of them are doing, I
          believe, as much as lieth in them, or if not, I hope they very soon
          will be. But I am persuaded that there are many other Christians who
          are not doing what they should do, but are shrinking from practical
          service. They come in here, perhaps, on a Thursday night, and get a
          little bit, and they go elsewhere on other evenings of the week and
          pick up sweet morsels and crumbs. They like feeding very well, but
          they do not like work so much. There is a certain little company that
          come here on week-day evenings, into whose ears I should like to
          whisper, and ask them what they are doing for Christ. They are
          spiritual vagrants who go from one place to another, but have no
          settled home where they work for the Master, and they are of very
          little credit to anybody. We must all of us have a sphere of labor,
          and though I am glad to see all of you, as many as like to come, yet I
          pray you do have your own place for your own work, and do not be like
          the children of Ephraim who |turned back in the day of battle.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus observed what these men of Ephraim did, we come to
          look at the inopportune time WHEN THEY DID IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          They turned back, and their doing so would not have mattered much had
          they done it in a day of feasting. They could always be spared then,
          but that was not when they did it. They always had their faces to the
          front when there was any feasting to be done. They turned back; when?
          On holidays, when the banners waved high and the silver trumpets
          sounded? No; they were in the front then! Exeter Hall! May meetings!
          How many people are in the front there and then? When there is
          something sweet to feed upon they do not think of turning back. But
          these people turned back on rather a different occasion; they turned
          back in the day of battle. They turned back, it seems then, just when
          they were to be tried. Ah! how much there is we do that will not stand
          trial! How much there is of godliness which is useful for anything
          excepting that which it is meant for! It is all in vain for me to say,
          if I have bought a water-proof coat, that it is good for everything
          except keeping the water out. Why, then it is good for nothing, and so
          there are some Christians who have got a religion that is good for
          every day except the day when it has to be tested, and then it is good
          for nothing. An anchor may be very pretty on shore, and it may be very
          showy as an ornament when it lies on the ship's deck or hangs from the
          side, but what is the good of it if it will not hold when the wind
          blows and the vessel needs to be held fast? So, alas! there is much of
          religion and of godliness, so called, that is no good when it comes to
          the day of trial. The soldier is truly proved to be a soldier when the
          war-trumpet sounds and the regiment must go up to the cannon's mouth.
          Then shall you know, when the bayonets begin to cross, who has the
          true soldier's blood in him; but ah! how many turn back when it really
          comes to the conflict, for then the day of trial is too much for them!
        </p>
        <p>
          They turned back at the only time when they were of any sort of use. A
          man who has to fight is not of any particular use to his country, that
          I know of, except when there is fighting to be done. Like a man in any
          other trade, there is a season when he is wanted. Now, if the
          Christian soldier never fights, of what good is he at all? That is a
          very remarkable passage in one of the prophets, where the Lord
          compares his people to a vine, and then he says of them, in words of
          which I will give the sense, |If the vine bears fruit it is very
          valuable, but, if it bears no fruit, then it is good for nothing at
          all.| An oak without fruit is valuable for its timber, and even thorns
          are useful, for you may make a hedge of them. Smaller plants may be
          used for some medicinal purposes, but the vine, if it bear no fruit,
          is absolutely good for nothing. |Will a man even make a peg of it,
          whereon to hang a vessel?| saith the prophet. No, it is of no service
          whatever. So is it with the Christian. If he be not thorough and true
          he is no good at all; you can make nothing of him whatever; he is, to
          use Christ's expressive words, |Neither fit for the land nor even for
          the dunghill, and men cast him out.| Who would enlist a soldier that
          knew he would turn back? and who amongst us would like to be in his
          regiment? Take off his colors, play |The Rogue's March,| and turn him
          out of the barracks! And this is what will come to some professors who
          turn back in the day of battle! Their regimentals will be torn off,
          and they will be excluded from the church of God because they turned
          back in the day of trial and at the time when they were needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They turned their backs, too, like fools, in the day when victory was
          to be won. The soldier wants to distinguish himself; he wants to rise
          out of the ranks; he wants to be promoted. He hardly expects an
          opportunity of doing this in time of peace; but the officer rises when
          in time of war he leads a successful charge. And so it is with the
          Christian soldier. I make no advance while I am not fighting. I cannot
          win if I am not warring. My only opportunity for conquering is when I
          am fighting. If I run away when there is a chance of winning the
          crown, then I am like the ship that does not come out of harbour when
          there is a fair wind, or like the man who does not avail himself of
          the high tide to get his vessel over the bar at the harbour's mouth. I
          cannot win without fighting, and therefore I thank God when the trial
          comes, and count it a joy when I fall into manifold temptations,
          because now I may add to my faith one virtue after another, till my
          Christian character is all complete. To throw away the time of
          conflict is to throw away the crown. Oh simple heart! Oh silly heart!
          to be afraid of suffering for Jesus! You are, in fact, afraid of
          reigning with him, for you must do the one if you would do the other.
          You, young woman, who are so alarmed at a little laughing, recollect
          you cannot go to heaven without being laughed at sometimes in the
          circle in which you move, or the family in which you live. He that
          will live a godly life in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution. Since,
          then, this is the way to heaven, why do you turn from it? Be not like
          these children of Ephraim who turned back when there was a crown to be
          won.
        </p>
        <p>
          They turned back, once more, when turning back involved the most
          disastrous defeat. The ark of God was taken. |Ichabod,| the enemy
          cried, for the glory was departed from Israel, because the children of
          Ephraim turned back in the day of battle. And so, dear friends, unless
          God gives you preserving grace to stand fast to the end, do you not
          see that you are turning back to -- what? To perdition. You do not
          turn back merely to the world. That is what it looks like, perhaps, to
          you, but you really turn back to hell. If, after having once put your
          hand to the plough, you look back, you are unworthy of the kingdom;
          but what are you worthy of? Why, those |reserved seats| in hell! Did
          you ever think of that? There are such, and let me quote a passage,
          which proves it. We are told in one place of darkness |reserved| for
          some who were |wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of
          darkness for ever!| When you turn back you turn back to those reserved
          places where the darkness is more black and the pain more terrible.
          Oh! may God save you from ever turning back in the day of battle!
          This, then, is when they did it -- they turned back in the day of
          battle.
        </p>
        <p>III. But now let us notice, WHO THEY WERE THAT TURNED BACK.</p>
        <p>
          They were |children of Ephraim,| and they are described as |being
          armed and carrying bows,| or bows throwing forth sharp arrows. They
          were men of a noble parentage. They were the children of Ephraim.
          Joshua was of that line, and he was the greatest of conquerors, who
          led the people into the promised laud. And you professors, you profess
          to be descended from our Joshua, -- Jesus the Conqueror, and will you
          turn back? Are you followers of the Savior who gave his back to the
          smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and are you
          afraid or ashamed of anything? He gave his face to be spat upon, and
          will you hide your faces at the mention of his name, because fools
          choose to laugh at you? Followers of Joshua, and vet afraid? Followers
          of Jesus, and yet blush? God grant that we may never blush, except
          when we think that we ever blushed at the thought of his Son! Oh! thou
          dear, despised, and persecuted One, I see thee on thy way amidst the
          scoffers. One plucks thy beard; another pulls thy hair; a third casts
          his accursed spittle into thy face; another beats thee; another cries,
          |Let him be crucified.| They mock thee with all forms of mockery.
          Taunt and jeer they heap upon thee. They fill thy mouth with vinegar,
          and give thee gall to drink. They pierce thy hands and thy feet, and
          yet thou goest on along thy way of kindness and of mercy! And I --
          what have I ever suffered compared with thee? And these thy people --
          what have any of these endured, or what can they endure, compared with
          all thy griefs? Thy martyrs follow thee. Up from their fiery stakes
          they mount to their thrones. Confessors follow thee; from dungeons and
          from racks their testimony sounds. And, shall we, upon whom the ends
          of the earth are come, in these softer and gentler times, shall we
          turn back, and say we know not the Man? O God, forbid! but do thou
          keep us faithful unto thee, that we, the sons of Ephraim, may not turn
          back in the day of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, they were armed, and had proper weapons, weapons which
          they knew how to use, and good weapons for that period of warfare. And
          as Christians, what weapons have we? Here is this |Sword of the
          Spirit, which is the Word of God.| Here is a quiver, filled with
          innumerable arrows, and God has put into our hands the bow of prayer,
          by which we may shoot them, drawing that bow by the arm of faith
          against our innumerable foes. What weapons of holy warfare do you want
          better than those which this sacred armoury supplies? Read the last
          chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and see how the apostle, with
          a triumphant glorying, takes you through God's armoury, and bids you
          look at the various pieces of armor, and the various weapons that are
          provided for you. If you lose the battle, it is not for want of being
          armed, and if you desert from the ranks, it is not for the want of
          bows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is more. Another translation seems to show that these
          Ephraimites were very skillful in the use of the bow, and yet they
          turned back. Oh! may God grant that none of us who have preached to
          others, and preached to others with fluency and zeal may ever have our
          own weapons turned against us. I may make a confession here now. I
          have read some of my own utterances and have trembled as I have read
          them, and afterwards I have wept over them, not wanting to alter them,
          not regretting them, but fearing and trembling lest I should have my
          own words used in judgment against me at the last great day, for there
          can be no more dreadful thing that for a man to have known and taught
          the Word to others, and then to hear the Master say, -- just listen to
          it, -- |Thou wicked servant! Out of thine own mouth will I condemn
          thee!| O God! Condemn me out of anybody's mouth rather than out of my
          own. It will be a dreadful thing to have known how to use the bow, and
          yet not to win the victory one's-self; to have been a sort of
          drill-sergeant to God's people, showing them how to use the weapons,
          and then not to have fought the battle one's-self! This will be a
          terrible thing! Some of you know how to use this Bible. You are
          acquainted with it, you have studied its doctrines, you know the
          points of divinity and theology, you are well read up in the teachings
          of God's Word; you know how to use the bow. And some of you pray very
          sweetly at prayer-meeting. Ah! beloved, what I said about myself may
          well apply to you. Some of you are Sunday-school teachers and others
          tract distributors, and you all know how to use the bow. I hope I can
          say to you who sit here that I have, like Saul, taught you to use the
          bow. We have sought to teach you young men to use God's Word both in
          prayer and in other exercises of your holy faith; but, beloved, if you
          turn back, the art, which you have learned, shall rise up in judgment
          against you to condemn you! If as professors taught the use of God's
          Word you are marched out to fight, but have not courage enough for the
          conflict, and turn your backs and slink into inglorious ease or into
          vain-glorious self-righteousness, or into false glorious pleasure, oh!
          how terrible must be your ruin at the last! May you not be like the
          children of Ephraim, who, though skilled in the use of the bow, yet
          turned back in the day of battle! This, then, is who they were.
        </p>
        <p>IV. And ask ye now -- WHY DID THEY DO IT?</p>
        <p>
          Why did they, indeed? We might well have been at a loss to tell, for
          they were armed and carried bows. What then was the reason? The Word
          of God tells us and gives us three reasons. You will find them in the
          verses following the text. |They kept not the covenant of God and
          refused to walk in his law, and forgot his works, and his wonders that
          he had showed them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |They kept not the covenant.| Oh! that great covenant, |ordered in all
          things and sure,| when you can fall back upon that how it strengthens
          you! When you can read in it eternal thoughts of divine love to you,
          and can hear Jesus say, |I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they
          shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.| How
          it encourages you to go forward! You cannot be killed, you are
          invulnerable, you have been dipped in the covenant stream that makes
          you invulnerable from head to foot. Why, then, should you fear to face
          the foe? If you forget that covenant you will soon turn back, and so
          prove that you are not in it; but the remembrance of it gives strength
          to God's people to persevere, since they feel that God's purpose is
          that they shall persevere, and so win the victory. The covenant,
          however, not only secures safety, but it also provides all sorts of
          blessings. If a Christian always had his eye on the covenant
          storehouse he could never desert his God for the world. Will a man
          leave a treasury that is full of gold to go to a beggar's cottage for
          money? Will a man turn from the flowing stream that comes cool and
          fresh from Lebanon's melting snow to go and drink of some filthy
          stagnant pool? No, not he, and when a man knows the treasures of grace
          that are in Christ Jesus, and remembers that it pleased the Father
          that in him should all fullness dwell, and that he hath made him a
          covenant for the people, will such a man turn back? Assuredly not, but
          every promise of the covenant will enable him to face his foes and
          prevent his turning back in the day of battle. Perhaps, however, the
          covenant which we forget is the covenant we feel we made with Christ
          in the day when we said, |My beloved is mine, and I am his,| when we
          give ourselves up in a full surrender, body, soul, and spirit, to God.
          Oh! let us never forget that covenant! Supposing we should lose our
          character for Christ's sake? Did we not give Christ our character to
          begin with? You are of no use in the ministry, my dear brother, if you
          are not quite willing to be called a fool, to be called a thief, or
          even to be called a devil! You will never be successful if you are
          afraid of being pelted. The true minister often finds his pulpit to be
          a place but little preferable to a pillory, and he is content to stand
          there, feeling that all the abuse and blasphemy which may come upon
          him are only the means by which the world recognises and proves its
          recognition of a God-sent man. Oh! to rest upon the covenant which is
          made in grace, and to hold fast the covenant which Christ has
          compelled us to make with him, resolved that even should he take all
          away, our joy, our comfort, and our ease, we will still stand to it,
          and still keep the covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why they turned back was that |they refused to walk in
          his law.| When we get a proud heart we very soon get beaten, for with
          the face of a lion, but the heart of a deer, such an one is afraid of
          the world. If I am willing to do what God tells me, as he tells me,
          when he tells me, and because he tells me, I shall not turn back in
          the day of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also seem to have turned back because they had bad memories.
          |They forgat his works, and the wonders that he had showed them.| My
          dear friends, we the members of this church have seen many of God's
          wonders, and have rejoiced in them, and if we were to forget these we
          should lack one means of comfort in our own darkness. Some of you have
          had very wonderful manifestations of the Lord's kindness, and if you
          forget all these I should not wonder if you should prove to be a mere
          professor and turn your back, for God's true people are like that
          Mary, whom all generations call |blessed,| they treasure these things
          in their hearts. We ought to stir up our remembrances of God's
          loving-kindness, for if we do not it will soon he a powerful reason
          for our turning back in the day of battle. Oh! have we not fought in
          days gone by, and shall we now be afraid? Have we not slain old Giant
          Grim? Did we not fight with dragons and with lions? Have we not gone
          through the Valley of the Shadow of Death? Have we not had a conflict
          with Apollyon himself foot to foot, and shall Giant Despair or his
          wife Mrs. Diffidence make us afraid? No, in the name of God we will
          use the good old sword, the true Jerusalem blade that we wielded
          aforetime, and we shall yet again be more than conquerors through him
          that loved us. Let us, then, not forget God's works in the days of
          yore, lest we fail to trust him in the days that are to come. This was
          why they turned back.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now the last enquiry is -- WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THEIR TURNING
          BACK?
        </p>
        <p>
          One result of their turning back was, that their father mourned over
          them. We are told, in the passage I quoted first, that |Ephraim their
          father mourned for them many days.| What a lamentation it brings into
          the Christian church when a professor falls! There is one heart, which
          feels it with peculiar poignancy -- the heart of him who thought he
          was the spiritual father of the person so falling. There are no griefs
          connected with our work like the grief of mourning over fallen
          professors, especially if these happen to be ministers, men who are
          armed and carry bows, for when they turn back, well accoutred and well
          skilled in war, it is heart breaking work indeed! I do not exaggerate,
          but I know I only speak the sober truth, when I say that if I could
          submit to any form of corporeal torture that I have ever heard of, I
          would be willing to bear it sooner than submit to the torture I have
          sometimes felt over members of this church, or what is worse, over
          young men educated in our College, or what is worse still, over
          ministers who have been for some time settled over their flocks. If at
          any time you desire to be malicious towards the man whom you look upon
          as your spiritual father; if you would send an arrow through his very
          liver and smite him with a dagger in the core of his heart, you have
          nothing to do but I to turn back in the day of battle and you have
          done it. It were better that you had never been born than that you
          should go back to the world. It were better that you should be taken
          out of this house a corpse than that you should live to disgrace the
          profession which you have espoused, especially those of you who stand
          in a prominent place. O God, keep us who witness before the multitude,
          keep us by thine eternal power, keep us as the apple of thine eye,
          hide us beneath the shadow of thy wings, or else we who are chief and
          foremost, though armed and carrying bows, shall yet turn back in the
          day of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another result, which you perhaps will think more important far, was
          that owing to their turning back the enemy remained. Owing to many
          Christians not doing what they ought to do in the day of battle,
          Romanism is still in this land, and infidelity is rife. If in the days
          of Elizabeth and Cranmer men had acted up to the light they then had,
          we should not be as we now are, a semi-Popish nation. Had Luther
          himself been faithful to some of the light to which he shut his eyes,
          he might have inaugurated a more perfect Reformation than that for
          which we are still devoutly grateful to God and for which we always
          cherish his memory. There was a want of thoroughness even in that day.
          And at the present moment, if some of our brethren were but faithful
          to their own convictions, they would not be bolstering up an alliance
          of the State with a depraved Church; they would not dare to perform
          some ceremonies which are atrociously bad, and many of us, if we acted
          according to our inward monitor, would not do many things which we are
          now doing. Oh! may God give us grace to smite the foe! What has sin to
          do in this world? Christ has bought the world with his blood, and oh!
          for grace to clear sin out of Christ's heritage! The earth is the
          Lord's, and the kingdoms thereof, the world and they that dwell
          therein; and if we were but faithful to God we should not turn back in
          the day of battle, and Rome and all our foes would be slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, if we did not turn our backs, the country would be
          conquered for Christ. I do not like the way in which some brethren
          say, that if we were more faithful half London would be saved. I say
          that I believe God's purpose is achieved, but still we are bound to
          speak of our sins according to their tendencies, and the tendency of
          our want of confidence in God, and our not boldly persevering, is to
          destroy souls. Paul talked once of destroying with meat him for whom
          Christ died, that being the tendency to destroy such souls if they
          could be destroyed. So humanly speaking, the darkness of the world at
          present is owing to the unfaithfulness of the church, and if the
          church had been as true to Christ as she was in the first century,
          long ere this there would not have been a village without the gospel,
          nor a single empire in the world in which the truth had not been
          proclaimed. It is our turning back in the day of battle that leaves
          Canaan unconquered for our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, worse than this, the ark itself was actually taken. My dear
          friends, those of you who are armed and carry bows, men of learning,
          men who understand the Scriptures, 1 do pray you, do not turn back
          just now, for just now seems to be a time when the ark of God will be
          taken. It can never really be so, but still we must mind that it be
          not the tendency of our actions. We are in great danger from what some
          people will not believe, but what is most certainly a fact, and that
          is the marvellous increase of Popery in this land. There are certain
          brethren who are always harping upon this one string, till we have
          grown sick of the theme, but, without at all endorsing their alarm, I
          believe there is quite enough for the most quiet and confident spirit
          to be alarmed at. The thing has become monstrous, and there is need to
          awaken the anxious care and the earnest efforts of God's church. You
          need not be long without good evidence of this. Every nerve is being
          strained by Rome to win England to itself, and, on the other hand,
          while we have less neology, and less of all sorts of scepticism
          throughout the whole country, I am afraid that we have more of it than
          we used to have inside the church itself. There are many doctrines
          that are now matters of question, which I never heard questioned ten
          years ago. I am not altogether sorry for this, but rather glad,
          because there are some doctrines which are not preached now, but which
          will be preached more in future in consequence of doubts being thrown
          upon them. But it is a very ominous sign of the times, that most of
          those truths which we have been accustomed to accept as being the
          received and orthodox faith of Christendom are now being questioned,
          and questioned too by men who are not to be despised, men who from
          their evident earnestness, from their deep knowledge, and from their
          close attention to the matter, deserve a hearing in the forum of
          common sense, even if they do not deserve it from spiritual men. We
          must all of us hold fast the truth now. If there is a man who has got
          a truth, let him draw his bow and shoot his arrows now, and not turn
          back in the day of battle. Now for your arrows! Now for your arrows!
          The more our foes shall conspire against Christ, the more do you make
          war against them. Give them double for their double; reward them as
          they reward you. Spare no arrows against Babylon. |Happy shall he be
          that taketh thy little ones and dasheth them against the stones.|
          Happy shall he be who slays the little errors, who kills the minor
          falsehoods, who does battle against Popery in every shape and form,
          and against, infidelity in all its phases! If we do not come to the
          front now, the ark of God, as far as we are concerned, will be taken!
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, worst of all, we shall hear the Philistines shouting while
          God's church is weeping! The Philistines are good hands at shouting.
          They shout rather loudly about nothing, but when they get a little
          they bark loudly enough then. If they see but one Christian turn back
          what rejoicing there is! They ring the bells and make great mirth over
          the fall of the very least among us, but if those of us who are armed
          and carry bows should turn back in the day of battle, oh |Tell it not
          in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters
          of Philistia rejoice, lest the sons of the uncircumcised triumph!| God
          grant that we may never make mirth for hell. If Satan must have
          merriment may he find it anywhere rather than in us. Oh! may we stand
          at last, and, having done all, may we still stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, brethren. If we do not stand fast, you know what will
          come of it. Supposing the churches of which we are members do not
          stand fast, what will come of you and what of me? What became of
          Shiloh? What became of Ephraim? Instead of the ark being any longer in
          the custody of Ephraim it was taken away from Shiloh, and God
          transferred the custody of it to Judah, and it rested upon Mount Zion
          under the government of King David. So, mark you, whenever a church
          becomes unfaithful, and turns back in the day of battle, God takes
          away from it the keeping of his ark and entrusts it to others. |I have
          looked upon a neighbor of thine,| saith he, |who is better than thou,|
          and so he takes the sword and gives it to David, and thus perhaps may
          he do with us. There are many churches that were once flourishing but
          now are deserted altogether. So it may be with us individually, and
          with the churches at large unless we are faithful to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I have said nothing to the unconverted. My drift seemed to be to
          speak to professing believers. Some of you say you never went to this
          war, and therefore you will not turn back; you never made a
          profession. Ah! dear friends, it will be a very poor excuse at the
          last great day to say, |I never made a profession.| Did you ever hear
          of a thief being brought up at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor
          who said, when he was accused of being a thief, |Why, my Lord, I am
          not a very honest man; I never professed to be; I never professed that
          I would not pick people's pockets; I never professed that I would not
          steal a watch if I had the chance; I was regularly known as a thief; I
          never professed to be anything else, therefore you cannot blame me.|
          If a man should make such a defense as that, I should think it very
          likely that the Lord Mayor would give him an extra six months, and I
          think it would serve him very well right. You smile at this, but the
          very same argument may be applied to you. |Well,| you say, |you know I
          do not make any profession of religion;| that is to say, you do not
          make any pretense of serving and loving the God who made you, who gave
          you life, and has kept and preserved you in it; you do not make any
          profession of being washed in the precious blood of Christ; you do not
          make a profession of being on the road to hell. Well, may God save you
          from that excuse, and may he give you grace to look it in the face and
          say, |Well, I do not dare even to hope that I am saved; I know I am
          not.| Then, my brother, if you are not saved, you are lost. I would
          like to stop while you turn that thought over, and when you have done
          so I would say, |The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which
          was lost.|
        </p>
        <p>
          May God's eternal mercy seek and save you, and, if it be his will, may
          he find you, and lead you to put your trust in Jesus Christ, and
          resting upon him, and looking to his cross, you shall not, as the
          children of Ephraim did, |turn back in the day of battle.|
