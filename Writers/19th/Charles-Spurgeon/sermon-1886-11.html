          |Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, O
          Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people
          of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, saith the
          Lord of hosts: according to the word that I covenanted with you when
          ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.|
          -- Haggai 2:4-5.
        </p>
        <p>
          SATAN is always doing his utmost to stay the work of God. He hindered
          these Jews from building the temple; and to-day he endeavours to
          hinder the people of God from spreading the gospel. A spiritual temple
          is to be builded for the Most High, and if by any means the evil one
          can delay its uprising he will stick at nothing: if he can take us off
          from working with faith and courage for the glory of God he will be
          sure to do it. He is very cunning, and knows how to change his
          argument and yet keep to his design: little cares he how he works, so
          long as he can hurt the cause of God. In the case of the Jewish people
          on their return from captivity he sought to prevent the building of
          the temple by making them selfish and worldly, so that every many was
          eager to build his own house, and cared nothing for the house of the
          Lord. Each family pleaded its own urgent needs. In returning to a
          long-deserted and neglected land, much had to be done to make up for
          lost time; and to provide suitably for itself every family needed all
          its exertions. They carried this thrift and self-providing to a great
          extreme, and secured for themselves luxuries, while the foundations of
          the temple which had been laid years before remained as they were, or
          became still more thickly covered up with rubbish. The people could
          not be made to bestir themelves to build a house of God, for they
          answered to every exhortation, |The time is not come, the time that
          the Lord's house should be built.| A more convenient season was always
          looming in the future, but it never came. Just now it was too hot,
          further it was too cold; at one time the wet season was just setting
          in, and it was of no use to begin, and soon the fair weather required
          that they should be in their own fields. Like some in our day, they
          saw to themselves first, and God's turn was very long in coming; hence
          the prophet cried, |Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled
          houses, and this house lie waste?|
        </p>
        <p>
          By the mouth of His servant Haggai stern rebukes were uttered, and the
          whole people were aroused. We read in verse twelve of the first
          chapter, |Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
          Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed
          the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,
          as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the
          Lord.| All hands were put to the work; course after course of stone
          began to rise; and then another stumbling-block was thrown in the way
          of the workers. The older folks remarked that this was a very small
          affair compared with the temple of Solomon, of which their fathers had
          told them; in fact, their rising building was nothing at all, and not
          worthy to be called a temple. The prophet describes the feeling in the
          verse which precedes our text. |Who is left among you that saw this
          house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your
          eyes in comparison of it as nothing?| Feeling that their work would be
          very poor and insignificant, the people had little heart to go on.
          Being discouraged by the humiliating contrast, they began to be slack;
          and as they were quite willing to accept any excuse, and here was an
          excuse ready made for them, they would soon have been at a standstill
          had not the prophet met the wiles of the arch-enemy with another word
          from the Lord. Nothing so confounds the evil one as the voice of the
          Eternal. Our Lord Himself defeated Satan by the word of the Lord; and
          the prophet Haggai did the same. The subtle craft of the enemy is
          defeated by the wisdom of the Most High, which reveals itself in plain
          words of honest statement. The Lord cuts the knots which bind His
          people, and sets them at liberty to do His will. He did this by
          assuring them that He was with them. Twice the voice was heard -- |I
          am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.| They were also assured that
          what they builded was accepted, and that the Lord meant to fill the
          new house with glory; yea, He meant to light it up with a glory
          greater than that which honoured the temple of Solomon. They were not
          spending their strength for nought, but were labouring with divine
          help and favour. Thus they were encouraged to put their shoulders to
          the work: the walls rose in due order, and God was glorified in the
          building up of His Zion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The present times are, in many respects, similar to those of Haggai.
          History certainly repeats itself within the church of God as well as
          outside of it; and therefore the messages of God need to be repeated
          also. The words of some almost-forgotten prophet may be re-delivered
          by the watchman of the Lord in these present days, and be a timely
          word for the present emergency. We are not free from the worldliness
          which puts self first and God nowhere, else our various enterprises
          would be more abundantly supplied with the silver and the gold which
          are the Lord's, but which even professing Christians reserve for
          themselves. When this selfish greed is conquered, then comes in a
          timorous depression. Among those who have escaped from worldliness
          there is apt to be too much despondency, and men labour feebly as for
          a cause which is doomed to failure. This last evil must be cured. I
          pray that our text may this morning flame from the Lord's own mouth
          with all the fire which once blazed about it. May faint hearts be
          encouraged and drowsy spirits be aroused, as we hear the Lord say, |My
          spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall enter fully upon the subject, by the assistance of the Holy
          Spirit, by calling your attention to discouragement forbidden. Then I
          shall speak of encouragement imparted; and, having done so, I shall
          linger with this blessed text, which overflows with comfort, and shall
          speak, in the third place, of encouragement further applied. Oh that
          our Lord, who knows how to speak a word in season to him that is
          weary, may cheer the hearts of seekers by what shall be spoken under
          this last head of discourse!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To begin with, here is DISCOURAGEMENT FORBIDDEN. Discouragement
          comes readily enough to us poor mortals who are occupied in the work
          of God, seeing it is a work of faith, a work of difficulty, a work
          above our capacity, and a work much opposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discouragement is very natural: it is a native of the soil of manhood.
          To believe is supernatural, faith is the work of the Spirit of God; to
          doubt is natural to fallen men; for we have within us an evil heart of
          unbelief. It is abominably wicked, I grant you; but still it is
          natural, because of the downward tendency of our depraved hearts.
          Discouragement towards good things is a weed that grows without
          sowing. To be faint-hearted and downcast happens to some of us when we
          are half drowned in this heavy atmosphere, and it also visits us on
          the wings of the east wind. It takes little to make some hands hang
          down: a word or a look will do it. I do not, therefore, excuse it; but
          the rather condemn myself for having a nature prone to such evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discouragement may come and does come to us, as it did to these
          people, from a consideration of the great things which God deserves at
          our hands, and the small things which we are able to render. When in
          Haggai's days the people thought of Jehovah, and of the temple for
          Him, and then looked upon the narrow space which had been enclosed,
          and the common stones which had been laid for foundations, they were
          ashamed. Where were those hewn stones and costly stones which, of old,
          Solomon brought from far? They said within themselves, |This house is
          unworthy of Jehovah: what do we by labouring thus?| Have you not felt
          the depressing weight of what is so surely true? Brethren, all that we
          do is little for our God; far too little for Him that loved us and
          gave Himself for us. For Him that poured out His soul unto death on
          our behalf the most splendid service, the most heroic self-denial, are
          all too little; and we feel it so. Alabaster boxes of precious
          ointment are too mean a gift. It does not occur to our fervent spirit
          to imagine that there can be any waste when our best boxes are broken
          and the perfume is poured out lavishly for Him. What we do fear is
          that our alabaster boxes are too few, and that our ointment is not
          precious enough. When we have done our utmost in declaring the glory
          of Jesus, we have felt that words are too poor and mean to set forth
          our adorable Lord. When we have prayed for His kingdom we have been
          disgusted with our own prayers; and all the efforts we have put forth
          in connection with any part of His service have seemed too few, too
          feeble for us to hope for acceptance. Thus have we been discouraged.
          The enemy has worked upon us by this means, yet he has made us argue
          very wrongly. Because we could not do much, we have half resolved to
          do nothing! Because what we did was so poor, we were inclined to quit
          the work altogether! This is evidently absurd and wicked. The enemy
          can use humility for his purpose as well as pride. Whether he makes us
          think too much or too little of our work, it is all the same to him as
          long as he can get us off from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is significant that the man with one talent went and hid his Lord's
          money in the earth. He knew that it was but one, and for that reason
          he was the less afraid to bury it. Perhaps he argued that the interest
          on one talent could never come to much, and would never be noticed
          side by side with the result of five or ten talents; and he might as
          well bring nothing at all to his Lord as bring so little. Perhaps he
          might not have wrapped it up if it had not been so small that a napkin
          could cover it. The smallness of our gifts may be a temptation to us.
          We are consciously so weak and so insignificant, compared with the
          great God and His great cause, that we are discouraged, and think it
          vain to attempt anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the enemy contrasts our work with that of others, and with
          that of those who have gone before us. We are doing so little as
          compared with other people, therefore let us give up. We cannot build
          like Solomon, therefore let us not build at all. Yet, brethren, there
          is a falsehood in all this; for, in truth, nothing is worthy of God.
          The great works of others, and even the amazing productions of
          Solomon, all fell short of His glory. What house could man build for
          God? What are cedar, and marble, and gold as compared with the glory
          of the Most High? Though the house was |exceeding magnifical,| yet the
          Lord God had of old dwelt within curtains, and never was His worship
          more glorious than within the tent of badger's skins; indeed, as soon
          as the great house was built, true religion declined. What of all
          human work can be worthy of the Lord? Our little labours do but share
          the insignificance of greater things, and therefore we ought not to
          withhold them: yet here is the temptation from which we must pray to
          be delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tendency to depreciate the present because of the glories of the
          past is also injurious. The old people looked back to the days of the
          former temple, even as we are apt to look upon the times of the great
          preachers of the past. What work was done in those past days? What
          Sabbaths were enjoyed then! What converts were added to the church!
          What days of refreshing were then vouchsafed! Everything has declined,
          decreased, degenerated! As for the former days, they beheld a race of
          giants, who are now succeeded by pigmies. We look at one of these
          great men, and cry,
        </p>
        <p>|Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
        <p>Like a Colossus; and we petty men</p>
        <p>Walk under his huge legs, and peep about</p>
        <p>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.|</p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, we must not allow this sense of littleness to hamper
          us; for God can bless our littleness, and use it for His glory. I
          notice that the great men of the past thought of themselves even as we
          think of ourselves. Certainly they were not more self-confident than
          we are. I find in the story of the brave days of old the same
          confessions and the same lamentations which we utter now. It is true
          that in a spiritual strength we are not what our fathers were; I fear
          the Puritanic holiness and truthfulness of doctrine are dying out,
          while adherence to principle is far from common; but our fathers had
          also faults and follies to mourn over, and they did mourn over them
          most sincerely. Instead of being discouraged because what we do is
          unworthy of God, and insignificant compared with what was done by
          others, let us gather up our strength to reform our errors, and reach
          to higher attainments. Let us throw our heart and soul into the work
          of the Lord, and yet do something more nearly in accordance with our
          highest ideal of what our God deserves of us. Let us excel our
          ancestors. Let us aspire to be even more godly, more conscientious,
          and more sound in the faith than they were, for the Spirit of God
          remaineth with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, it is clear that discouragement can be produced by these
          reasons, and yet they are a mere sample of a host of arguments which
          work in the same direction: hence discouragement is very common.
          Haggai was sent to speak to Zerubbabel, the governor, and to Joshua,
          the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people. The great man
          may become discouraged: he that leads the van has his fainting fits;
          even Elijah cries, |Let me die!| The consecrated servant of God whose
          life is a priesthood is apt to grow discouraged, too: standing at
          God's altar, he sometimes trembles for the ark of the Lord. The
          multitude of the people are all too apt to suffer from panic, and to
          flee at the sight of the enemy. How many are they who say, |The old
          truth cannot exceed: the cause of orthodoxy is desperate; we had
          better yield to the modern spirit|! This faith-heartedness is so
          common that it has been the plague of Israel from her first day until
          now. They were discouraged at the Red Sea, at the mere rattling of
          Pharaoh's chariots; they were discouraged when they found no water;
          they were discouraged when they had eaten up the bread which they
          brought out of Egypt; they were discouraged when they heard of the
          giants, and of the cities walled to heaven. I need not lengthen the
          wretched catalogue. What has not cowardice done? The fearful and
          unbelieving have brought terrible disasters upon our camps.
          Discouragement is the national epidemic of our Israel. |Being armed
          and carrying bows| we turn back in the day of battle. This is as
          common among Christians as consumption among the inhabitants of this
          foggy island. Oh that God would save us all from distrust, and cause
          us to quit ourselves like men!
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever discouragement comes in it is dreadfully weakening. I am sure
          it is weakening, because the prophet was bidden to say three times to
          the governor, high priest, and people, |Be strong.| This proves that
          they had become weak. Being discouraged, their hands hung down, and
          their knees were feeble. Faith girds us with omnipotence, but unbelief
          makes everything hang loose and limp about us. Distrust, and thou wilt
          fail in everything; believe, and according to thy faith so shall it be
          unto thee. To lead a discouraged people to the Holy War is as
          difficult as for Xerxes' commanders to conduct the Persian troops to
          battle against the Greeks. The vassals of the great king were driven
          to the conflict by whips and sticks, for they were afraid to fight: do
          you wonder that they were defeated? A church that needs constant
          exhorting and compelling accomplishes nothing. The Greeks had no need
          of blows and threats, for each man was a lion, and courted the
          encounter, however great the odds against him. Each Spartan fought con
          amore; he was never more at home than when contending for the altars
          and the hearths of his country. We want Christian men of this same
          sort, who have faith in their principles, faith in the doctrines of
          grace, faith in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost;
          and who therefore contend earnestly for the faith in these days when
          piety is mocked at from the pulpit, and the gospel is sneered at by
          professional preachers. We need men who love the truth, to whom it is
          dear as their lives; men into whose hearts the old doctrine is burned
          by the hand of God's Spirit through a deep experience of its necessity
          and of its power. We need no more of those who will parrot what they
          are taught, but we want men who will speak what they know. Oh, for a
          troop of men like John Knox, heroes of the martyr and covenanter
          stock! Then would Jehovah of hosts have a people to serve Him who
          would be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discouragement not only weakens men, but it takes them off from the
          service of God. It is significant that the prophet said to them, |Be
          strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work.| They had
          ceased to build: they had begun to talk and argue, but they had laid
          down the trowel. They were extremely wise in their observations, and
          criticisms, and prophecies; but the walls did not rise. One person
          knew exactly how big the former temple was; another declared that
          their present architect was not up to the mark, and that the structure
          was not built in a scientific manner: one objected to this, and
          another to that; but everyone was wiser than all the rest, and sneered
          at old-fashioned ways. It is always so when we are discouraged: we
          cease from the work of the Lord, and waste time in talk and
          nonsensical refinements. May the Lord take away discouragement from
          any of you who now suffer from it! I suppose some of you do feel it,
          for at times it creeps over my heart and makes me go with heaviness to
          my work. I believe that God's truth will come to the front yet, but it
          hath many adversaries to-day. All sorts of unbeliefs are being hatched
          out from under the wings of |modern thought.| The gospel seems to be
          regarded as a nose of wax, to be altered and shaped by every man who
          wishes to show his superior skill. Nor is it in doctrine alone, but in
          practice also, that the times are out of joint. Separateness from the
          world, and holy living, are to give place to gaiety and theatre-going.
          To follow Christ fully has gone out of fashion with many of those from
          whom we once hoped better things. Yet are there some who waver not,
          some who are willing to be in the right with two or three. For my own
          part, even should I find none around me of the same mind, I shall not
          budge an inch from the old truth, nor sweat a hair of fear of its
          overthrow; but I shall abide confident that the eternal God, whose
          truth we know and hold, will vindicate Himself ere long, and turn the
          wisdom of the world into babble, and its boasting into confusion.
          Blessed is the man who shall be able to stand fast by his God in these
          evil days. Let us not in any wise be discouraged. |Be strong; be
          strong; be strong,| sounds as a threefold voice from the Triune God.
          |Fear not| comes as a sweet cordial to the faint: therefore let no
          man's heart fail him. Thus much about the discouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, here is THE ENCOURAGEMENT IMPARTED, which is the grand
          part of our text. |According to the word that I covenanted with you
          when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye
          not.| God remembers His covenant and stands to His ancient promises.
          When the people came out of Egypt, the Lord was with them by His
          Spirit; hence He spoke to them by Moses, and through Moses He guided,
          and judged, and taught them. He was with them also by His Spirit in
          inspiring Bezaleel and Aholiab, as to the works of art which adorned
          the tabernacle. God always finds the workmen for His work, and by His
          Spirit fits them for it. The Spirit of God rested upon the elders who
          were ordained to relieve Moses of his great burden. The Lord was also
          with His people in the fiery cloudy pillar which was conspicuous in
          the midst of the camp. His presence was their glory and their defence.
          This is a type of the presence of the Spirit with the church. At the
          present day, if we hold the truth of God, if we live in obedience to
          His holy commands, if we are spiritually-minded, if we cry unto God in
          believing prayer, if we have faith in His covenant and in His Son, the
          Holy Spirit abideth among us. The Holy Ghost descended upon the church
          at Pentecost, and He has never gone back again: there is no record of
          the Spirit's return to heaven. He will abide with the true church
          evermore. This is our hope for the present struggle. The Spirit of God
          remaineth with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          To what end, my brethren, is this Spirit with us? Let us think of
          this, that we may be encouraged at this time. The Spirit of God
          remaineth among you to aid and assist the ministry which He has
          already given. Oh, that the prayers of God's people would always go up
          for God's ministers, that they may speak with a divine power and
          influence which none shall be able to gainsay! We look too much for
          clever men; we seek out fluent and flowery speakers; we sigh for men
          cultured and trained in all the knowledge of the heathen: nay, but if
          we sought more for unction, for divine authority, and for the power
          which doth hedge about the man of God, how much wiser should we be!
          Oh,m that all of us who profess to preach the gospel would learn to
          speak in entire dependence upon the direction of the Holy Spirit, not
          daring to utter our own words, but even trembling lest we should do
          so, and committing ourselves to that secret influence without which
          nothing will be powerful upon the conscience or converting to the
          heart. Know ye not the difference between the power that cometh of
          human oratory, and that which cometh by the divine energy which speaks
          so to the heart that men cannot resist it? We have forgotten this too
          much. It were better to speak six words in the power of the Holy Ghost
          than to preach seventy years of sermons without the Spirit. He who
          rested on those who have gone to their reward in heaven can rest this
          day upon our ministers and bless our evangelists, if we will but seek
          it of Him. Let us cease to grieve the Spirit of God, and look to him
          for help to the faithful ministers who are yet spared to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This same Spirit who of old gave to His church eminent teachers can
          raise up other and more useful men. The other day, a brother from
          Wales told me of the great men he remembered: he said that he had
          never heard such a one as Christmas Evans, who surpasses all men when
          he was in the hwyl. I asked him if he knew another Welsh minister who
          preached like Christmas Evans. |No,| he said, |we have no such man in
          Wales in our days.| So in England we have neither Wesley nor
          Whitefield, nor any of their order; yet, as with God is the residue of
          the Spirit, He can fetch out from some chimney-corner another
          Christmas Evans, or find in our Sunday-school another George
          Whitefield, who shall declare the gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down
          from heaven. Let us never fear for the future, or despair for the
          present, since the Spirit of God remaineth with us. What if the
          growing error of the age should have silenced the last tongue that
          speaks out the old gospel, let not faith be weakened. I hear the tramp
          of legions of soldiers of the cross. I hear the clarion voices of
          hosts of preachers. |The Lord gave the word; great was the company of
          those that published it.| Have faith in God through our Lord Jesus
          Christ! When He ascended on high He led captivity captive, and
          received gifts for men. He then gave apostles, teachers, preachers,
          and evangelists, and He can do the like again. Let us fall back upon
          the eternal God, and never be discouraged for an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all. The Holy Spirit being with us, He can move the whole
          church to exercise its varied ministries. This is one of the things we
          want very much -- that every member of the church should recognise
          that he is ordained to service. Everyone in Christ, man or woman, hath
          some testimony to bear, some warning to give, some deed to do in the
          name of the holy child Jesus; and if the Spirit of God be poured out
          upon our young men and our maidens, each one will be aroused to
          energetic service. Both small and great will be in earnest, and the
          result upon the slumbering masses of our population will surprise us
          all. Sometimes we lament that the churches are so dull. There is an
          old proverb which says of So-and-so, that he was |as sound asleep as a
          church.| I suppose there is nothing that can sleep so soundly as a
          church. But yet the Spirit of God still remaineth, and therefore
          churches go to be awakened. I mean that not only in part but as a
          whole, a church may be quickened. The dullest professor, the most
          slovenly believer, the most captious and useless member of a church,
          may yet be turned to good account. I see them like a stack of faggots,
          piled up, dead and dry. Oh for the fire! We will have a blaze out of
          them yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, brood over the dark, disordered
          church as once thou didst over chaos, and order shall come out of
          confusion, and the darkness shall fly before the light. Only let the
          Spirit be with us, and we have all that is wanted for victory. Give us
          His presence, and everything else will come in its due season for the
          profitable service of the entire church.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Spirit be with us, there will come multitudinous conversions.
          We cannot get at |the lapsed masses,| as they are pedantically called.
          We cannot stir the crass infidelity of the present age: no, we cannot,
          but He can. All things are possible with God. If you walk down to our
          bridges at a certain hour of the day you will see barges and vessels
          lying in the mud; and all the king's horses and all the king's men
          cannot stir them. Wait until the tide comes in, and they will walk the
          water like things of life. The living flood accomplishes at once what
          no mortals can do. And so to-day our churches cannot stir. What shall
          we do? Oh, that the Holy Spirit would come with a flood-tide of His
          benign influences, as He will if we will but believe in Him; as He
          must if we will but cry unto Him; as He shall if we will cease to
          grieve Him. Everything will be even as the saints desire when the Lord
          of saints is with us. The hope of the continuance and increase of the
          church lies in the remaining of the Spirit with us. The hope of the
          salvation of London lies in the wonder-working Spirit. Let us bow our
          heads and worship the omnipotent Spirit who deigns to work in us, by
          us, and with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, brethren, if this should happen -- and I see not why it should
          not -- then we may expect to see the church put on her beautiful
          garments; then shall she begin to clear herself of th errors which now
          defile her; then shall she press to her bosom the truths which she now
          begins to forget; then will she go back to the pure fount of
          inspiration and drink from the Scriptures of truth; and then out of
          the midst of her shall flow no turbid streams, but rivers of living
          water. If the Holy Ghost will work among us we shall rejoice in the
          Lord, and glory in the name of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          When once the Spirit of God putteth forth His might all things else
          will be in accord with Him. Notice that in the rest of the chapter --
          which I shall read now, not as relating to that temple at all, but to
          the church of God -- there is great comfort given to us. If the Holy
          Spirit be once given, then we may expect providence to co-operate with
          the church of God. Read verse 6: |Yet once, it is a little while, and
          I will shake heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land. I
          will shake all nations.| Great commotions will co-operate with the
          Holy Spirit. We may expect that God will work for His people in an
          extraordinary fashion if they will but be faithful to Him. Empires
          will collapse, and times will change, for the truth's sake. Expect the
          unexpected, reckon upon that which is unlikely, if it be necessary for
          the growth of the kingdom. Of old the earth helped the woman when the
          dragon opened his mouth to drown her with the floods that he cast
          forth: unexpected help shall come to us when affairs are at their
          worst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specially do I look for a shaking among the hosts of unbelief. How
          often did the Lord of old rout His enemies without Israel drawing
          sword! The watchword was, |Stand ye still, and see the salvation of
          the Lord.| The adversaries of old fell out among themselves; and they
          will do so again. When Cadmus slew the dragon with his javelin, he was
          bidden to sow its teeth in the earth. When he did so, according to the
          classic fable, he saw rising out of the ground nodding plumes, and
          crested helmets, and broad shoulders of armed men. Up from the earth
          there sprang a host of warriors; but Cadmus needed not to fly; for the
          moment they found their feet, these children of the dragon fell upon
          each other till scarcely one was left. Error, like Saturn, devours its
          own children. Those that fight against the Lord of hosts are not
          agreed among themselves; they shall sheathe their swords in each
          other's bosoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw in the night vision the sea, the deep and broad sea of truth,
          flashing with its silver waves. Lo, a black horse came out of the
          darkness and went down to the deep, threatening to drink it dry. I saw
          him stand there drinking, and swelling as he drank. In his pride he
          trusted that he could snuff up Jordan at a draught. I stood by and saw
          him drink, and then plunge further into the sea, to drink still more.
          Again he plunged in with fury, and soon he lost his footing, and I saw
          him no more, for the deep had swallowed him that boasted that he could
          swallow it. Rest assured that every black horse of error that comes
          forth to swallow up the sea of divine truth shall be drowned therein.
          Wherefore be of good courage. God, who maketh the earth and the
          heavens to shake, shall cause each error to fall like an untimely fig.
        </p>
        <p>
          And next, the Lord in this chapter promises His people that they shall
          have all the supplies they need for His work. They feared that they
          could not build His house, because of their poverty; but, saith the
          Lord of hosts, |The silver and the gold are mine.| When the church of
          God believes in God, and goes forward bravely, she need not trouble as
          to supplies. Her God will provide for her. He that gives the Holy
          Ghost will give gold and silver according as they are needed;
          therefore let us be of good courage. If God is with us, why need we
          fear? One of our English kings once threatened the great city of
          London that if its councillors talked so independently, he would --
          yes -- he would, indeed he would -- take his court away from the city.
          The Lord Mayor on that occasion replied, that if his majesty would
          graciously leave the river Thames behind him, the citizens would try
          to get on without his court. If any say, |If you hold to these
          old-fashioned doctrines you will lose the educated, the wealthy, the
          influential,| we answer: But if we do not lose the godly and the
          presence of the Holy Ghost we are not in the least alarmed. If the
          Holy Ghost remaineth with us, there is a river the streams whereof
          make glad the city of God. Brethren, my heart leaps within me as I
          cry, |The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.|
          |Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
          the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The best comfort of all remained: |The desire of all nations shall
          come.| This was in a measure fulfilled when Jesus came into that
          latter house and caused all holy hearts to sing for gladness; but it
          was not wholly fulfilled in that way; for if you notice, in the ninth
          verse it is written, |The glory of this latter house shall be greater
          than of the former; and in this place will I give peace,| which the
          Lord did not fully do to the second temple, since that was destroyed
          by the Romans. But there is another advent, when |the desire of all
          nations shall come| in power and glory; and this is our highest hope.
          Though truth may be driven back, and error may prevail, Jesus comes,
          and He is the great Lord and patron of truth: He shall judge the world
          in righteousness, and the people in equity. Here is our last resource;
          here are God's reserves. He whom we serve liveth and reigneth for ever
          and ever; and He saith, |Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with
          me, to give every man according as his work shall be.| |Therefore, my
          beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the
          work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain
          in the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I should have done if it had not been that this text seemed to me
          to overflow so much, that it might not only refresh God's people, but
          give drink to thirsty sinners who are seeking the Lord. For a moment
          or two I give myself to ENCOURAGEMENT FURTHER APPLIED.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is at the beginning of every gracious purpose that men have most
          fear, even as these people had who had newly begun to build. When
          first the Holy Spirit begins to strive with a man to lead him to
          Jesus, he is apt to say -- |I cannot; I dare not; it is impossible.
          How can I believe and live?| Now I want to speak to some of you here
          who are willing to find Christ, and to encourage you by the truth that
          the Spirit lives to help you. I would even like to speak to those who
          are not anxious to be saved. I remember that Dr. Payson, an
          exceedingly earnest and useful man of God, once did a singular thing.
          He had been holding inquiry meetings with all sorts of people, and
          great numbers had been saved. At last, one Sunday he gave out that he
          should have a meeting on Monday night of those persons who did not
          desire to be saved; and, strange to say, some twenty persons came who
          did not wish to repent or believe. He spoke to them and said, |I am
          sure that if a little film, thin as a web of the gossamer, were let
          down by God from heaven to each one of you, you would not push it away
          from you. Although it were almost invisible, you would value even the
          slightest connection between you and heaven. Now, your coming to meet
          me to-night is a little link with God. I want it to increase in
          strength till you are joined to the Lord for ever.| He spoke to them
          most tenderly, and God blessed those people who did not desire to be
          saved, so that before the meeting was over they were of another mind.
          The film had become a thicker thread, and it grew and grew until the
          Lord Christ held them by it for ever. Dear friends, the fact of your
          being in the Tabernacle this morning is like that filmy thread: do not
          put it away. Here is your comfort, the Holy Ghost still works with the
          preaching of the word. Do I hear you say, |I cannot feel my need of
          Christ as I want to feel it|? The Spirit remaineth among us. He can
          make you feel more deeply the guilt of sin and your need of pardon.
          |But I have heard so much about conviction and repentance; I do not
          seem to have either of them.| Yet the Spirit remaineth with us, and
          that Spirit is able to work in you the deepest conviction and the
          truest repentance. |O sir, I do not feel as if I could do anything|:
          but the Spirit remaineth with us, and all things that are needful for
          godliness He can give. He can work in you to will and to do of His own
          good pleasure. |But I want to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ unto
          eternal life.| Who made you want to do that? Who but the Holy Spirit?
          Therefore He is still at work with you; and though as yet you do not
          understand what believing is, or else I am persuaded you would believe
          at once, the Spirit of God can instruct you in it. You are blind, but
          He can give you sight; you are paralyzed, but He can give you strength
          -- the Spirit of God remaineth.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Oh, but that doctrine of regeneration staggers me: you know, we must
          be born again.| Yes, we are born again of the Spirit, and the Spirit
          remaineth still with us; He is still mighty to work that wondrous
          change, and to bring you out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom
          of God's dear Son. The Spirit remaineth with us, blessed be His name!
          |Ah, dear sir,| says one, |I want to conquer sin|! Who made you desire
          to conquer sin? Who, but the Spirit that remaineth with us? He will
          give you the sword of the Spirit and teach you how to use it, and He
          will give you both the will and the power to use it successfully.
          Through the Spirit's might you can overcome every sin, even that which
          has dragged you down and disgraced you. The Spirit of God is still
          waiting to help you. When I think of the power of the Spirit of God, I
          look hopefully upon every sinner here this morning. I bless His name
          that He can work in you all that is pleasing in His sight. Some of you
          may be very careless, but He can make you thoughtful. Coming up to
          London to see the Exhibition, I hope you may yourselves become an
          exhibition of divine grace. You think not about things, but He can
          make you feel at this moment a sweet softness stealing over you, until
          you long to be alone and to get home to the old arm-chair and there
          seek the Lord. You can thus be led to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought when I came in here that I should have a picked
          congregation; and so I have. You are one of them. Wherever you come
          from, I want you now to seek the Lord. He has brought you here, and He
          means to bless you. Yield yourselves to Him while His sweet Spirit
          pleads with you. While the heavenly wind softly blows upon you open
          wide every window. You have not felt that you wanted it; but that is
          the sure proof that you need it; for he that does not know his need of
          Christ, is most in need. Open wide your heart that the Spirit may
          teach you your need; above all, breathe the prayer that He would help
          you this morning to look to the Lord Jesus Christ, for |there is life
          in a look at the Crucified One -- there is life at this moment for
          you.| |Oh,| you say, |if I were to begin I should not keep on.| No; if
          you began perhaps you would not; but if He begins with you He will
          keep on. The final perseverance of saints is the result of the final
          perserverance of the Holy Spirit; He perseveres to bless, and we
          persevere in receiving the blessing. If He begins, you have begun with
          a divine power that fainteth not neither is weary. I wish it might so
          happen that on this fifth day of the ninth month, not the prophet
          Haggai, but I, God's servant, may have spoken to you such a word by
          the witness of the Holy Ghost, |From this day will I bless you|! Go
          away with that promise resting upon you. I would like to give a shake
          of the hand to every stranger here this morning, and say, |Brother, in
          the name of the Lord I wish you from this day a blessing.| Amen and
