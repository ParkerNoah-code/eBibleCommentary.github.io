          1. Blending in one the production of their own Æons, and the straying
          and recovery of the sheep [spoken of in the Gospel ], these persons
          endeavour to set forth things in a more mystical style, while they
          refer everything to numbers, maintaining that the universe has been
          formed out of a Monad and a Dyad. And then, reckoning from unity on to
          four, they thus generate the Decad. For when one, two, three, and four
          are added together, they give rise to the number of the ten Æons. And,
          again, the Dyad advancing from itself [by twos] up to six -- two, and
          four, and six -- brings out the Duodecad. Once more, if we reckon in
          the same way up to ten, the number thirty appears, in which are found
          eight, and ten, and twelve. They therefore term the Duodecad --
          because it contains the Episemon, and because the Episemon [so to
          speak] waits upon it -- the passion. And for this reason, because an
          error occurred in connection with the twelfth number, the sheep
          frisked off, and went astray; for they assert that a defection took
          place from the Duodecad. In the same way they oracularly declare, that
          one power having departed also from the Duodecad, has perished; and
          this was represented by the woman who lost the drachma, and, lighting
          a lamp, again found it. Thus, therefore, the numbers that were left,
          viz., nine, as respects the pieces of money, and eleven in regard to
          the sheep, when multiplied together, give birth to the number
          ninety-nine, for nine times eleven are ninety-nine. Wherefore also
          they maintain the word |Amen| contains this number.

          2. I will not, however, weary thee by recounting their other
          interpretations, that you may perceive the results everywhere. They
          maintain for instance, that the letter Eta (e) along with the Episemon
          (s) constitutes an Ogdoad, inasmuch as it occupies the eighth place
          from the first letter. Then, again, without the Episemon, reckoning
          the number of the letters, and adding them up till we come to Eta,
          they bring out the Triacontad. For if one begins at Alpha and ends
          with Eta, omitting the Episemon, and adds together the value of the
          letters in succession, he will find their number altogether to amount
          to thirty. For up to Epsilon (e) fifteen are formed; then adding seven
          to that number, the sum of twenty-two is reached. Next, Eta being
          added to these, since its value is eight, the most wonderful
          Triacontad is completed. And hence they give forth that the Ogdoad is
          the mother of the thirty Æons. Since, therefore, the number thirty is
          composed of three powers [the Ogdoad, Decad, and Duodecad], when
          multiplied by three, it produces ninety, for three times thirty are
          ninety. Likewise this Triad, when multiplied by itself, gives rise to
          nine. Thus the Ogdoad generates, by these means, ninety-nine. And
          since the twelfth Æon, by her defection, left eleven in the heights
          above, they maintain that therefore the position of the letters is a
          true coordinate of the method of their calculation (for Lambda is the
          eleventh in order among the letters, and represents the number
          thirty), and also forms a representation of the arrangement of affairs
          above, since, on from Alpha, omitting Episemon, the number of the
          letters up to Lambda, when added together according to the successive
          value of the letters, and including Lambda itself, forms the sum of
          ninety-nine; but that this Lambda, being the eleventh in order,
          descended to seek after one equal to itself, so as to complete the
          number of twelve letters, and when it found such a one, the number was
          completed, is manifest from the very configuration of the letter; for
          Lambda being engaged, as it were, in the quest of one similar to
          itself, and finding such an one, and clasping it to itself, thus
          filled up the place of the twelfth, the letter Mu (M) being composed
          of two Lambdas (LL). Wherefore also they, by means of their
          |knowledge,| avoid the place of ninety-nine, that is, the defection --
          a type of the left hand, -- but endeavour to secure one more, which,
          when added to the ninety and nine, has the effect of changing their
          reckoning to the right hand.

          3. I well know, my dear friend, that when thou hast read through all
          this, thou wilt indulge in a hearty laugh over this their inflated
          wise folly! But those men are really worthy of being mourned over, who
          promulgate such a kind of religion, and who so frigidly and perversely
          pull to pieces the greatness of the truly unspeakable power, and the
          dispensations of God in themselves so striking, by means of Alpha and
          Beta, and through the aid of numbers. But as many as separate from the
          Church, and give heed to such old wives' fables as these, are truly
          self-condemned; and these men Paul commands us, |after a first and
          second admonition, to avoid.| And John, the disciple of the Lord, has
          intensified their condemnation, when he desires us not even to address
          to them the salutation of |good-speed;| for, says he, |He that bids
          them be of good-speed is a partaker with their evil deeds;| and that
          with reason, |for there is no good-speed to the ungodly,| saith the
          Lord. Impious indeed, beyond all impiety, are these men, who assert
          that the Maker of heaven and earth, the only God Almighty, besides
          whom there is no God, was produced by means of a defect, which itself
          sprang from another defect, so that, according to them, He was the
          product of the third defect. Such an opinion we should detest and
          execrate, while we ought everywhere to flee far apart from those that
          hold it; and in proportion as they vehemently maintain and rejoice in
          their fictitious doctrines, so much the more should we be convinced
          that they are under the influence of the wicked spirits of the Ogdoad,
          -- just as those persons who fall into a fit of frenzy, the more they
          laugh, and imagine themselves to be well, and do all things as if they
          were in good health [both of body and mind], yea, some things better
          than those who really are so, are only thus shown to be the more
          seriously diseased. In like manner do these men, the more they seem to
          excel others in wisdom, and waste their strength by drawing the bow
          too tightly, the greater fools do they show themselves. For when the
          unclean spirit of folly has gone forth, and when afterwards he finds
          them not waiting upon God, but occupied with mere worldly questions,
          then, |taking seven other spirits more wicked than himself,| and
          inflating the minds of these men with the notion of their being able
          to conceive of something beyond God, and having fitly prepared them
          for the reception of deceit, he implants within them the Ogdoad of the
          foolish spirits of wickedness.<br />
