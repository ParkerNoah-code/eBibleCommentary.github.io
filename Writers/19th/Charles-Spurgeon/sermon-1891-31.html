          1. Besides those, however, among these heretics who are Simonians, and
          of whom we have already spoken, a multitude of Gnostics have sprung
          up, and have been manifested like mushrooms growing out of the ground.
          I now proceed to describe the principal opinions held by them. Some of
          them, then, set forth a certain Æon who never grows old, and exists in
          a virgin spirit: him they style Barbelos. They declare that somewhere
          or other there exists a certain father who cannot be named, and that
          he was desirous to reveal himself to this Barbelos. Then this Ennoea
          went forward, stood before his face, and demanded from him Prognosis
          (prescience). But when Prognosis had, [as was requested,] come forth,
          these two asked for Aphtharsia (incorruption), which also came forth,
          and after that Zoe Aionios (eternal life). Barbelos, glorying in
          these, and contemplating their greatness, and in conception [thus
          formed], rejoicing in this greatness, generated light similar to it.
          They declare that this was the beginning both of light and of the
          generation of all things; and that the Father, beholding this light,
          anointed it with his own benignity, that it might be rendered perfect.
          Moreover, they maintain that this was Christ, who again, according to
          them, requested that Nous should be given him as an assistant; and
          Nous came forth accordingly. Besides these, the Father sent forth
          Logos. The conjunctions of Ennoea and Logos, and of Aphtharsia and
          Christ, will thus be formed; while Zoe Aionios was united to Thelema,
          and Nous to Prognosis. These, then, magnified the great light and
          Barbelos.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They also affirm that Autogenes was afterwards sent forth from
          Ennoea and Logos, to be a representation of the great light, and that
          he was greatly honoured, all things being rendered subject unto him.
          Along with him was sent forth Aletheia, and a conjunction was formed
          between Autogenes and Aletheia. But they declare that from the Light,
          which is Christ, and from Aphtharsia, four luminaries were sent forth
          to surround Autogenes; and again from Thelema and Zoe Aionios four
          other emissions took place, to wait upon these four luminaries; and
          these they name Charis (grace), Thelesis (will), Synesis
          (understanding), and Phronesis (prudence). Of these, Charis is
          connected with the great and first luminary: him they represent as
          Soter (Saviour), and style Armogenes. Thelesis, again, is united to
          the second luminary, whom they also name Raguel; Synesis to the third,
          whom they call David; and Phronesis to the fourth, whom they name
          Eleleth.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. All these, then, being thus settled, Autogenes moreover produces a
          perfect and true man, whom they also call Adamas, inasmuch as neither
          has he himself ever been conquered, nor have those from whom he
          sprang; he also was, along with the first light, severed from
          Armogenes. Moreover, perfect knowledge was sent forth by Autogenes
          along with man, and was united to him; hence he attained to the
          knowledge of him that is above all. Invincible power was also
          conferred on him by the virgin spirit; and all things then rested in
          him, to sing praises to the great Æon. Hence also they declare were
          manifested the mother, the father, the son; while from Anthropos and
          Gnosis that Tree was produced which they also style Gnosis itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Next they maintain, that from the first angel, who stands by the
          side of Monogenes, the Holy Spirit has been sent forth, whom they also
          term Sophia and Prunicus. He then, perceiving that all the others had
          consorts, while he himself was destitute of one, searched after a
          being to whom he might be united; and not finding one, he exerted and
          extended himself to the uttermost and looked down into the lower
          regions, in the expectation of there finding a consort; and still not
          meeting with one, he leaped forth [from his place] in a state of great
          impatience, [which had come upon him] because he had made his attempt
          without the good-will of his father. Afterwards, under the influence
          of simplicity and kindness, he produced a work in which were to be
          found ignorance and audacity. This work of his they declare to be
          Protarchontes, the former of this [lower] creation. But they relate
          that a mighty power carried him away from his mother, and that he
          settled far away from her in the lower regions, and formed the
          firmament of heaven, in which also they affirm that he dwells. And in
          his ignorance he formed those powers which are inferior to himself --
          angels, and firmaments, and all things earthly. They affirm that he,
          being united to Authadia (audacity), produced Kakia (wickedness),
          Zelos (emulation), Phthonos (envy), Erinnys (fury), and Epithymia
          (lust). When these were generated, the mother Sophia deeply grieved,
          fled away, departed into the upper regions, and became the last of the
          Ogdoad, reckoning it downwards. On her thus departing, he imagined he
          was the only being in existence; and on this account declared, |I am a
          jealous God, and besides me there is no one.| Such are the falsehoods
          which these people invent.<br />
