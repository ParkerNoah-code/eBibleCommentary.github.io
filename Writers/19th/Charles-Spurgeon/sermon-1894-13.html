        <p>THE UTTER DESTRUCTION AND THE GREAT RESTORATION</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>
          Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth
          hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come
          forth of it. For the LORD hath indignation against all the nations,
          and fury against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
          hath delivered them to the slaughter. Their slain also shall be cast
          out, and the stink of their carcases shall come up, and the mountains
          shall be melted with their blood. And all the host of heaven shall be
          dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and
          all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine,
          and as a fading leaf from the fig tree. For my sword hath drunk its
          fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the
          people of my curse, to judgement. The sword of the LORD is filled with
          blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats,
          with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
          Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. And the wild-oxen
          shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their
          land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with
          fatness. For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance, the year of
          recompence in the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall
          be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the
          land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched
          night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation
          to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever
          and ever. But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the
          owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he shall stretch over it
          the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness. They shall call
          the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all
          her princes shall be nothing. And thorns shall come up in her palaces,
          nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an
          habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches. And the wild beasts of
          the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the satyr shall cry to his
          fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her
          a place of rest. There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay,
          and hatch, and gather under her shadow: yea, there shall the kites be
          gathered, every one with her mate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read:<br />No one of these
          shall be missing,<br />None shall want her mate:<br />For my mouth it
          hath commanded,<br />And his spirit it hath gathered them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto
          them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to
          generation shall they dwell therein.
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad; and the desert
          shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly,
          and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be
          given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the
          glory of the LORD, the excellency of our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strengthen ye the weak hands,<br />And confirm the feeble knees;<br />Say
          to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: Behold, your
          God will come with vengeance,<br />With the recompence of God he will
          come and save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
          shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the
          tongue of the dumb shall sing: for in the wilderness shall waters
          break out, and streams in the desert. And the glowing sand shall
          become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the
          habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and
          rushes. And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
          called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it
          shall be for those: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err
          therein. No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up
          thereon, they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk
          there: and the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come with
          singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they
          shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
