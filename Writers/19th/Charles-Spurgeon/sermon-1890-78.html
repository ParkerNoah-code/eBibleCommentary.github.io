          1. The preceding Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents were inserted
          in vol.20 of the Edinburgh series, quite out of place as it seems to
          me; and the more so, as other Syriac fragments were to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In vol.22, equally out of place, and mixed up with incongruous
          material, followed the very interesting work of Bardesanes, to which I
          now assign a natural collocation with the Edessene Memoirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In vol.24, with the Liturgies and other mixed material, comes the
          third Syriac fagot, another valuable and very interesting contribution
          severed from its due connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reader of this volume will rejoice to find Mr. Pratten's scattered
          but most instructive translations here brought together, and arranged
          in less confused sequence and relations one with another. The several
          announcements prefixed to each have, in like manner, been here
          gathered and set in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be worth while, just here, to direct attention to the latest
          views of scholarship upon Syria, its language and its antiquities. A
          learned critic, who often supplies one of our weekly newspapers with
          articles on the Oriental languages worthy of the best reviews, has
          directed attention to a searching critique of Mommsen's recent
          addition to his Roman History, of a chapter which |deals with
          Bible-lands in New-Testament times.| Professor Nöldke of Strasburg, a
          leading Semitic scholar, in the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental
          Society, thus takes him to task: --
        </p>
        <p>
          |Syria enjoyed a higher prosperity under the Romans than Mommsen
          concedes, and this continued down into the Christian period. The
          Hellenization made rapid strides, but not in such a manner that the
          Greek language or Greek culture spread to a considerable degree; but
          rather, in such a way that European arts and manners of life were
          established, and that a number of elements of Occidental culture
          became powerful in the thinking and language of the educated. Mommsen,
          according to my conviction, considers the Hellenization of Syria to
          have advanced much farther than it actually had. That the language of
          the country had been entirely banished from the circles of the
          educated, and that it had assumed the position in reference to the
          Greek which the Celtic in full had assumed over against the Latin, is
          certainly an exaggerated view. The Aramaic was an old developed
          language (Cultursprache), which was already written before a single
          letter was seen in Latium. In the days of the Achæmenidian rulers this
          was the official language of Egypt, and even of Asia Minor, and was
          accordingly spread far beyond the original territory. Again we find
          this language in the days of the Roman emperors not only in Palmyra,
          but spread also in the whole country of the Nabatheans, and down to
          almost Medina; here again beyond its native limits, as the official
          written language. And that this was not merely a remnant of the former
          political supremacy is evident from the fact that the documents of
          Palmyra and those of the Nabatheans, in an equal manner, show a
          younger stage of development of language than that of the Achæmenidian
          period; this stage being virtually the same as is seen in the various
          Jewish literary works of that time.|
        </p>
        <p>
          As Mommsen is continuing his irreligious elaborations of history, it
          may be well to bear in mind his superficial ideas on such subjects,
          especially when he is reaching the affairs of early Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Our translator (Mr. Pratten) makes the following announcements: --
        </p>
        <p>
          |The translation of the Syriac pieces which follow is based on a
          careful examination of that made by Dr. Cureton, the merits of which
          are cordially acknowledged. It will, however, be seen that it differs
          from that in many and important particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Many thanks are due to the Dean of Canterbury for his kindness in
          giving much valuable help.|
        </p>
        <p>2. He thus introduces the treatise of Bardesanes: --</p>
        <p>
          |Bardesan, or Bardesanes, according to one account, was born at Edessa
          in 154 a.d., and it is supposed that he died sometime between 224 and
          230. Eusebius says that he flourished in the time of Marcus Aurelius.
          He was for some time resident at the court of Abgar VI., King of
          Edessa, with whom he was on intimate terms. He at first belonged to
          the Gnostic sect of the Valentinians; but abandoning it, he seemed to
          come nearer the orthodox beliefs. In reality, it is said, he devised
          errours of his own. He wrote many works. Eusebius attributes the work
          now translated, The Book of Laws, or On Fate, to Bardesanes. Many
          modern critics have come to the conclusion that it was written by a
          scholar of Bardesanes, but that it gives us the genuine opinions and
          reasonings of Bardesanes. The question is of interest in connection
          with the Clementine Recognitions, which contain a large portion of the
          work. The Syriac was first published by Cureton in his Spicilegium.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In introducing the Mara bar Serapion and the Ambrose, he thus
          refers to his friend Dr. Payne Smith: --
        </p>
        <p>
          The text of the two following short pieces is found in the Spicilegium
          Syriacum of the late Dr. Cureton. This careful scholar speaks of the
          second of these compositions as containing |some very obscure
          passages.| The same remark holds good also of the first. Dr. Payne
          Smith describes them both as |full of difficulties.| So far as these
          arise from errors in the text, they might have been removed, had I
          been able to avail myself of the opportunity kindly offered me by Dr.
          Rieu, Keeper of the Oriental mss. at the British Museum, of inspecting
          the original ms. As it is, several have, it is hoped, been
          successfully met by conjecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Dr. R. Payne Smith, Dean of Canterbury, who, as on two previous
          occasions, has most kindly and patiently afforded me his valuable
          assistance, I beg to offer my very grateful acknowledgments.
