        <h2>FRUITLESS FAITH</h2>
        <p>
          “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.” - James
          2:17
        </p>
        <p>
          WHATEVER the statement of James may be, it could never have been his
          intention to contradict the Gospel. It could never be possible that
          the Holy Spirit would say one thing, in one place, and another in
          another. Statements of Paul and of James must be reconciled, and if
          they were not, I would be prepared sooner to throw overboard the
          statement of James than that of Paul. Luther did so, I think, most
          unjustifiably. If you ask me, then, how I dare to say I would sooner
          do so, my reply is, I said I would sooner throw over James than Paul
          for this reason, because, at any rate, we must keep to the Master
          Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ought never to raise any questions about differences of
          inspiration, since they are all equally inspired, but if such
          questions could be raised and were allowable, it were wisdom to stick
          fastest to those who cling closest to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the last words of the Lord Jesus, before He was taken up were
          these, “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every
          creature,” and what was this Gospel? “He that believeth and is
          baptized shall be saved.” To that, then, we must always cling, but
          Jesus Christ has given a promise of salvation to the baptized
          believer, and He has said, “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the
          wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, and whosoever
          believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.” Here it
          is clear He promises everlasting life to all who believe in Him, to
          all who trust in Him. Now from the Master’s words we will not stir,
          but close to His own declaration we will stand. Be assured that the
          Gospel of your salvation as a believer, with a simple confidence in
          Jesus Christ, whom God raised from the dead, will save your soul, a
          simple and undiluted reliance upon the life and death, and
          resurrection, and merit, and person of Jesus Christ, will ensure to
          you everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let nothing move you from this confidence, it has great recompense of
          reward. Heaven and earth may pass away, but from this grand
          fundamental truth not one jot or tittle shall ever be moved. “He that
          believeth in him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is
          condemned already, because he hath not believed on the Son of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact is, James and Paul are perfectly reconcilable, and they are
          just viewing truth from different standpoints, but whatever James may
          mean, I am quite confident about what Paul means, and confident about
          the truth of the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second remark. James never intended, for a moment, nor do any of his
          words lead us into such a belief, that there can be any merit whatever
          in any good works of ours. After we have done all, if we could do all,
          we would only have done what we were bound to do. Surely there is no
          merit in a man’s paying what he owes, no great merit in a servant who
          has his wages for doing what he is paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of merit between the creature and his Creator is not to
          be raised, He has a right to us, He has the right of creation, the
          right of preservation, the right of infinite sovereignty, and whatever
          He should exact of us, we should require nothing from Him in return,
          and having sinned as we have all, for us to talk of salvation by
          merit, by our own works, is worse than vanity, it is an impertinence
          which God will never endure.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Talk they of morals, O! Thou bleeding Lamb,<br />
          The best morality is love of Thee.”
        </p>
        <p>Talk of salvation by works, and Cowper’s reply seems apt—</p>
        <p>
          “Perish the virtue, as it ought, abhorred,<br />
          And the fool with it, who insults his Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          What James does mean, however, is this, no doubt, in brief and short,
          that while faith saves, it is faith of a certain kind. No man is saved
          by persuading himself that he is saved, nobody is saved by believing
          Jesus Christ died for him. That may be, or may not be, true in the
          sense in which he understands it. In a certain sense Christ died for
          all men, but since it is evident that many men are lost, Christ’s
          dying for all men is not at all a ground upon which any man may hope
          to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ died for some men in another sense, in a peculiar and special
          sense. No man has a right to believe that Christ peculiarly and
          specially died for him until he has an evidence of it in casting
          himself upon Christ, and trusting in Jesus, and bringing forth
          suitable works to evince the reality of his faith. The faith that
          saves is not a historical faith, not a faith that simply believes a
          creed and certain facts, I have no doubt devils are very orthodox, I
          do not know which church they belong to, though there are some in all
          churches, there was one in Christ’s church when He was on earth, for
          He said one was filled with devils, and there are some in all
          churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devils believe all the facts of revelation. I do not believe they have
          a doubt, they have suffered too much from the hand of God to doubt His
          existence! They have felt too much the terror of His wrath to doubt
          the righteousness of His government. They are stern believers, but
          they are not saved, and such a faith, if it be in us, will not, cannot
          save us, but will remain to all intents and purposes a dead,
          inoperative faith. It is a faith which produces works which saves us,
          the works do not save us, but a faith which does not produce works is
          a faith that will only deceive, and cannot lead us into heaven. Now
          this evening we shall first speak a few words upon—
        </p>
        <h2>
          I. WHAT KIND OF WORKS THEY ARE WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO PROVE OUR FAITH
          IF IT BE A SAVING FAITH.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The works which are absolutely necessary are, in brief, these, first,
          there must be fruits meet for repentance, works of repentance. It is
          wrong to tell a man he must repent before he may trust Christ, but it
          is right to tell him that, having trusted Christ, it is not possible
          for him to remain impenitent. There never was in this world such a
          thing as an impenitent believer in Jesus Christ, and there never can
          be. Faith and repentance are born in a spiritual life together, and
          they grow up together. The moment a man believes, he repents, and
          while he believes he both believes and repents, and until he shall
          have done with faith he will not have done with repenting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have believed, but have never repented of your sins, then
          beware of your believing. If you pretend now to be a child of God, and
          if you have never clothed yourself in dust and ashes, if you have
          never hated the sins which once you did love, if you do not now hate
          them, and endeavor to be rid of them, if you do not humble yourself
          before God on account of them, as the Lord lives, you know nothing
          about saving faith, for faith puts a distance between us and sin, in a
          moment it leads us away from the distance between us and Christ,
          nearer to Christ, we are now far off from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he that loves his sin, thinks little of his sin, goes into it with
          levity, talks of it sportively, speaks of sin as though it were a
          trifle, has the faith of devils, but the faith of God’s elect he never
          knew. True faith purges the soul, since the man now hunts after sin
          that he might find out the traitor that lurks within his nature, and
          though a believer is not perfect, yet the drift of faith is to make
          him perfect, and if it is faith to be perfected, the believer shall be
          perfected, and then he shall be caught up to dwell before the throne.
          Judge yourselves, my hearers. Have you brought forth the fruits of
          repentance? If not, your faith without them is dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Works of secret piety are also essential to true faith. Does a man
          say, I believe that Jesus died for me, and I hope to be saved, and
          does he live in a constant neglect of private prayer? Is the Word of
          God never read? Does he never lift up his eye in secret with, “My
          Father be thou the guide of my youth”? Has he no secret regard in his
          heart to the Lord his God, and does he hold no communion with Christ
          his Savior, and is there no fellowship with the Holy Spirit?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then how can faith dwell in such a man? As well say that a man is
          alive when he does not breathe, and in whom the blood does not
          circulate, as to say that a man is a believer with living faith who
          does not draw near to God in prayer, that does not live indeed under
          the awe and fear of the Most High God as ever present, and seeing Him
          in all places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge yourselves, you professors. Are you neglecting prayer, have you
          no secret spiritual life? If so, away with your notion about saving
          faith. You are not justified by such a faith as that, there is no life
          in it, it is not a faith that leads to the Lamb and brings salvation,
          if it were, it would show itself by driving you to your knees, and
          making you lift up your heart to the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another set of works are those which I may call works of obedience.
          When a man trusts in Jesus, he accepts Jesus as his Master. He says,
          “Show me what thou wouldst have me to do.” The Father shows what
          Christ would have Him to do. He does not set up His own will and
          judgment, but He is obedient to His Master’s will. I will not tonight
          speak of those who know not their Lord’s will, who shall be beaten
          with few stripes, but I do fear there are some professors who are
          living in willful neglect of known Christian duties, and yet suppose
          themselves to be the partakers of saving faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a duty may be neglected, and yet a man may be saved, but a duty
          persistently and willfully neglected, may be the leak that will sink
          the ship, or the neglect of any one of such duties for the surrender
          of a true heart to Christ does not go such and such a length and then
          stop. Christ will save no heart upon terms and conditions, it must be
          an unconditional surrender to His government if you would be saved by
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now some will draw a line here, and some will draw a line there up to
          this, and say, “I will be Christ’s servant,” that is to say, sir, you
          will be your own master, for that is the English of it, but the true
          heart that has really believed says, “I will make haste, and delay not
          to keep thy commandments; make straight the path before my feet, for
          thy commandments are not grievous.” “I have delighted in thy
          commandments more than in fine gold.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, sons and daughters of sin, professedly, what say you to this?
          Have you an eye to the Master, as servants keep their eye to their
          mistress? Do you ever ask yourselves what would Christ have you to do?
          or do you live habitually in the neglect of Christ’s law and will? Do
          you go to places where Christ would not meet you, and where you would
          not like to meet with Him? Are some of you in the habit of professing
          maxims and customs, upon which you know your Lord would never set His
          seal? You say you believe, you have faith in Him? Ah! sirs, if it be a
          living faith, it will be an obedient faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living faith produces what I shall call separating works. When a man
          believes in Jesus, he is not what he was, nor will he consort with
          those who were once his familiars. Our Lord has said, “Ye are not of
          the world, even as I am not of the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Christ was not an ascetic, He ate and drank as other men do so
          that they even said of Him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, because
          He mingled with the rest of mankind, but was there ever a more
          unearthly life than the life of Christ? He seems to go through all the
          world a complete man in all that is necessary to manliness, but His
          presence is like the presence of a seraph among sinners. You can
          discover at once that He is not of their mold, nor of their spirit,
          only harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now such will the believer be if his faith be genuine, but this is a
          sharp cut to some professors, but not a whit more sharp than the
          Scripture warrants. If we are of the world, what can we expect but the
          world’s doom in the day of the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ? If
          you find your pleasure with the world, you shall meet your
          condemnation with the world, if with the world you live, with the
          world you shall die, and with the world you shall live again forever,
          lost. Where there is no separation there is no grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are conformed to this world, how dare we talk about grace being
          in our souls, and if there be no distinguishing difference between us
          and worldlings, what vanity it is, what trifling, what hypocrisy, what
          a delusion for us to come to the Lord’s table, talking about being the
          Lord’s sons, when we are none of His! Faith without the works which
          denote the difference between a believer and a worldling is a dead,
          un-saving faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I have not said that any believer is perfect. I have never thought
          so, but I have said that if a believer could be a believer altogether,
          and faith could have her perfect work, he would be perfect, and that
          in proportion as he is truly a believer, in that proportion he will
          bring forth fruit that shall magnify God and prove the sincerity of
          his faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other set of works will be necessary to prove the vitality of his
          faith, namely, works of love. He that loves Christ feels that the love
          of Christ constrains him, he endeavors to spread abroad the knowledge
          of Christ, he longs to win jewels for Christ’s crown, he endeavors to
          extend the boundaries of Christ’s and Messiah’s kingdom, and I will
          not give a farthing for the loftiest profession coupled with the most
          flowing words, that never shows itself in direct deeds of Christian
          service. If you love Christ, you cannot help serving Him. If you
          believe in Him, there is such potency in what you believe, such power
          in the grace which comes with believing, that you must serve Christ,
          and if you serve Him not, you are not His.
        </p>
        <p>
          This proof, before we leave it, might be illustrated in various ways.
          We will just give one. A tree has been planted out into the ground.
          Now the source of life to that tree is at the root, whether it has
          apples on it or not, the apples would not give it life, but the whole
          of the life of the tree will come from its root. But if that tree
          stands in the orchard, and when the spring time comes there is no bud,
          and when the summer comes there is no leafing, and no fruit-bearing,
          but the next year, and the next, it stands there without bud or
          blossom, or leaf or fruit, you would say it is dead, and you are
          correct, it is dead. It is not that the leaves could have made it
          live, but that the absence of the leaves is a proof that it is dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, is it with the professor. If he has life, that life must give
          fruits, if not fruits, works, if his faith has a root, but if there be
          no works, then depend upon it the inference that he is spiritually
          dead is certainly a correct one. When the telegraph cable flashed no
          message across to America, when they tried to telegraph again and
          again, but the only result following was dead earth, they felt
          persuaded that there was a fracture, and well they might, and when
          there is nothing produced in the life by the supposed grace which we
          have, and nothing is telegraphed to the world but “dead earth,” we may
          rest assured that the link of connection between the soul and Christ
          does not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not enlarge. We should just put it into that one sentence,
          “Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Bring forth, therefore,
          works meet for repentance.” And now we turn to the second point with
          more brevity—
        </p>
        <h2>
          II. SOME FACTS THAT BACK UP THE DOCTRINE THAT “FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS
          DEAD.”
        </h2>
        <p>
          These facts show that it is evident to all observers that many
          professors of faith without works are not saved. It would be very
          ludicrous, if it were not very miserable, to think of some who wrap
          themselves in the conceit that they are saved about whose salvation
          nobody but themselves can have any question.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember a professor who used to talk of being justified by faith
          who was most assured about it, when he contained much beer. Such
          professors are not at all uncommon, sad is it to say so. They seem at
          the moment, when their condemnation seems written on their very brow
          to all who know them, to be most confident that they themselves are
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brethren, if such cases are convincing and you entertain no
          doubt, but decide in their case, apply the same rule to yourselves,
          for although you may not plunge into the grosser vices, yet if you
          make your homes wretched by your selfishness, if you fall into
          constant habits of vicious temper, if you never strive against these
          sins, and the grace of God never leads you out of them, if you can
          live in private sin, and yet pacify your conscience, and remain just
          as you were before your pretended conversion, when you sit in judgment
          and pronounce the verdict on others, feel that you pronounce it upon
          yourself, for surely for one sin that is openly indulged in, which is
          manifested to you in the dissipation of your fellow creatures, it is
          not hard for you to believe that any other sin, if it be constantly
          indulged and be loved, will do the same to you as it does to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know men who have not faith, but have a sort of faith, are not
          saved. It must be true, or else where were the Savior’s words,
          “Straight is the gate and narrow the way, and few there be that find
          it”? For this is no straight gate and no narrow way, merely to be
          orthodox and hold a creed, and say, “I believe Jesus died for me,” but
          it is a very narrow gate so to believe as to become practically
          Christ’s servants, so to trust as to give up that which Christ hates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truths which Jesus bids us believe are all truths, which, if believed,
          must have an effect upon the daily life. A man cannot really believe
          that Jesus Christ has taken away his sin by such sufferings as those
          of the cross, and yet trifle with sin. A man is a liar who says, “I
          believe that yonder bleeding Savior suffered on account of my sins,”
          and yet holds good fellowship with the very sins that put Christ to
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! sirs, a faith in the bleeding Savior is a faith that craves for
          vengeance upon every form of sin. The Christian religion makes us
          believe that we are the sons of God when we trust in Christ. Will a
          man believe that he is really the son of God, and then daily and
          willfully go and live like a child of the devil? Do you expect to see
          members of the royal court playing with beggars in the street? When a
          man believes himself to possess a certain station of life, that belief
          leads him to a certain carriage and conversation, and when I am led to
          believe I am elected of God, that I am redeemed by blood, that heaven
          is secured to me by the covenant of grace, that I am God’s priest,
          made a king in Christ Jesus, I cannot, if I believe, unless I am more
          monstrous than human nature itself seems capable of being, go back to
          live after just the same fashion, to run in the same course as others,
          and live as the sons of Belial live.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see constantly in Scripture, and all the saints affirm it, that
          faith is linked with grace, and that where faith is the grace of God
          is, but how can there be the gift of God reigning in the soul, and yet
          a love of sin and a neglect of holiness? I cannot understand grace
          reigning and vice ruling over the living and incorruptible seed which
          abides forever in the inner man, and for this man to give himself up
          to be a slave of Satan is a thing impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, again, is always in connection with regeneration. Now
          regeneration is making of the old thing new, it is infusing a new
          nature into a man. The new birth is not a mere reformation, but an
          entire renovation and revolution, it is making the man a new creation
          in Christ Jesus. But a new creature, if he has no repentance, if he
          has no good works, no private prayer, no charity, no holiness of any
          kind, regeneration will be a football for scorn. The new birth would
          be a thing to be ridiculed, if it did not really produce a hatred of
          sin, and a love of holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          That kind of new birth which is dispensed by the Church of Rome, and
          also by some in the Church of England, is a kind of new birth which
          ought to excite the derision of all mankind, for children are said to
          be born again, certified to be born again, made members of Christ and
          children of God, and afterwards they grow up, in many cases, in most
          cases, let me say, to forget their baptismal vows, and live in sin as
          others do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidently it has had no effect upon them, but regeneration such as we
          read of in the Bible changes the nature of man, makes him hate the
          things he loved, and love the things he hated. This is regeneration,
          this is regeneration which is worth the seeking, it always comes with
          faith, and consequently good works must go with faith too.
        </p>
        <p>But we pass on to the last matter, which is this—</p>
        <h2>
          III. WHAT OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE FAITH, AND THAT HAVE NO GOOD WORKS?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Then what about them? Why, this about them, that their supposed faith
          generally makes them very careless and indifferent, and ultimately
          hardened and depraved men. I dread beyond measure that any one of us
          should have a name to live when we are dead, for an ordinary sinner
          who makes no profession may be converted, but it is extremely rare
          that a sinner who makes a profession of being what he is not is ever
          converted. It is a miserable thing to find a person discovering that
          his profession has been a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man sits down and he says, “Why, I believe,” and as he walks he is
          careful, because he is afraid of what others might say. By and by, he
          begins to indulge a little. He says, “This is not of works, I may do
          this, and yet get forgiveness.” Then he goes a little further away. I
          do not say that perhaps at first he goes to the theater, but he goes
          next door to it. He does not get drunk, but he likes jovial company.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little further and he gets confirmed in the belief that he is a
          saved one, and he gets so much confirmed in that idea that he thinks
          he can do just as he likes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having sported on the brink without falling over, he thinks he will
          try again, and he goes a little further and further, until I may
          venture to say, if Satan needs raw material of which to make the worst
          of men, he generally takes those who profess to be the best, and I
          have questioned whether such a valuable servant of Satan as Judas was
          could ever have been made of any other material than an apostate
          apostle. If he had not lived near to Christ, he never could have
          become such a traitor as he was. You must have a good knowledge of
          religion to be a thorough-faced hypocrite, and you must become high in
          Christ’s church before you can become fit tools for Satan’s worst
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! but why do men do this? Oh! what is the use of maintaining such a
          faith? I think if we do not care to get the vitality of religion, I
          would never burden myself with the husks of it, for such people get
          the chains of godliness without getting the comforts of godliness.
          They dare not do this, they dare not do that, if they do they feel
          hampered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why don’t they give up professing? and they would be at least be free,
          they would have the sin without the millstone about their neck. Surely
          there can be no excuse for men who mean to perish coming to cover
          themselves with a mask of godliness! Why cannot they perish as they
          are? Why add sin to sin by insulting the church through the cross of
          Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          When men make a profession of religion, and yet their works do not
          follow their faith, what about them? Why, this about them. They have
          dishonored the church, and of all others, these are the people that
          make the world point to the church and say, “Where is your religion?
          That is your religion, is it?” So it is when they find a man who
          professes to be in Christ, and yet walks not as Christ walked.
        </p>
        <p>
          These give the church her wounds, she receives them in the house of
          her friends, these make the true ministers of God go to their closets
          with broken heart, crying out, “Oh! Lord, wherefore hast thou sent us
          to this people to speak and minister amongst them, that they should
          play the hypocrite before thee?” These are they that prevent the
          coming in of others, for others take knowledge of them, as they think
          religion is hypocrisy, and they are hindered, and if not seriously,
          they get, at any rate, comfort in their sin from the iniquity of these
          professors.
        </p>
        <p>
          What their judgment will be when Christ appears, it is not for my
          tongue to tell, in that day when, with tongue of fire, Christ shall
          search every heart, and call on all men to receive their judgment,
          what must be the lot of the base born professor, who prostituted his
          profession to his own honor and gain? He sought not the glory of God.
          What shall be the thunder bolt that shall pursue his guilty soul in
          its timorous flight to hell, and what the chains that are reserved in
          blackness and darkness forever for those who are wells without water
          and clouds without rain?
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell, and may God grant that you may never know. Oh! may we
          all tonight go to Christ Jesus, humbly and freely confessing our sins,
          and take Christ to be our complete Savior in very deed and truth. Then
          shall we be saved, and then, being saved, we shall seek to serve
          Christ with heart, and soul, and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lest I have missed my mark, this one illustration shall suffice, and I
          have done. There is a vessel drifting. She will soon be on the shore,
          but a pilot has come on board, he is standing on the deck, and he says
          to the captain and crew, “I promise and undertake that, if you will
          solely and alone trust me, I will save your vessel. Do you promise it,
          do you believe in me?” They believe in him, they say they believe the
          pilot can save the vessel, and they trust the vessel implicitly to his
          care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now listen to him. “Now,” says he, “you at that helm there!” He does
          not stir. “At the helm there! Can’t you hear?” He does not stir! He
          does not stir! “Well but, Jack, haven’t you confidence in the pilot?”
          “Oh! yes. Oh! yes, I have faith in him,” he says, “he will save the
          vessel if I have faith in him.” “Don’t you hear the pilot, as he says
          have faith in him, and you won’t touch the helm?” “Now, you aloft
          there! Reef that sail.” He does not stir, but lets the wind still blow
          into the sail and drift the vessel on to the coast “Now then, some of
          you, look alive, and reef that sail!” But he does not stir! “Why,
          captain, what shall I do? These fellows won’t stir or move a peg.” But
          “Oh,” says the captain, “I have every confidence in you, pilot. I
          believe you will save the vessel.” “Then why don’t you attend to the
          tiller, and all that?” “Oh! no,” says he, “I have great confidence in
          you. I don’t mean to do anything.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now when that ship goes down amid the boiling surges, and each man
          sinks to his doom, I will ask you, had they faith in the pilot? Hadn’t
          they a mimicing, mocking sort of faith, and only that? For if they had
          been really anxious to have the vessel rescued, and have trusted in
          the pilot, it would be the pilot who had saved them, and they could
          never have been saved without him. They would have proved their faith
          by their works. Their faith would have been made perfect, and the
          vessel would have been secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call upon every man here to do what Christ bids him. I call upon
          you, first of all, to prove that you believe in Christ by being
          baptized. “He that believeth in Christ and is baptized shall be
          saved.” The first proof that you believe in Christ is to be given by
          yielding to the much despised ordinance of believers’ baptism, and
          then, having done that, going on to the other means of which I have
          spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! I charge you by your soul’s salvation neglect nothing Christ
          commands, however trivial it may seem to your reason. Whatever He says
          to you, do it, for only by a childlike obedience to every bidding of
          Christ can you expect to have the promise fulfilled, “They that trust
          in him shall be saved.” The Lord bless these words, for His name’s
          sake. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>EXPOSITION OF JAMES 2:14-26</h2>
        <p>
          <em
            >14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
            lust, and enticed.</em
          ><br />
          This is the wanton harlot that deceives the heart of man, his own
          desire grown strong and hot till it comes to be a lusting, this draws
          a man away, it baits the hook, and man swallows it and is thus
          entrapped and enticed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >15. Then when lust has conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
            when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</em
          ><br />
          There is the history and pedigree of sin. God save us from having any
          connection with the desire to sin, lest from that we be led into sin,
          and then from sin descend into death.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >16-17. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every
            perfect gift is from above,</em
          >—<br />
          All good from God, all evil from ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >17. And cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
            variableness, neither shadow of turning.</em
          ><br />
          There is variableness and there is the shadow of turning in the sun,
          but in that greater Father of lights there is neither parallax nor
          tropic, He is evermore the same, and we may go to Him with unwavering
          confidence because He is the same. Oh! what a blessing to such
          changing creatures as we are to have an unchanging God! “Of his own
          will.” If you want to know the power of God’s will, it never goes
          towards evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >18. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
            should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</em
          ><br />
          The best and noblest part of His creation, the twice begotten, the
          immortals that shall be the bodyguard of His Son, that shall stand
          about His bed, which is Solomon’s, each man with his sword upon his
          thigh, because of fear in the night. What a privilege it is to be
          begotten of God, to be the “firstfruits” of His creatures!
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >19. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
            hear,</em
          >—<br />
          Because it is by the Word that we are begotten, let us be swift to
          hear it. “Slow to speak,” because there is so much sin in us that the
          less we speak the better. In the multitude of words there wants not
          sin. Great talkativeness is seldom dissociated from great sinfulness.
          “Slow to wrath.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >19-20. Slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh
            not the righteousness of God.</em
          ><br />
          There is a tendency to grow angry with those who do not see the truth,
          but is it not a foolish thing to be angry with blind men because they
          do not see? What if you see yourself? Who opened your eyes? Give God
          the praise for what you see, and never think that your anger, your
          indignation, your hot temper, can ever work the righteousness of God.
          It is impossible, it is contrary thereto, and cannot work towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >21-23. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
            naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is
            able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word, and not
            hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of
            the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his
            natural face in a glass</em
          >:<br />
          It is a good thing for him to do that, to see himself as others see
          him. “Beholding his natural face,” even as men, in looking into the
          Word of God, behold the face of their nature, they see what they are
          like as they look into the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >24-26. For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
            forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the
            perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a
            forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed
            in his deed. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth
            not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is
            vain.</em
