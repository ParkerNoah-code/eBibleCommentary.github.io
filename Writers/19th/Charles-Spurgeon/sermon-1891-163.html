          1. As therefore the devil lied at the beginning, so did he also in the
          end, when he said, |All these are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever
          I will I give them.| For it is not he who has appointed the kingdoms
          of this world, but God; for |the heart of the king is in the hand of
          God.| And the Word also says by Solomon, |By me kings do reign, and
          princes administer justice. By me chiefs are raised up, and by me
          kings rule the earth.| Paul the apostle also says upon this same
          subject: |Be ye subject to all the higher powers; for there is no
          power but of God: now those which are have been ordained of God.| And
          again, in reference to them he says, |For he beareth not the sword in
          vain; for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath to him who
          does evil.| Now, that he spake these words, not in regard to angelical
          powers, nor of invisible rulers -- as some venture to expound the
          passage -- but of those of actual human authorities, [he shows when]
          he says, |For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
          ministers, doing service for this very thing.| This also the Lord
          confirmed, when He did not do what He was tempted to by the devil; but
          He gave directions that tribute should be paid to the tax-gatherers
          for Himself and Peter; because |they are the ministers of God, serving
          for this very thing.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For since man, by departing from God, reached such a pitch of fury
          as even to look upon his brother as his enemy, and engaged without
          fear in every kind of restless conduct, and murder, and avarice; God
          imposed upon mankind the fear of man, as they did not acknowledge the
          fear of God, in order that, being subjected to the authority of men,
          and kept under restraint by their laws, they might attain to some
          degree of justice, and exercise mutual forbearance through dread of
          the sword suspended full in their view, as the apostle says: |For he
          beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, the
          avenger for wrath upon him who does evil.| And for this reason too,
          magistrates themselves, having laws as a clothing of righteousness
          whenever they act in a just and legitimate manner, shall not be called
          in question for their conduct, nor be liable to punishment. But
          whatsoever they do to the subversion of justice, iniquitously, and
          impiously, and illegally, and tyrannically, in these things shall they
          also perish; for the just judgment of God comes equally upon all, and
          in no case is defective. Earthly rule, therefore, has been appointed
          by God for the benefit of nations, and not by the devil, who is never
          at rest at all, nay, who does not love to see even nations conducting
          themselves after a quiet manner, so that under the fear of human rule,
          men may not eat each other up like fishes; but that, by means of the
          establishment of laws, they may keep down an excess of wickedness
          among the nations. And considered from this point of view, those who
          exact tribute from us are |God's ministers, serving for this very
          purpose.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As, then, |the powers that be are ordained of God,| it is clear
          that the devil lied when he said, |These are delivered unto me; and to
          whomsoever I will, I give them.| For by the law of the same Being as
          calls men into existence are kings also appointed, adapted for those
          men who are at the time placed under their government. Some of these
          [rulers] are given for the correction and the benefit of their
          subjects, and for the preservation of justice; but others, for the
          purposes of fear and punishment and rebuke: others, as [the subjects]
          deserve it, are for deception, disgrace, and pride; while the just
          judgment of God, as I have observed already, passes equally upon all.
          The devil, however, as he is the apostate angel, can only go to this
          length, as he did at the beginning, [namely] to deceive and lead
          astray the mind of man into disobeying the commandments of God, and
          gradually to darken the hearts of those who would endeavour to serve
          him, to the forgetting of the true God, but to the adoration of
          himself as God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Just as if any one, being an apostate, and seizing in a hostile
          manner another man's territory, should harass the inhabitants of it,
          in order that he might claim for himself the glory of a king among
          those ignorant of his apostasy and robbery; so likewise also the
          devil, being one among those angels who are placed over the spirit of
          the air, as the Apostle Paul has declared in his Epistle to the
          Ephesians, becoming envious of man, was rendered an apostate from the
          divine law: for envy is a thing foreign to God. And as his apostasy
          was exposed by man, and man became the [means of] searching out his
          thoughts (et examinatio sententi√¶ ejus, homo factus est), he has set
          himself to this with greater and greater determination, in opposition
          to man, envying his life, and wishing to involve him in his own
          apostate power. The Word of God, however, the Maker of all things,
          conquering him by means of human nature, and showing him to be an
          apostate, has, on the contrary, put him under the power of man. For He
          says, |Behold, I confer upon you the power of treading upon serpents
          and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy,| in order that, as
          he obtained dominion over man by apostasy, so again his apostasy might
          be deprived of power by means of man turning back again to God.
