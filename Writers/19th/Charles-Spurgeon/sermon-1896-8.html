          14. Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people, and he will not
          forsake his inheritance.15. But judgment will return unto
          righteousness, and all the upright in heart after him.

          14 Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people He enforces the same
          truth which he had stated above in still clearer terms, denying it to
          be possible that God should cast off his people, whom he had chosen in
          a manner to be his inheritance. When assailed by afflictions, we
          should fly to this consideration, as a sanctuary of refuge, that we
          are God's people, gratuitously adopted into his family, and that he
          must necessarily have a most intimate and tender regard for our
          safety, having promised to watch as carefully over his Church as if it
          were his own heritage. We are thus again taught that our patience will
          soon give way and fail, unless the tumult of carnal suggestions be
          allayed by a knowledge of the Divine favor shining in upon our souls.

          15. But judgment will return unto righteousness In the dark season of
          affliction, it is not easy to recognize the secret love which God even
          then bears to his own children, and the Psalmist adduces another
          ground of comfort, in the consideration that God will eventually put
          an end to the confusions which perplex them, and reduce matters to
          order. The form of expression used by the Psalmist is a little
          obscure, and this has led some to read the first part of the verse, as
          if it contained two distinct clauses -- justice will return at the
          end, and then, judgment will return This is a violent wresting of the
          context. I have no doubt the Psalmist meant to say that judgment would
          be fitted or conformed to justice. And by judgment here is meant, as
          in many other places, the government or public state of matters. The
          confusion which prevails in the world, seems to argue some defect or
          unrighteousness of administration; and he holds out to us that it
          shall be well in the issue. More is said than merely that men who
          indulged in reckless oppression would be brought back to equitable
          dealing. A deeper meaning is intended, That God, when he interposed to
          restore the condition of his people, would bring forth openly to the
          light his justice which had lain concealed; by which we are not to
          understand that he ever deviates the least in his providence from the
          strictest rectitude, only there is not always that harmony and
          arrangement which might make his righteousness apparent to man's view,
          and the correction of this inequality is here called justice of
          government. As the sun's light is hid from view at night, or at a
          cloudy season, so when the wicked persecute the righteous, and are
          allowed to indulge in iniquity without restraint, the Divine justice
          is obscured by the clouds which are thus interposed between us and the
          providence of God, and judgment is in a manner separated from justice.
          But when things are brought back again to their proper state, justice
          and government are seen to harmonize perfectly together in the
          equality which prevails. Faith no doubt, should enable us to discern
          the justice of God even when things are most dark and disordered; but
          the passage speaks of what would be obvious to sense and actual
          observation, and asserts that the justice of God would shine as the
          sky when all is calm and serene.

          And all that are upright in heart after him Some read, after it, that
          is, after righteousness; but as by righteousness here we are to
          understand the equal and harmonious government which prevails when God
          takes vengeance upon the wicked and delivers his own people, this
          rendering will scarcely suit. It would rather seem that God himself is
          to be understood, so that the relative is here without an antecedent.
          In the Hebrew, when mention is made of God, the relative is not
          unfrequently put instead of the name. The words then mean, that upon
          God's restoring order in the world, his people would be encouraged to
          follow him with greater alacrity. Even when called to bear the cross,
          they sigh after him under their troubles and distresses, but it binds
          them more closely to his service when they see his hand stretched
          forth in this visible manner, and sensibly experience his deliverance.
