          1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! O Jehovah my God! thou art exceeding
          great; thou hast clothed thyself with praise and glory.2. Being
          arrayed with light as with a garment; and spreading out the heavens as
          a curtain: 3. Laying the beams of his upper rooms in the waters;
          making the clouds his chariot; and walking upon the wings of the wind;
          4. Making the winds his messengers; and his ministers a flaming fire.

          1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul! After having exhorted himself to praise
          God, the Psalmist adds, that there is abundant matter for such an
          exercise; thus indirectly condemning himself and others of
          ingratitude, if the praises of God, than which nothing ought to be
          better known, or more celebrated, are buried by silence. In comparing
          the light with which he represents God as arrayed to a garment, he
          intimates, that although God is invisible, yet his glory is
          conspicuous enough. In respect of his essence, God undoubtedly dwells
          in light that is inaccessible; but as he irradiates the whole world by
          his splendor, this is the garment in which He, who is hidden in
          himself, appears in a manner visible to us. The knowledge of this
          truth is of the greatest importance. If men attempt to reach the
          infinite height to which God is exalted, although they fly above the
          clouds, they must fail in the midst of their course. Those who seek to
          see him in his naked majesty are certainly very foolish. That we may
          enjoy the light of him, he must come forth to view with his clothing;
          that is to say, we must cast our eyes upon the very beautiful fabric
          of the world in which he wishes to be seen by us, and not be too
          curious and rash in searching into his secret essence. Now, since God
          presents himself to us clothed with light, those who are seeking
          pretexts for their living without the knowledge of him, cannot allege
          in excuse of their slothfulness, that he is hidden in profound
          darkness. When it is said that the heavens are a curtain, it is not
          meant that under them God hides himself, but that by them his majesty
          and glory are displayed; being, as it were, his royal pavilion.

          3. Laying the beams of his chambers in the waters David now proceeds
          to explain at greater length what he had briefly stated under the
          figure of God's raiment. The scope of the passage is shortly this,
          that we need not pierce our way above the clouds for the purpose of
          finding God, since he meets us in the fabric of the world, and is
          everywhere exhibiting to our view scenes of the most vivid
          description. That we may not imagine that there is any thing in Him
          derived, as if, by the creation of the world, he received any addition
          to his essential perfection and glory, we must remember that he
          clothes himself with this robe for our sake. The metaphorical
          representation of God, as laying the beams of his chambers in the
          waters, seems somewhat difficult to understand; but it was the design
          of the prophet, from a thing incomprehensible to us, to ravish us with
          the greater admiration. Unless beams be substantial and strong, they
          will not be able to sustain even the weight of an ordinary house.
          When, therefore, God makes the waters the foundation of his heavenly
          palace, who can fail to be astonished at a miracle so wonderful? When
          we take into account our slowness of apprehension, such hyperbolical
          expressions are by no means superfluous; for it is with difficulty
          that they awaken and enable us to attain even a slight knowledge of
          God.

          What is meant by his walking upon the wings of the wind, is rendered
          more obvious from the following verse, where it is said, that the
          winds are his messengers God rides on the clouds, and is carried upon
          the wings of the wind, inasmuch as he drives about the winds and
          clouds at his pleasure, and by sending them hither and thither as
          swiftly as he pleases, shows thereby the signs of his presence. By
          these words we are taught that the winds do not blow by chance, nor
          the lightnings flash by a fortuitous impulse, but that God, in the
          exercise of his sovereign power, rules and controls all the agitations
          and disturbances of the atmosphere. From this doctrine a twofold
          advantage may be reaped. In the first place, if at any time noxious
          winds arise, if the south wind corrupt the air, or if the north wind
          scorch the corn, and not only tear up trees by the root, but overthrow
          houses, and if other winds destroy the fruits of the earth, we ought
          to tremble under these scourges of Providence. In the second place,
          if, on the other hand, God moderate the excessive heat by a gentle
          cooling breeze, if he purify the polluted atmosphere by the north
          wind, or if he moisten the parched ground by south winds; in this we
          ought to contemplate his goodness.

          As the apostle, who writes to the Hebrews, (Hebrews 1:7) quotes this
          passage, and applies it to the angels, both the Greek and Latin
          expositors have almost unanimously considered David as here speaking
          allegorically. In like manner, because Paul, in quoting Psalm 19:4, in
          his Epistle to the Romans, (Romans 10:18) seems to apply to the
          apostles what is there stated concerning the heavens, the whole psalm
          has been injudiciously expounded as if it were an allegory. The design
          of the apostle, in that part of the Epistle to the Hebrews referred
          to, was not simply to explain the mind of the prophet in this place;
          but since God is exhibited to us, as it were, visibly in a mirror, the
          apostle very properly lays down the analogy between the obedience
          which the winds manifestly and perceptibly yield to God, and that
          obedience which he receives from the angels. In short, the meaning is,
          that as God makes use of the winds as his messengers, turns them
          hither and thither, calms and raises them whenever he pleases, that by
          their ministry he may declare his power, so the angels were created to
          execute his commands. And certainly we profit little in the
          contemplation of universal nature, if we do not behold with the eyes
          of faith that spiritual glory of which an image is presented to us in
          the world.<br />
