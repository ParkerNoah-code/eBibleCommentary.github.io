        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.16)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 25th, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>|For behold he prayeth| -- Acts 9:11.</p>
        <p>
          GOD has many methods of quenching persecution. He will not suffer his
          church to be injured by its enemies, or overwhelmed by its foes; and
          he is not short of means for turning aside the way of the wicked, or
          of turning it upside down. In two ways he usually accomplishes his
          end; sometimes by the confusion of the persecutor, and at others in a
          more blessed manner, by his conversion. Sometimes, he confuses and
          confounds his enemies; he makes the diviner mad; he lets the man who
          comes against him be utterly destroyed, suffers him to drive on to his
          own destruction, and then at last turns round in triumphant derision
          upon the man who hoped to have said aha! aha! To the church of God.
          But at other times, as in this case, he converts the persecutor. Thus,
          he transforms the foe into a friend; he makes the man who was a
          warrior against the gospel a soldier for it. Out of darkness he
          bringeth forth light; out of the eater he getteth honey; yea, out of
          stony hearts he raiseth up children unto Abraham. Such was the case
          with Saul. A more furious bigot it is impossible to conceive. He had
          been bespattered with the blood of Stephen, when they stoned him to
          death; so officious was he in his cruelty, that the men left their
          clothes in the charge of a young man named Saul. Living at Jerusalem,
          in the college of Gamaliel, he constantly came in contact with the
          disciples of the Man of Nazareth; he laughed at them, he reviled them
          as they passed along the street; he procured enactments against them,
          and put them to death; and now, as a crowning point, this were-wolf,
          having tasted blood, becomes exceeding mad, determines to go to
          Damascus, that he may glut himself with the gore of men and women;
          that he may bind the Christians, and bring them to Jerusalem, there to
          suffer what he considered to be a just punishment for their heresy,
          and departure from their ancient religion. But oh, how marvelous was
          the power of God! Jesus stays this man in his mad career; just as with
          his lance in rest he was dashing against Christ. Christ met him,
          unhorsed him, threw him on the ground, and questioned him, |Saul,
          Saul, why persecutest thou me?| He then graciously removed his
          rebellious heart -- gave him a new heart and a right spirit -- turned
          his aim and object -- led him to Damascus -- laid him prostrate for
          three days and nights -- spoke to him -- made mystic sounds go
          murmuring through his ears -- set his whole soul on fire; and when at
          last he started up from that three days' trance, and began to pray,
          then it was that Jesus from heaven descended, came in a vision to
          Ananias, and said, |Arise, and go into the street which is called
          Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of
          Tarsus; for, behold, he prayeth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, our text was an announcement; |Behold, he prayeth.| Secondly,
          it was an argument; |For, behold, he prayeth.| Then, to conclude, we
          will try to make an application of our text to your hearts. Though
          application is the work of God alone, we will trust that he will be
          pleased to make that application while the word is preached this
          morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, here was AN ANNOUNCEMENT; |Go to the house of Saul of
          Tarsus; for behold, he prayeth.| Without any preface, let me say, that
          this was the announcement of a fact which was noticed in heaven; which
          was joyous to the angels; which was astonishing to Ananias, and which
          was a novelty to Saul himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the announcement of a fact which was noticed in heaven. Poor
          Saul had been led to cry for mercy, and the moment he began to pray,
          God began to hear. Do you not notice, in reading the chapter, what
          attention God paid to Saul? He knew the street where he lived; |Go to
          the street that is called Straight.| He knew the house where he
          resided; |inquire at the house of Judas.| He knew his name; it was
          Saul. He knew the place where he came from; |Inquire for Saul of
          Tarsus.| And he knew that he had prayed. |Behold, he prayeth.| Oh! It
          is a glorious fact, that prayers are noticed in heaven. The poor
          broken-hearted sinner, climbing up to his chamber, bends his knee, but
          can only utter his wailing in the language of sighs and tears. Lo!
          That groan has made all the harps of heaven thrill with music; that
          tear has been caught by God, and put into the lachrymatory of heaven,
          to be perpetually preserved. The supplicant, whose fears prevent his
          words, will be well understood by the Most High. He may only shed one
          hasty tear; but |prayer is the falling of a tear.| Tears are the
          diamonds of heaven; sighs are a part of the music of Jehovah's throne;
          for though prayers be
        </p>
        <p>|The simplest form of speech</p>
        <p>That infant lips can try;|</p>
        <p>so are they likewise the</p>
        <p>|Sublimest strains that reach The majesty on high.|</p>
        <p>
          Let me dilate on this thought a moment. Prayers are noticed in heaven.
          Oh! I know what is the case with many of you. You think, |If I turn to
          God, if I seek him, surely I am so inconsiderable a being, so guilty
          and vile, that it cannot be imagined he would take any notice of me.|
          My friends, harbor no such heathenish ideas. Our God is no god who
          sits in one perpetual dream; nor doth he clothe himself in such thick
          darkness that he cannot see; he is not like Baal who heareth not.
          True, he may not regard battles; he cares not for the pomp and
          pageantry of kings; he listens not to the swell of martial music; he
          regards not the triumph and the pride of man; but wherever there is a
          heart big with sorrow, wherever there is an eye suffused with tears,
          wherever there is a lip quivering with agony, wherever there is a deep
          groan, or a penitential sigh, the ear of Jehovah is wide open; he
          marks it down in the registry of his memory; he puts our prayers, like
          rose leaves, between the pages of his book of remembrance, and when
          the volume is opened at last there shall be a precious fragrance
          springing up therefrom. Oh! Poor sinner, of the blackest and vilest
          character, thy prayers are heard, and even now God hath said of thee,
          |Behold, he prayeth.| Where was it -- in a barn? Where was it -- in
          the closet? Was it at thy bedside this morning, or in this hall? Art
          thou now glancing thine eye to heaven? Speak, poor heart; did I hear
          thy lips just now mutter out, |God have mercy upon me, a sinner?| I
          tell thee, sinner, there is one thing which doth outstrip the
          telegraph. You know we can now send a message and receive an answer in
          a few moments; but I read of something in the Bible more swift than
          the electric fluid. |Before they call I will answer, and while they
          are speaking I will hear.| So, then, poor sinner, thou art noticed;
          yea, thou art heard by him that sitteth on the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; this was the announcement of a fact joyous to heaven. Our text
          is prefaced with |Behold,| for doubtless, our Saviour himself regarded
          it with joy. Once only do we read of a smile resting upon the
          countenance of Jesus, when, lifting up his eye to heaven, he
          exclaimed, |I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because
          thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
          revealed them unto babes; even so, Father; for so it seemed good in
          thy sight.| The shepherd of our souls rejoices in the vision of his
          sheep securely folded, he triumphs in spirit when he brings a wanderer
          home. I conceive that when he spoke these words to Ananias, one of the
          smiles of Paradise must have shone from his eyes. |Behold,| I have won
          the heart of my enemy, I have saved my persecutor, even now he is
          bending the knee at my footstool, |behold, he prayeth.| Jesus himself
          led the song, rejoicing over the new convert with singing. Jesus
          Christ was glad, and rejoiced more over that lost sheep than over
          ninety and nine that went not astray. And angels rejoiced too. Why,
          when one of God's elect is born, angels stand around his cradle. He
          grows up, and runs into sin: angels follow him, tracking him all his
          way; they gaze with sorrow upon his many wanderings; the fair Peri
          drops a tear whene'er that loved one sins. Presently the man is
          brought under the sound of the gospel. The angel says, |Behold, he
          begins to hear.| He waits a little while, the word sinks into his
          heart, a tear runs down his cheek, and at last he cries from his
          inmost soul, |God have mercy upon me!| See! The angel claps his wings,
          up he flies to heaven, and says, |Brethren angels, list to me, Behold,
          he prayeth.'| Then they set heaven's bells ringing; they have a
          jubilee in glory; again they shout with gladsome voices, for verily I
          tell you, |there is joy in heaven among the angels of God over one
          sinner that repenteth.| They watch us till we pray, and when we pray,
          they say, |Behold, he prayeth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, my dear friends, there may be other spirits in heaven that
          rejoice, besides the angels. Those persons are our friends who have
          gone before us. I have not many relations in heaven, but I have one
          whom I dearly love, who, I doubt not, often prayed for me, for she
          nursed me when I was a child and brought me up during part of my
          infancy, and now she sits before the throne in glory -- suddenly
          snatched away. I fancy she looked upon her darling grandson, and as
          she saw him in the ways of sin, and vice, and folly, she could not
          look with sorrow, for there are no tears in the eyes of glorified
          ones; she could not look with regret, because they cannot know such a
          feeling before the throne of God; but ah! That moment when, by
          sovereign grace, I was constrained to pray, when all alone I bent my
          knee and wrestled, methinks I see her as she said, |Behold, he
          prayeth; behold, he prayeth.| Oh! I can picture her countenance. She
          seemed to have two heavens for a moment, a double bliss, a heaven in
          me as well as in herself -- when she could say, |Behold, he prayeth.|
          Ah! young man, there is your mother walking the golden streets. She is
          looking down upon you this hour. She nursed you; on her breast you lay
          when but a child, and she consecrated you to Jesus Christ. From
          heaven, she has been watching you with that intense anxiety which is
          compatible with happiness; this morning she is looking upon you. What
          sayest thou, young man? Does Christ by his Spirit say in thine heart,
          |Come unto me?| Dost thou drop the tear of repentance? Methinks I see
          thy mother as she cries, |Behold, he prayeth.| Once more she bends
          before the throne of God and says, |I thank thee, O thou ever gracious
          One, that he who was my child on earth, has now become thy child in
          light.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, if there is one in heaven who has more joy than another over the
          conversion of a sinner, it is a minister, one of God's true ministers.
          O, my hearers, ye little think how God's true ministers do love your
          souls. Perhaps ye think it is easy work to stand here and preach to
          you. God knows, if that were all, it were easy work; but when we think
          that when we speak to you, your salvation or damnation, in some
          measure, depends upon what we say -- when we reflect that if we are
          unfaithful watchmen, your blood will God require at our hands -- O,
          good God! When I reflect that I have preached to thousands in my
          lifetime, many thousands and have perhaps said many things I ought not
          to have said, it startles me, it makes me shake and tremble. Luther
          said he could face his enemies, but could not go up his pulpit stairs
          without his knees knocking together. Preaching is not child's play; it
          is not a thing to be done without labor and anxiety; it is solemn
          work; it is awful work, if you view it in its relation to eternity.
          Ah! How God's minister prays for you! If you might have listened under
          the eaves of his chamber window, you would have heard him groaning
          every Sunday night over his sermons because he had not spoken with
          more effect; you would have heard him pleading with God, |Who hath
          believed our report? To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?| Ah,
          when he observes you from his rest in heaven -- when he sees you
          praying, how will he clap his hands and say, |Behold the child thou
          hast given me! Behold, he prays.| I am sure when we see one brought to
          know the Lord, we feel very much like one who has saved a
          fellow-creature from being drowned. There is a poor man in the flood;
          he is going down, he is sinking, he must be drowned; but I spring in,
          grasp him firmly, lift him on the shore, and lay him on the ground;
          the physician comes; he looks at him, he puts his hand upon him, and
          says, |I am afraid he is dead.| We apply all the means in our power,
          we do what we can to restore life. I feel that I have been that man's
          deliverer, and oh, how I stoop down and put my ear beside his mouth!
          At last I say, |He breathes! He breathes!| What pleasure there is in
          that thought! He breathes; there is life still. So when we find a man
          praying, we shout -- he breathes; he is not dead, he is alive; for
          while a man prays he is not dead in trespasses and sins, but is
          brought to life, is quickened by the power of the Spirit. |Behold, he
          prayeth.| This was joyful news in heaven, as well as being noticed by
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in the next place, this was an event most astonishing to men.
          Ananias lifted up both his hands in amazement. |O my Lord, I should
          have thought anybody would pray but that man! Is it possible?| I do
          not know how it is with other ministers, but sometimes I look upon
          such-and-such individuals in the congregation, and I say, |Well, they
          are very hopeful; I think I shall have them. I trust there is a work
          going on, and hope soon to hear them tell what the Lord has done for
          their souls.| Soon, perhaps, I see nothing of them, and miss them
          altogether; but instead thereof, my good Master sends me one of whom I
          had no hope -- an outcast, a drunkard, a reprobate, to the praise of
          the glory of his grace. Then I lift up my hands in astonishment,
          thinking |I should have thought of anybody rather than you.| I
          remember a circumstance which occurred a little while ago. There was a
          poor man about sixty years old; he had been a rough sailor, one of the
          worst men in the village; it was his custom to drink, and he seemed to
          be delighted when he was cursing and swearing. He came into the
          chapel, however, one Sabbath day, when one nearly related to me was
          preaching from the text concerning Jesus weeping over Jerusalem. And
          the poor man thought, |What! did Jesus Christ ever weep over such a
          wretch as I am?| He thought he was too bad for Christ to care for him.
          At last he came to the minister, and said, |Sir, sixty years have I
          been sailing under the standard of the devil; it is time I should have
          a new owner; I want to scuttle the old ship and sink her altogether!
          then I shall have a new one, and I shall sail under the colors of
          Prince Immanuel.| Ever since that moment that man has been a praying
          character, walking before God in all sincerity. Yet, he was the very
          last man you would have thought of. Somehow God does choose the last
          men; he does not care for the diamond, but he picks up the
          pebble-stones, for he is able, out of |stones, to raise up children
          unto Abraham.| God is more wise than the chemist: he not only refines
          gold, but he transmutes base metal into precious jewels; he takes the
          filthiest and the vilest, and fashions them into glorious beings,
          makes them saints, whereas they have been sinners, and sanctifies
          them, whereas they have been unholy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversion of Saul was a strange thing; but, beloved, was it
          stranger than that you and I should have been Christians? Let me ask
          you if anybody had told you, a few years ago, that you would belong to
          a church and be numbered with the children of God what would you have
          said? |Stuff and nonsense! I am not one of your canting Methodists; I
          am not going to have any religion; I love to think and do as I like.|
          Did not you and I say so? And how on earth did we get here? When we
          look at the change that has passed over us, it appears like a dream.
          God has left many in our families who were better than we were, and
          why has he chosen us? Oh! Is it not strange? Might we not lift up our
          hands in astonishment, as Ananias did, and say, |Behold, behold,
          behold: it is a miracle on earth, a wonder in heaven?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The last thing I have to say here, is this -- this fact was a novelty
          to Saul himself. |Behold he prayeth.| What is there novel in that?
          Saul used to go up to the temple twice a day, at the hour of prayer.
          If you could have accompanied him, you would have heard him speak
          beautifully, in words like these: |Lord, I thank thee I am not as
          other men are; I am not an extortioner, nor a publican; I fast twice
          in the week, and give tithes of all I possess;| and so on. Oh! You
          might have found him pouring out a fine oration before the throne of
          God. And yet it saith, |Behold, he prayeth.| What! Had he never prayed
          before? No, never. All he had ever done before went for nothing; it
          was not prayer. I have heard of an old gentleman, who was taught when
          a child to pray, |Pray God bless my father and mother,| and he kept on
          praying the same thing for seventy years, when his parents were both
          dead. After that it pleased God, in his infinite mercy, to touch his
          heart, and he was led to see that notwithstanding his constancy to his
          forms, he had not been praying at all; he often said his prayers, but
          never prayed. So it was with Saul. He had pronounced his magniloquent
          orations, but they were all good-for-nothing. He had prayed his long
          prayers for a pretense; it had all been a failure. Now comes a true
          petition, and it is said, |Behold, he prayeth.| Do you see that man
          trying to obtain a hearing from his Maker? How he stands! He speaks
          Latin and blank verse before the Almighty's throne; but God sits in
          calm indifference, paying no attention. Then the man tries a different
          style; procures a book, and bending his knee again, prays in a
          delightful form the best old prayer that could ever be put together;
          but the Most High disregards his empty formalities. At last the poor
          creature throws the book away, forgets his blank verse, and says, |O
          Lord, hear, for Christ's sake.| |Hear him,| says God, |I have heard
          him.| There is the mercy thou hast sought. One hearty prayer is better
          than ten thousand forms. One prayer coming from the soul is better
          than a myriad cold readings. As for prayers that spring from the mouth
          and head only, God abhors them; he loves those that come deep from the
          heart. Perhaps I should be impudent if I were to say that there are
          hundreds here this morning who never prayed once in their lives. There
          are some of you who never did. There is one young man over there, who
          told his parents when he left them, that he should always go through
          his form of prayer every morning and night. But he is ashamed, and he
          has left it off. Well, young man, what will you do when you come to
          die? Will you have |the watchword at the gates of death?| Will you
          |enter heaven by prayer?| No, you will not; you will be driven from
          his presence, and be cast away.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, we have here AN ARGUMENT. |For, behold he prayeth.| It
          was an argument, first of all, for Ananias' safety. Poor Ananias was
          afraid to go to Saul; he thought it was very much like stepping into a
          lion's den. |If I go to his house,| he thought, |the moment he sees
          me, he will take me to Jerusalem at once, for I am one of Christ's
          disciples; I dare not go.| God says, |Behold, he prayeth.| |Well,|
          says Ananias, |that is enough for me. If he is a praying man, he will
          not hurt me; if he is a man of real devotion, I am safe.| Be sure you
          may always trust a praying man. I do not know how it is, but even
          ungodly men always pay a reverence to a sincere Christian. A master
          likes to have a praying servant after all; if he does not regard
          religion himself, he likes to have a pious servant, and he will trust
          him rather than any other. True, there are some of your professedly
          praying people that have not a bit of prayer in them. But whenever you
          find a really praying man, trust him with untold gold; for if he
          really prays, you need not be afraid of him. He who communes with God
          in secret, may be trusted in public. I always feel safe with a man who
          is a visitor at the mercy-seat. I nave heard an anecdote of two
          gentlemen traveling together, somewhere in Switzerland. Presently they
          came into the midst of the forests; and you know the gloomy tales the
          people tell about the inns there, how dangerous it is to lodge in
          them. One of them, an infidel, said to the other, who was a Christian,
          |I don't like stopping here at all; it is very dangerous indeed.|
          |Well,| said the other, |let us try.| So they went into a house; but
          it looked so suspicious that neither of them liked it; and they
          thought they would prefer being at home in England. Presently the
          landlord said, |Gentlemen, I always read and pray with my family
          before going to bed; will you allow me to do so to-night?| |Yes,| they
          said, |with the greatest pleasure.| When they went up-stairs, the
          infidel said, |I am not at all afraid now.| |Why?| said the Christian.
          |Because our host has prayed.| |Oh!| said the other, |then it seems,
          after all, you think something of religion; because a man prays, you
          can go to sleep in his house.| And it was marvelous how both of them
          did sleep. Sweet dreams they had, for they felt that where the house
          had been roofed by prayer, and walled with devotion, there could not
          be found a man living that would commit an injury to them. This, then,
          was an argument to Ananias, that he might go with safety to Saul's
          house.
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than this. Here was an argument for Paul's sincerity. Secret
          prayer is one of the best tests of sincere religion. If Jesus had said
          to Ananias, |Behold, he preacheth,| Ananias would have said, |that he
          may do, and yet be a deceiver.| If he had said, |He has gone to a
          meeting of the church,| Ananias would have said, |He may enter there
          as a wolf in sheep's clothing.| But when he said, |Behold, he prays,|
          that was argument enough. A young person comes and tells me about what
          he has felt and what he has been doing. At last I say, |kneel down and
          pray.| |I would much rather not.| |Never mind, you shall.| Down he
          falls on his knees, he has hardly a word to say; he begins groaning
          and crying, and there he stays on his knees till at last he stammers
          out, |Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner; I am the greatest of sinners;
          have mercy upon me!| Then I am a little more satisfied, and I say, |I
          did not mind all your talk, I wanted your prayers.| But oh! If I could
          trace him home; if I could see him go and pray alone, then I should
          feel sure; for he who prays in private is a real Christian. The mere
          reading of a book of daily devotion will not prove you a child of God;
          if you pray in private, then you have a sincere religion; a little
          religion, if sincere, is better than mountains of pretense. Home piety
          is the best piety. Praying will make you leave off sinning, or sinning
          will make you leave off praying. Prayer in the heart proves the
          reality of conversion. A man may be sincere, but sincerely wrong. Paul
          was sincerely right. |Behold, he prayeth,| was the best argument that
          his religion was right. If any one should ask me for an epitome of the
          Christian religion, I should say it is in that one word -- |prayer.|
          If I should be asked, |What will take in the whole Christian
          experience?| I should answer, |prayer.| A man must have been convinced
          of sin before he could pray; he must have had some hope that there was
          mercy for him before he could pray. In fact, all the Christian virtues
          are locked up in that word, prayer. Do but tell me you are a man of
          prayer, and I will reply at once, |Sir, I have no doubt of the
          reality, as well as the sincerity, of your religion.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But one more thought, and I will leave this subject. It was a proof of
          this man's election, for you read directly afterwards, |Behold, he is
          a chosen vessel.| I often find people troubling themselves about the
          doctrine of election. Every now and then I get a letter from somebody
          or other taking me to task for preaching election. All the answer I
          can give is, |There it is in the Bible; go and ask my Master why he
          put it there. I cannot help it. I am only a serving man, and I tell
          you the message from above. If I were a footman, I should not alter my
          master's message at the door. I happen to be an ambassador of heaven,
          and I dare not alter the message I have received. If it is wrong, send
          up to head-quarters. There it is, and I cannot alter it.| This much
          let me say in explanation. Some say, |How can I discover whether I am
          God's elect? I am afraid I am not God's elect.| Do you pray? If it can
          be said, |Behold, he prayeth,| it can also be said, Behold, he is a
          chosen vessel.| Have you faith? If so, you are elect. Those are the
          marks of election. If you have none of these, you have no grounds for
          concluding that you belong to the peculiar people of God. Have you a
          desire to believe? Have you a wish to love Christ? Have you the
          millionth part of a desire to come to Christ? And is it a practical
          desire? Does it lead you to offer earnest, tearful supplication? If
          so, never be afraid of non-election; for whoever prays with sincerity,
          is ordained of God before the foundation of the world, that he should
          be holy and without blame before Christ in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now for the APPLICATION. A word or two with you, my dear friends,
          before I send you away this morning. I regret that I cannot better
          enter into the subject; but my glorious Master requires of each of us
          according to what we have, not according to what we have not. I am
          deeply conscious that I fail in urging home the truth so solemnly as I
          ought; Nevertheless, |my work is with God and my judgement with my
          God,| and the last day shall reveal that my error lay in judgment, but
          not in sincere affection for souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, allow me to address the children of God. Do you not see, my
          dear brethren, that the best mark of our being sons of God is to be
          found in our devotion? |Behold, he prayeth.| Well, then, does it not
          follow, as a natural consequence, that the more we are found in prayer
          the brighter will our evidences be? Perhaps you have lost your
          evidence this morning; you do not know whether you are a child of God
          or not; I will tell you where you lost your confidence -- you lost it
          in your closet. I speak what I have felt. I have often gone back from
          God -- never so as to fall finally, I know, but I have often lost that
          sweet savor of his love which I once enjoyed. I have had to cry,
        </p>
        <p>|Those peaceful hours I once enjoyed,</p>
        <p>How sweet their memory still!</p>
        <p>But they have left an aching void,</p>
        <p>The world can never fill.|</p>
        <p>
          I have gone up to God's house to preach, without either fire or
          energy; I have read the Bible, and there has been no light upon it; I
          have tried to have communion with God, but all has been a failure.
          Shall I tell where that commenced! It commenced in my closet. I had
          ceased, in a measure, to pray. Here I stand, and do confess my faults;
          I do acknowledge that whenever I depart from God it is there it doth
          begin. O Christians, would you be happy? Be much in prayer. Would ye
          be victorious? Be much in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>|Restraining prayer, we cease to fight,</p>
        <p>Prayer makes the Christian's armor bright.|</p>
        <p>
          Mrs. Berry used to say, |I would not be hired out of my closet for a
          thousand worlds.| Mr. Jay said, |If the twelve apostles were living
          near you, and you had access to them, if this intercourse drew you
          from the closet, they would prove a real injury to your souls.| Prayer
          is the ship which bringeth home the richest freight. It is the soil
          which yields the most abundant harvest. Brother, when you rise in the
          morning your business so presses, that with a hurried word or two,
          down you go into the world, and at night, jaded and tired, you give
          God the fag end of the day. The consequence is, that you have no
          communion with him. The reason we have not more true religion now, is
          because we have not more prayer. Sirs, I have no opinion of the
          churches of the present day that do not pray. I go from chapel to
          chapel in this metropolis and I see pretty good congregations; but I
          go to their prayer-meetings on a week evening, and I see a dozen
          persons. Can God bless us, can he pour out his Spirit upon us, while
          such things as these exist? He could, but it would not be according to
          the order of his dispensations, for he says, |When Zion travails she
          brings forth children.| Go to your churches and chapels with this
          thought, that you want more prayer. Many of you have no business here
          this morning. You ought to be in your own places of worship. I do not
          want to steal away the people from other chapels; there are enough to
          hear me without them. But though you have sinned this morning, hear
          while you are here, as much to your profit as possible. Go home and
          say to your minister, |Sir, we must have more prayer.| Urge the people
          to more prayer. Have a prayer-meeting, even if you have it all to
          yourself; and if you are asked how many were present, you can say,
          |Four.| |Four! How so?| |Why, there was myself, and God the Father,
          God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; and we have had a rich and real
          communion together.| We must have an outpouring of real devotion, or
          else what is to become of many of our churches? O! May God awaken us
          all, and stir us up to pray, for when we pray we shall be victorious.
          I should like to take you this morning, as Samson did the foxes, tie
          the firebrands of prayer to you, and send you in among the shocks of
          corn till you burn the whole up. I should like to make a conflagration
          by my words, and to set all the churches on fire, till the whole has
          smoked like a sacrifice to God's throne. If you pray, you have a proof
          that you are a Christian; the less you pray, the less reason have you
          to believe your Christianity; and if you have neglected to pray
          altogether, then you have ceased to breathe, and you may be afraid
          that you never did breathe at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my last word is to the ungodly. O, sirs! I could fain wish
          myself anywhere but here; for if it be solemn work to address the
          godly, how much more when I come to deal with you. We fear lest, on
          the one hand, we should so speak to you as to make you trust in your
          own strength; while, on the other hand, we tremble lest we should lull
          you into the sleep of sloth and security. I believe most of us feel
          some difficulty as to the most fit manner to preach to you -- not that
          we doubt but that the gospel is to be preached -- but our desire is so
          to do it, that we may win your souls. I feel like a watchman, who,
          while guarding a city, is oppressed with sleep; how earnestly does he
          strive to arouse himself, while infirmity would overcome him. The
          remembrance of his responsibility bestirs him. His is no lack of will,
          but of power; and so I hope all the watchmen of the Lord are anxious
          to be faithful, while, at the same time, they know their imperfection.
          Truly, the minister of Christ will feel like the old keeper of
          Eddystone lighthouse; life was failing fast, but, summoning all his
          strength, he crept round once more to trim the lights before he died.
          O may the Holy Spirit enable us to keep the beacon-fire blazing, to
          warn you of the rocks, shoals, and quicksands, which surround you, and
          may we ever guide you to Jesus, and not to free-will or creature
          merit. If my friends knew how anxiously I have sought divine direction
          in the important matter of preaching to sinners, they would not feel
          as some of them do, when they fancy I address them wrongly. I want to
          do as God bids me, and if he tells me to speak to the dry bones and
          they shall live, I must do it, even if it does not please others;
          otherwise I should be condemned in my own conscience, and condemned of
          God. Now, with all the solemnity that man can summon, let me say that
          a prayerless soul is a Christless soul. As the Lord liveth, you who
          never prayed are without God, without hope, and strangers from the
          commonwealth of Israel. You who never know what a groan is, or a
          falling tear, are destitute of vital godliness. Let me ask you, sirs,
          whether you have ever thought in what an awful state you are? You are
          far from God, and therefore God is angry with you; for |God is angry
          with the wicked every day.| O, sinner! Lift thine eyes and behold the
          frowning countenance of God, for he is angry with you. And I beseech
          you, as you love yourselves, just for one moment contemplate what will
          become of you, if living as you are, ye should at last die without
          prayer. Don't think that one prayer on your deathbed will save you.
          Deathbed prayer is a deathbed farce generally, and passes for nothing;
          it is a coin that will not ring in heaven, but is stamped by
          hypocrisy, and made of base metal. Take heed sirs. Let me ask you, if
          you have never prayed, what will you do? It were a good thing for you,
          if death were an eternal sleep; but it is not. If you find yourself in
          hell, oh, the racks and pains! But I will not harrow up your feelings
          by attempting to describe them. May God grant you never may feel the
          torments of the lost. Only conceive that poor wretch in the flames who
          is saying, |O for one drop of water, to cool my parched tongue!| See
          how his tongue hangs from between his blistered lips! How it
          excoriates and burns the roof of his mouth, as if it were a firebrand.
          Behold him crying for a drop of water. I will not picture the scene.
          Suffice it for me to close up by saying, that the hell of hells will
          be to thee, poor sinner, the thought that it is to be forever. Thou
          wilt look up there on the throne of God, and it shall be written
          |forever!| When the damned jingle the burning irons of their torments,
          they shall say |forever!| When they howl, echo cries |forever!|
        </p>
        <p>|Forever' is written on their racks,</p>
        <p>'Forever' on their chains;</p>
        <p>'Forever' burneth in the fire,</p>
        <p>'Forever' ever reigns.|</p>
        <p>
          Doleful thought! |If I could but get out, then I should be happy. If
          there were a hope of deliverance, then I might be peaceful; but I am
          here forever!| Sirs, if ye would escape eternal torments, if ye would
          be found amongst the numbers of the blessed, the road to heaven can
          only be found by prayer -- by prayer to Jesus, by prayer for the
          Spirit, by supplication at his mercy seat. |Turn ye, turn ye, why will
          ye die, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord, I have no
          pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had rather that he should
          turn unto me and live.| |The Lord is gracious and full of compassion.|
          Let us go unto him and say, |He shall heal our backslidings, he shall
          love us freely and forgive us graciously, for his Son's name's sake.|
          Oh! If I may but win one soul to-day, I will go home contented. If I
          may but gain twenty, then I will rejoice. The more I have, the more
          crowns I shall wear. Wear! No, I will take them all at once, and cast
          them at Jesus' feet, and say, |Not unto me, but unto thy name be all
          the glory, forever.|
        </p>
        <p>|Prayer was appointed to convey</p>
        <p>The blessings god designs to give;</p>
        <p>Long as they live, should Christians pray,</p>
        <p>For only while they pray, they live.</p>
        <p>|And wilt thou still in silence lie,</p>
        <p>When Christ stands waiting for thy prayer?</p>
        <p>My soul, thou hast a friend on high,</p>
        <p>Arise, and try thine interest there.</p>
        <p>|Tis prayer supports the soul that's weak,</p>
        <p>Though thought be broken, language lame;</p>
        <p>Pray, if thou canst, or canst not speak,</p>
        <p>And pray with faith in Jesus' name.|<br /></p>
