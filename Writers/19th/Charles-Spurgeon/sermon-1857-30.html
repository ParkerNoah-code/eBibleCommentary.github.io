        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.136)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 14, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of
          the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God
          Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.| --
          Revelation 15:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          AT THE OUTSET, let us remark the carefulness of the Holy Spirit in
          guarding the honor of our blessed Lord. This verse is often quoted as
          if it runs thus -- |They sang the song of Moses and the Lamb.| This
          mistake has led many weak minds to wonder at the expression, for they
          have imagined that it divided the honor of the song of heaven between
          Moses and the Redeemer. The clause -- |the servant of God| -- is
          doubtless inserted by the Holy Spirit to prevent any error upon this
          point, and therefore it should be carefully included in the quotation.
          I take it that the song of Moses is here united with the song of the
          Lamb, because the one was a type and picture of the other. The
          glorious overthrow of Pharaoh in the Red Sea shadowed forth the total
          destruction of Satan and all his host in the day of the great battle
          of the Lord; and there was in the song of Moses the expression of the
          same feelings of triumph which will pervade the breasts of the
          redeemed when they shall triumph with their Captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God the Holy Spirit enable me to exhibit the parallel which exists
          between the condition of Israel when passing through the sea, and the
          position of the church of Christ at the present day. Next, we shall
          compare the triumph of the Lord at the Red Sea with the victory of the
          Lamb in the great and terrible day of the Lord. And lastly, I shall
          point out certain prominent features of the song of Moses, which will
          doubtless be as prominent in the song of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, it is our business to regard THE POSITION OF THE CHILDREN OF
          ISRAEL AS EMBLEMATICAL OF OUR OWN. And here we observe that, like the
          church of God, the vast host of Israel had been delivered from
          bondage. We, my brethren, who constitute a part of the Israel of God,
          were once the slaves of sin and Satan; we served with hard bondage and
          rigor while in our natural state; no bondage was ever more terrible
          than ours; we indeed made bricks without straw, and labored in the
          very fire; but by the strong hand of God we have been delivered. We
          have come forth from the prison-house; with joy we beheld ourselves
          emancipated -- the Lord's free men. The iron yoke is taken from our
          necks; we no longer serve our lusts, and pay obedience to the tyrant
          sin. With a high hand and an outstretched arm, our God has led us
          forth from the place of our captivity, and joyfully we pursue our way
          through the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with the children of Israel it was not all joy; they were free,
          but their master was at their heels. Pharaoh was loth to lose so
          valuable a nation of servants; and therefore with his chosen captains,
          his horsemen, and his chariots, he pursued them in angry haste.
          Affrighted Israel beheld her infuriated oppressor close at her rear,
          and trembled for the issue -- the hearts of the people failed them
          while they saw their hopes blighted and their joys ended by the
          approach of the oppressor; even so it is with some of you; you think
          you must be driven back again like dumb cattle, into Egypt, and once
          more become what you were. |Surely,| you say, |I can not hold on my
          way with such a host seeking to drive me back; I must again become the
          slave of my iniquities.| And thus dreading apostacy, and feeling that
          you would rather die than become what you were, you this morning are
          filled with trepidation. You are saying, |Alas for me! Better that I
          had died in Egypt than that I should have come out into this
          wilderness to be again captured.| You have tasted for a moment the
          joys of holiness and the sweets of liberty; and now again to go back
          to endure the bondage of a spiritual Egypt, would be worse than
          before. This is the position of the sacramental host of God's elect;
          they have come out of Egypt, and they are pursuing their way to
          Canaan. But the world is against them; the kings of the earth stand
          up, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against
          his people, saying, |Let us scatter them; let us utterly destroy
          them.| From the fiery days of the stakes of Smithfield even until now,
          the world's black heart has hated the church, and the world's cruel
          hand and laughing lip have been for ever against us. The host of the
          mighty are pursuing us, and are thirsty for our blood, and anxious to
          cut us off from the earth. Such is our position unto this hour, and
          such must it be until we are landed on the other side of Jordan, and
          until our Maker comes to reign on the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once more: the children of Israel were in a position more
          wonderful than this. They came to the edge of the Red Sea; they feared
          their enemies behind; they could not fly on either hand, for they were
          flanked by mountains and stupendous rocks; one course only was open to
          them, and that course was through the sea. God commands them to go
          forward. The rod of Moses is outstretched, and the affrighted waters
          divide; a channel is left while the floods stand up right, and the
          waters are congealed in the heart of the sea. The priests, bearing the
          ark, march forward; the whole host of Israel follow. And now behold
          the wondrous pilgrimage. A wall of alabaster is on either side, and
          myriads are in the pebbly depths. Like a wall of glass the sea stands
          on either side of them, frowning with beetling cliffs of foam; but
          still on they march; and until the last of God's Israel is safe the
          water stands still and firm, frozen by the lips of God. Such, my
          hearers, is the position of God's church now. You and I are marching
          through a sea, the floods of which are kept upright only by the
          sovereign power of God. This world is a world which is suddenly to be
          destroyed; and our position in it is just the position of the children
          of Israel, for whose sake the floods refused to meet until they were
          safely landed. O church of God! thou art the salt of the earth: when
          thou art removed this earth must putrify and decay. O living army of
          the living God! ye, like Israel, keep the floods of providence still
          standing fast; but when the last of you shall be gone from this stage
          of action, God's fiery wrath and tremendous anger shall dash down upon
          the ground whereon you now are standing, and your enemies shall be
          overwhelmed in the place through which you now walk safely. Let me put
          my thoughts as plainly as I can. Naturally, according to the common
          order, the Red Sea should have flowed on in a level and even manner,
          constant in its waves, and unbroken in its surface. By the might of
          God the Red Sea was divided into two parts, and the floods stood back.
          Now mark. Naturally, according to the common course of justice, this
          world, which groaneth and travaileth until now, ought, if we only
          consider the wicked, to be utterly destroyed. The only reason why the
          Red Sea afforded a safe passage for the host was this -- that Israel
          marched through it; and the only reason why this world stands, and the
          only reason why it is not destroyed by fire, as it is to be at the
          last great day, is because God's Israel are in it; but when once they
          shall have passed through, the parted floods shall meet their hands,
          and embrace with eager joy to clasp the adverse host within their
          arms. The day is coming when this world shall reel to and fro and
          stagger like a drunken man. Every Christian may say, with due
          reverence to God, |The earth is dissolved; I bear up the pillars
          thereof.| Let all the Christians that are in the world die, and the
          pillars of the earth would fall, and like a wreck and a vision all
          this universe of ours would pass away, never to be seen again. We are
          to-day, I say, passing through the floods, with enemies behind,
          pursuing us who are going out of Egypt up to Canaan.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now the TRIUMPH OF MOSES was a picture of the ultimate
          triumph of the Lamb. Moses sang a song unto the Lord by the sea of
          Egypt. If you will turn to holy Scripture you will find that my text
          was sung by the holy spirits who had been preserved from sin and from
          the contamination of the beast; and it is said that they sung this
          song upon |a sea of glass mingled with fire.| Now the song of Moses
          was sung by the side of a sea, which was glassy, and still; for a
          little season the floods had been disturbed, divided, separated,
          congealed, but in a few moments afterward, when Israel had safely
          passed the flood, they became as glassy as ever, for the enemy had
          sunken to the bottom like a stone, and the sea re. turned to its
          strength when the morning appeared. Is there ever a time, then, when
          this great sea of Providence, which now stands parted to give a
          passage to God's saints shall become a level surface? Is there a day
          when the now divided dispensations of God, which are kept from
          following out their legitimate tendency to do justice upon sin -- when
          the two seas of justice shall commingle, and the one sea of God's
          providence shall be |a sea of glass mingled with fire?| Yes, the day
          is drawing nigh when God's enemies shall no longer make it necessary
          for God's providence to be apparently disturbed to save his people,
          when the great designs of God shall be accomplished, and therefore
          when the walls of water shall roll together, while in their inmost
          depths the everlasting burning fire shall still consume the wicked. O,
          the sea shall be calm upon the surface; the sea upon which God's
          people shall walk shall seem to be a sea that is clear, without a
          weed, with-out an impurity; while down in its hollow bosom, far beyond
          all mortal ken, shall be the horrid depths where the wicked must for
          ever dwell in the fire which is mingled with the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I now want to show you why it was that Moses triumphed, and why
          it is that by-and-by we shall triumph. One reason why Moses sung his
          song was because all Israel were safe. They were all safely across the
          sea. Not a drop of spray fell from that solid wall until the last of
          God's Israel had safely planted his foot on the other side of the
          flood. That done, immediately the floods dissolved into their proper
          place again, but not till then. Part of that song was, |Thou hast led
          thy people like a flock through the wilderness.| Now, in the last
          time, when Christ shall come upon earth, the great song will be --
          |Lord, thou hast saved thy people; thou hast led them all safely
          through the paths of providence, and not one of them has fallen into
          the hands of the enemy.| O, it is my strong belief, that in heaven
          there shall not be a vacant throne. I rejoice that all who love the
          Lord below, must at last attain to heaven. I do not believe with some
          that men may start on the road to heaven, and be saved, and yet fall
          by the hand of the enemy. God forbid, my friends!
        </p>
        <p>|All the chosen race</p>
        <p>Shall meet around the throne,</p>
        <p>Shall bless the conduct of his grace,</p>
        <p>And make his glories known.|</p>
        <p>
          Part of the triumph of heaven will be, that there is not one throne
          that is unoccupied. As many as God hath chosen, as many as Christ hath
          redeemed, as many as the Spirit hath called, as many as believe, shall
          arrive safe across the stream. We are not all safely landed yet:
        </p>
        <p>|Part of the host have crossed the flood,</p>
        <p>And part are crossing now.|</p>
        <p>
          The vanguard of the army have already reached the shore. I see them
          yonder;
        </p>
        <p>|I greet the blood-besprinkled bands</p>
        <p>Upon th' eternal shore.|</p>
        <p>
          And you and I, my brethren, are marching through the depths. We are at
          this day following hard after Christ, and walking through the
          wilderness. Let us be of good cheer: the rearguard shall soon be where
          the vanguard already is; the last of the chosen shall soon have
          landed; the last of God's elect shall have crossed the sea, and then
          shall be heard the song of triumph, when all are secure. But O! if one
          were absent -- oh! if one of his chosen family should be cast away --
          it would make an everlasting discord in the song of the redeemed, and
          cut the strings of the harps of Paradise, so that music could never be
          distilled from them again.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, perhaps, the major part of the joy of Moses lay in the
          destruction of all the enemies of God. He looked upon his people the
          day before.
        </p>
        <p>|He looked upon his people,</p>
        <p>And the tear was in his eye;</p>
        <p>He looked upon the foeman</p>
        <p>And his glance was stern and high.|</p>
        <p>
          And now to-day he looks upon his people, and he says, |Blessed art
          thou, O Israel, safely landed on the shore;| and he looks not upon the
          foeman, but upon the foeman's tomb; he looks where the living were
          protected by the shield of God from all their enemies; and he sees --
          what? A mighty sepulcher of water; a mighty tomb in which were
          engulfed princes, monarchs, potentates. |The horse and his rider hath
          he thrown into the sea.| Pharaoh's chariots also are drowned therein.
          And soon, my hearers, you and I shall do the same. I say that now we
          have to look abroad on hosts of enemies. What with the wild beasts of
          Rome, what with the antichrist of Mohammed, what with the thousands of
          idolatries and false gods, what with infidelity in all its myriad
          shapes, many are the enemies of God, and mighty are the hosts of hell.
          Lo, you see them gathered together this day; horseman upon horseman,
          chariot upon chariot, gathered together against the Most High. I see
          the trembling church, fearing to be over-thrown; I mark her leaders
          bending their knees in solemn prayer, and crying, |Lord, save thy
          people, and bless thy heritage.| But mine eye looks through the future
          with telescopic glance, and I see the happy period of the latter days,
          when Christ shall reign triumphant. I shall ask them where is Babel?
          where is Rome? where is Mohammed? and the answer shall come -- where?
          Why they have sunk into the depths; they have sunk to the bottom as a
          stone. Down there the horrid fire devours them, for the sea of glass
          is mingled with the fire of judgment. To-day I see a battle-field; the
          whole earth is torn by the hoofs of horses; there is the rumble of
          cannon and the roll of drum. |To arms! to arms!| both hosts are
          shouting. But you wait awhile, and you shall walk across this plain of
          battle, and say, |Seest thou that colossal system of error dead? There
          lies another, all frozen, in ghastly death, in motionless stupor.
          There lieth infidelity; there sleepeth secularism and the secularist;
          there lie those who defied God. I see all this vast host of rebels
          lying scattered upon the earth. |Sing unto the Lord, for he hath
          triumphed gloriously; Jehovah has gotten unto himself the victory, and
          the last of his enemies are destroyed.| Then shall be the time when
          shall be sung |the song of Moses and of the Lamb.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, turning to the song of Moses, I shall conclude my address to
          you by noticing some interesting particulars in the song which will
          doubtless have a place in the everlasting orchestra of the redeemed,
          when they shall praise the Most High. O! my brethren, I could but wish
          that I had stood by the Red Sea, to have heard that mighty shout, and
          that tremendous roar of acclamation! Methinks one might well have
          borne a servitude in Egypt, to have stood in that mighty host who sung
          such mighty praise. Music hath charms; but never had it such charms as
          it had that day when fair Miriam led the women, and Moses led the men,
          like some mighty leader, beating time with his hand. |Sing unto the
          Lord, for he hath done gloriously.| Methinks I see the scene; and I
          anticipate the greater day, when the song shall be sung again, |as the
          song of Moses and of the Lamb.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, just notice this song. In the 15th chapter of Exodus you find it,
          and in divers of the Psalms you will see it amplified. The first thing
          I would have you notice in it is, that from beginning to end it is a
          praise of God, and of nobody else but God. Moses, thou hast said
          nothing of thyself. O great lawgiver, mightiest of men, did not thine
          hand grasp the mighty rod that split the sea -- that burned its fair
          breast, and left a sear for awhile upon its bosom? Didst not thou lead
          the hosts of Israel? Didst not thou marshal their thousands for
          battle, and like a mighty commander led them through the depths? Is
          there not a word for thee? Not one. The whole strain of the song is,
          |I will sing unto the Lord,| from beginning to end. It is all praise
          of Jehovah; there is not one word about Moses, nor a single word in
          praise of the children of Israel. Dear friends, the last song in this
          world, the song of triumph, shall be full of God, and of no one else.
          Here you praise the instrument; to-day you look on this man and on
          that, and you say, |Thank God for this minister, and for this man?|
          To-day you say, |Blessed be God for Luther, who shook the Vatican, and
          thank God for Whitefield, who stirred up a slumbering church;| but in
          that day you shall not sing of Luther, nor of Whitefield, nor of any
          of the mighty ones of God's hosts; forgotten shall their names be for
          a season, even as the stars refuse to shine when the sun himself
          appeareth. The song shall be unto Jehovah, and Jehovah only; we shall
          not have a word to say for preachers nor bishops, not a syllable to
          say for good men and true; but the whole song from first to last shall
          be, |unto him that loved us and hath washed us from our sins in his
          own blood, unto him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And next will you please to note, that this song celebrated something
          of the fierceness of the enemy! Do you observe how, when the songster
          describes the attack of Pharaoh, he says, |The enemy said, I will
          pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be
          satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy
          them.| A song is made out of the wrath of Pharaoh. And it shall be so
          at the last. The wrath of man shall praise God. I believe the last
          song of the redeemed, when they shall ultimately triumph, will
          celebrate in heavenly stanzas the wrath of man overcome by God.
          Sometimes after great battles, monuments are raised to the memory of
          the fight; and of what are they composed? They are composed of weapons
          of death and of instruments of war which have been taken from the
          enemy. Now, to use that illustration as I think it may be properly
          used, the day is coming when fury, and wrath, and hatred, and strife,
          shall all be woven into a song; and the weapons of our enemies, when
          taken from them, shall serve to make monuments to the praise of God.
          Rail on, rail on, blasphemer! Smite on, smite on, tyrant! Lift thy
          heavy hand, O despot; crush the truth, which yet thou canst not crush;
          knock from his head the crown -- the crown that is far above thy reach
          -- poor puny impotent mortal as thou art! Go on, go on! But all thou
          doest shall but increase his glories. For aught we care, we bid you
          still proceed with all your wrath and malice. Though it shall be worse
          for you, it shall be more glorious for our Master; the greater your
          preparations for war, the more splendid shall be his triumphal
          chariot, when he shall ride through the streets of heaven in pompous
          array. The more mighty your preparations for battle, the more rich the
          spoil which he shall divide with the strong. O! Christian, fear not
          the foe! Remember the harder his blows, the sweeter thy song; the
          greater his wrath, the more splendid thy triumph; the more he rages,
          the more shall Christ be honored in the day of his appearing. They
          sung the song of Moses and the Lamb.

          And then will ye note, in the next place, how they sang the total
          overthrow of the enemy. There is one expression in this song, which
          ought to be and I believe is, when set to music, very frequently
          repeated. It is that part of the song, as recorded in the Psalms,
          where it is declared that the whole host of Pharaoh were utterly
          destroyed, and there was not one of them left. When that great song
          was sung by the side of the Red Sea, there was, no doubt, a special
          emphasis laid upon that expression, |not one.| I think I hear the
          hosts of Israel. When the words were known by them, they began and
          they proceeded thus -- |There is not one of them left;| and then in
          various parts the words were repeated, |Not one, not one.| And then
          the women with their sweet voices sang, |Not one, not one.| I believe
          that at the last, a part of our triumph will be the fact, that there
          is not one left. We shall look abroad throughout the earth, and see it
          all a level sea; and not one foeman pursuing us -- |not one, not one!|
          Raise thyself never so high, O thou deceiver, thou canst not live; for
          not one shall escape. Lift thy head never so proudly, O despot, thou
          canst not live; for not one shall escape. O heir of heaven, not one
          sin shall cross the Jordan after thee; not one shall pass the Red Sea
          to overtake thee; but this shall be the summit of thy triumph -- |Not
          one, not one! not one of them is left.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Just let us note again, and I will not detain you too long, lest I
          weary you. One part of the song of Moses consisted in praising the
          ease with which God destroyed his enemies. |Thou didst blow with thy
          wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters.|
          If we had gone to work to destroy the hosts of Pharaoh, what a
          multitude of engines of death should we have required. If the work had
          been committed to us, to cut off the hosts, what marvelous
          preparations, what thunder, what noise, what great activity there
          would have been. But mark the grandeur of the expression. God did not
          even lift himself from his throne to do it: he saw Pharaoh coming; he
          seemed to look upon him with a placid smile; he did just blow with his
          lips, and the sea covered them. You and I will marvel at the last how
          easy it has been to over-throw the enemies of the Lord.. We have been
          tugging and toiling all our life-time to be the means of overthrowing
          systems of error; it will astonish the church, when her Master shall
          come, to see how, as the ice dissolveth before the fire, all error and
          sin shall be utterly destroyed in the coming of the Most High. We must
          have our societies and our machinery, our preachings and our
          gatherings, and rightly too; but God will not require them at the
          last. The destruction of his enemies shall be as easy to him as the
          making of a world. In passive silence unmoved he sat; and he did but
          break the silence with |Let there be light; and light was.| So shall
          he at the last, when his enemies are raging furiously, blow with his
          winds, and they shall be scattered; they shall melt even as wax, and
          shall be burned like tow; they shall be as the fat of rams; into smoke
          shall they consume, yea, into smoke shall they consume away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, in this song of Moses, you will notice there is one
          peculiar beauty. Moses not only rejoiced for what had been done, but
          for the future consequences of it. He says -- |The people of Canaan,
          whom we are about to attack, will now be seized with sudden fear; by
          the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as a stone.| O! I
          think I hear them singing that too, sweetly and softly -- |as still as
          a stone.| How would the words come full, like gentle thunder heard in
          the distance -- |as still as a stone!| And when we shall get on the
          other side the flood, see the triumph over our enemies, and behold our
          Master reigning, this will form a part of our song, that they must
          henceforth be |as still as a stone.| There will be a hell, but it will
          not be a hell of roaring devils, as it now is. They shall be |as still
          as a stone.| There will be legions of fallen angels, but they shall no
          longer have courage to attack us or defy God: they shall be |as still
          as a stone.| O how grand will that sound, when the hosts of God's
          redeemed, looking down on the demons chained, bound, silenced, struck
          dumb with terror, shall sing exultingly over them! They must be |as
          still as a stone;| and there they must lie, and bite their iron bands.
          The fierce despiser of Christ can no more spit in his face; the proud
          tyrant can no more lift his hands to oppress the saints; even Satan
          can no more attempt to destroy. They shall be |as still as a stone.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And last of all, the song concludes by noticing the eternity of God's
          reign; and this will always make a part of the triumphant song. They
          sang, |The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.| Then I can suppose the
          whole band broke out into their loudest strain of music. |The Lord
          shall reign for ever and ever.| Part of the melody of heaven will be
          -- |The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.| That song has cheered us
          here -- |The Lord reigneth; blessed be my Rock!| And that song shall
          be oar exultation there. |The Lord reigneth for ever and ever.| When
          we shall see the placid sea of providence, when we shall behold the
          world all fair and lovely, when we shall mark our enemies destroyed,
          and God Almighty triumphant, then we shall shout the song --
        </p>
        <p>|Hallelujah! for the Lord</p>
        <p>God Omnipotent shall reign;</p>
        <p>Hallelujah! let the word</p>
        <p>Echo round the earth and main.|</p>
        <p>O! may we be there to sing it!</p>
        <p>
          I have one remark to make, and I have done. You know, my friends, that
          as there is something in the song of Moses which is typical of the
          song of the Lamb, there was another song sung by the waters of the Red
          Sea which is typical of the song of hell. |What mean you, sir, by that
          dread thought?| O! shall I use the word music? Shall I profane the
          heavenly word so much as to say, It was doleful music which came from
          the lips of Pharaoh and his host? Boldly and pompously, with roll of
          drum and blast of trumpet they had entered into the sea. On a sudden
          their martial music ceased ; and ah! ye heavens and ye floods what was
          it? The sea was coming down upon them, utterly to devour them. O! may
          we never hear that shriek, that awful yell of hideous agony, that
          seemed to rend the sky, and then was hushed again, when Pharaoh and
          his mighty men were swallowed up, and went down quick into hell! Ah!
          stars, if ye had heard it, if the black pall of waters had not shut
          out the sound from you, ye might have continued trembling unto this
          hour, and mayhap ye are trembling now; mayhap your twinklings by night
          are on account of that terrible shriek ye heard; for sure it were
          enough to make you tremble on for ever. That dreadful shriek, that
          hideous moan, that horrible howl, when a whole army sank into hell at
          once when the waters swallowed them up!
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed, my friends, take heed, lest you should have to join in that
          terrible miserere; take heed, less that horrible howl should be yours,
          instead of the song of the redeemed. And remember, so must it be,
          unless ye be born again, unless ye believe in Christ, unless ye repent
          of sin and renounce it wholly, and with trembling hearts put your
          confidence in the man of sorrows, who is soon to be crowned the King
          of kings and Lord of lords. May God bless you, and give you all to
          taste of his salvation, that you may stand upon the sea of glass, and
          not have to feel the terrors of the mingled fire in the lower depths
          thereof! God Almighty bless this vast assembly, for Jesus' sake.
