        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.73)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 30, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said
          unto him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to-day I must abide
          at thy house.| -- Luke 19:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding our firm belief that you are in the main well
          instructed in the doctrines of the everlasting gospel, we are
          continually reminded in our conversation with young converts, how
          absolutely necessary it is to repeat our former lessons, and
          repeatedly assert and prove over and over again those doctrines which
          lie at the basis of our holy religion. Our friends, therefore, who
          have many years ago been taught the great doctrine of effectual
          calling, will believe that whilst I preach very simply this morning,
          the sermon is intended for those who are young in the fear of the
          Lord, that they may better understand this great starting point of God
          in the heart, the effectual calling of men by the Holy Spirit. I shall
          use the case of Zaccheus as a great illustration of the doctrine of
          effectual calling. You will remember the story. Zaccheus had a
          curiosity to see the wonderful man Jesus Christ, who was turning the
          world upside down, and causing an immense excitement in the minds of
          men. We sometimes find fault with curiosity, and say it is sinful to
          come to the house of God from that motive; I am not quite sure that we
          should hazard such an assertion. The motive is not sinful, though
          certainly it is not virtuous; yet it has often been proved that
          curiosity is one of the best allies of grace. Zaccheus, moved by this
          motive, desired to see Christ; but there were two obstacles in the
          way: first, there was such a crowd of people that he could not get
          near the Saviour; and again, he was so exceedingly short in stature
          that there was no hope of his reaching over people's heads to catch a
          glimpse of him. What did he do? He did as the boys were doing -- for
          the boys of old times were no doubt just like the boys of the present
          age, and were perched up in the boughs of the tree to look at Jesus as
          he passed along. Elderly man though he is, Zaccheus jumps up, and
          there he sits among the children. The boys are too much afraid of that
          stern old publican, whom their fathers dreaded, to push him down or
          cause him any inconvenience. See him there. With what anxiety he is
          peeping down to see which is Christ -- for the Saviour had no pompous
          distinction; no beadle is walking before him with a silver mace; he
          did not hold a golden crozier in his hand: he had no pontifical dress;
          in fact, he was just dressed like those around him. He had a coat like
          that of a common peasant, made of one piece from top to bottom; and
          Zaccheus could scarcely distinguish him. However, before he has caught
          a sight of Christ, Christ has fixed his eye upon him, and standing
          under the tree, he looks up, and says, |Zaccheus, make haste, and come
          down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.| Down comes Zaccheus;
          Christ goes to his house; Zaccheus becomes Christ's follower, and
          enters into the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Now, first, effectual calling is a very gracious truth. You may
          guess this from the fact that Zaccheus was a character whom we should
          suppose the last to be saved. He belonged to a bad city -- Jericho --
          a city which had been cursed, and no one would suspect that any one
          would come out of Jericho to be saved. It was near Jericho that the
          man fell among thieves; we trust Zaccheus had no hand in it; but there
          are some who, while they are publicans, can be thieves also. We might
          as well expect converts from St. Giles's, or the lowest parts of
          London, from the worst and vilest dens of infamy, as from Jericho in
          those days. Ah! my brethren, it matters not where you come from; you
          may come from one of the dirtiest streets, one of the worst back slums
          in London but if effectual grace call you, it is an effectual call,
          which knoweth no distinction of place. Zaccheus also was of an
          exceedingly bad trade, and probably cheated the people in order to
          enrich himself. Indeed, when Christ went into his house, there was an
          universal murmur that he had gone to be a guest with a man that was a
          sinner. But, my brethren, grace knows no distinction; it is no
          respector of persons, but God calleth whom he wills, and he called
          this worst of publicans, in the worst of cities, from the worst of
          trades. Besides, Zaccheus was one who was the least likely to be saved
          because he was rich. It is true, rich and poor are welcome; no one has
          the least excuse for despair because of his condition; yet it is a
          fact that |not many great men,| after the flesh, |not many mighty,|
          are called, but |God hath chosen the poor of this world -- rich in
          faith.| But grace knows no distinction here. The rich Zaccheus is
          called from the tree; down he comes, and he is saved. I have thought
          it one of the greatest instances of God's condescension that he can
          look down on man; but I will tell you there was a greater
          condescension than that, when Christ looked up to see Zaccheus. For
          God to look down on his creatures -- that is mercy; but for Christ so
          to humble himself that he has to look up to one of his own creatures,
          that becomes mercy indeed. Ah! many of you have climbed up the tree of
          your own good works, and perched yourselves in the branches of your
          holy actions, and are trusting in the free will of the poor creature,
          or resting in some worldly maxim; nevertheless, Christ looks up even
          to proud sinners, and calls them down. |Come down,| says he, |to-day I
          must abide in thy house.| Had Zaccheus been a humble-minded man,
          sitting by the wayside, or at the feet of Christ, we should then have
          admired Christ's mercy; but here he is lifted up, and Christ looks up
          to him, and bids him come down.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next it was a personal call. There were boys in the tree as well as
          Zaccheus but there was no mistake about the person who was called. It
          was, |Zaccheus, make haste and come down.| There are other calls
          mentioned in Scripture. It is said, especially, |Many are called, but
          few are chosen.| Now that is not the effectual call which is intended
          by the apostle, when he said, |Whom he called, them he also
          justified.| That is a general call which many men, yea, all men
          reject, unless there come after it the personal, particular call,
          which makes us Christians. You will bear me witness that it was a
          personal call that brought you to the Saviour. It was some sermon
          which led you to feel that you were, no doubt, the person intended.
          The text, perhaps, was |Thou, God, seest me;| and the minister laid
          particular stress on the word |me,| so that you thought God's eye was
          fixed upon you; and ere the sermon was concluded, you thought you saw
          God open the books to condemn you, and your heart whispered, |Can any
          hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the
          Lord.| You might have been perched in the window, or stood packed in
          the aisle; but you had a solemn conviction that the sermon was
          preached to you, and not to other people. God does not call his people
          in shoals, but in units. |Jesus saith unto her, Mary; and she turned
          and said unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.| Jesus seeth
          Peter and John fishing by the lake, and he saith unto them, |Follow
          me.| He seeth Matthew sitting at the table at the receipt of custom,
          and he saith unto him, |Arise, and follow me,| and Matthew did so.
          When the Holy Ghost comes home to a man, God's arrow goes into his
          heart: it does not graze his helmet, or make some little mark upon his
          armour, but it penetrates between the joints of the harness, entering
          the marrow of the soul. Have you felt, dear friends, that personal
          call? Do you remember when a voice said, |Arise, he calleth thee.| Can
          you look back to some time when you said, |My Lord, my God?| when you
          knew the Spirit was striving with you, and you said, Lord, I come to
          thee, for I know that thou callest me.| I might call the whole of you
          throughout eternity, but if God call one, there will be more effect
          through his personal call of one than my general call of multitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Thirdly, it is a hastening call. |Zaccheus, make haste.| The
          sinner, when he is called by the ordinary ministry, replies,
          |To-morrow.| He hears a telling sermon, and he said, |I will turn to
          God by-and-bye.| The tears roll down his cheek, but they are wiped
          away. Some goodness appears, but like the cloud of the morning it is
          dissipated by the sun of temptation. He says, |I solemnly vow from
          this time to be a reformed man. After I have once more indulged in my
          darling sin, I will renounce my lusts, and decide for God.| Ah! that
          is only a minister's call, and is good for nothing. Hell, they say, is
          paved with good intentions. These good intentions are begotten by
          general calls. The road to perdition is laid all over with branches of
          trees whereon men are sitting, for they often pull down branches from
          the trees but they do not come down themselves. The straw laid down
          before a sick man's door causes the wheels to roll more noiselessly.
          So there be some who strew their path with promises of repentance, and
          so go more easily and noiselessly down to perdition. But God's call is
          not a call for to-morrow. |To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden
          not your hearts: as in the provocation, when your fathers tempted me.|
          God's grace always comes with despatch; and if thou art drawn by God,
          thou wilt run after God, and not be talking about delays. To-morrow --
          it is not written in the almanack of time. To-morrow -- it is in
          Satan's calendar, and nowhere else. To-morrow -- it is a rock whitened
          by the bones of mariners who have been wrecked upon it; it is the
          wrecker's light gleaming on the shore, luring poor ships to
          destruction. To-morrow -- it is the idiot's cup which he fableth to
          lie at the foot of the rainbow, but which none hath ever found.
          To-morrow -- it is the floating island of Loch Lomond, which none hath
          ever seen. To-morrow -- it is a dream. To-morrow -- it is a delusion.
          To-morrow, ay, to-morrow you may lift up your eyes in hell, being in
          torments. Yonder clock saith |to-day;| everything crieth |to-day;| and
          the Holy Ghost is in union with these things, and saith, |To-day if ye
          will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.| Sinners, are you
          inclined now to seek the Saviour? are you breathing a prayer now? are
          you saying, |Now or never! I must be saved now?| If you are, then I
          hope it is an effectual call, for Christ, when he giveth an effectual
          call, says, |Zaccheus, make haste.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Next, it is a humbling call. |Zaccheus, make haste and come down.|
          Many a time hath a minister called men to repentance with a call which
          has made them proud, exalted them in their own esteem, and led them to
          say, |I can turn to God when I like; I can do so without the influence
          of the Holy Ghost.| They have been called to go up and not to come
          down. God always humbles a sinner. Can I not remember when Gold told
          me to come down? One of the first steps I had to take was to go right
          down from my good works; and oh! what a fall was that! I have pulled
          you down from your good works, and now I will pull you down from your
          self-sufficiency.| Well, I had another fall, and I felt sure I had
          gained the bottom, but Christ said |Come down!| and he made me come
          down till I fell on some point at which I felt I was yet salvable.
          |Down, sir! come down, yet.| And down I came until I had to let go
          every bough of the tree of my hopes in despair: and then I said, |I
          can do nothing; I am ruined.| The waters were wrapped round my head,
          and I was shut out from the light of day, and thought myself a
          stranger from the commonwealth of Israel. |Come down lower yet, sir!
          thou hast too much pride to be saved. Then I was brought down to see
          my corruption, my wickedness, my filthiness. |Come down,| says God,
          when he means to save. Now, proud sinners, it is of no use for you to
          be proud, to stick yourselves up in the trees; Christ will have you
          down. Oh, thou that dwellest with the eagle on the craggy rock, thou
          shalt come down from thy elevation; thou shalt fall by grace, or thou
          shalt fall with a vengeance one day. He |hath cast down the mighty
          from their seat, and hath exalted the humble and meek.|
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Next, it is an affectionate call. |To-day I must abide in thy
          house.| You can easily conceive how the faces of the multitude change!
          They thought Christ to be the holiest and best of men, and were ready
          to make him a king. But he says, |To-day I must abide in thy house.|
          There was one poor Jew who had been inside Zaccheus's house; he had
          |been on the carpet,| as they say in country villages when they are
          taken before the justice, and he recollected what sort of house it
          was; he remembered how he was taken in there, and his conceptions of
          it were something like what a fly would have of a spider's den after
          he had once escaped. There was another who had been distrained of
          nearly all his property; and the idea he had of walking in there was
          like walking into the den of lions. |What!| said they, |Is this holy
          man going into such a den as that, where we poor wretches have been
          robbed and ill-treated. It was bad enough for Christ to speak to him
          up in the tree, but the idea of going into his house!| They all
          murmured at his going to be |a guest with a man who was a sinner.|
          Well, I know what some of his disciples thought: they thought it very
          imprudent; it might injure his character, and he might offend the
          people. They thought he might have gone to see this man night, like
          Nicodemus, and give him an audience when nobody saw him; but publicly
          to acknowledge such a man was the most imprudent act he could commit.
          But why did Christ do as he did? Because he would give Zaccheus an
          affectionate call. |I will not come and stand at thy threshold, or
          look in at thy window, but I will come into thine house -- the same
          house where the cries of widows have come into thine ears, and thou
          hast disregarded them; I will come into thy parlour, where the weeping
          of the orphan have never moved thy compassion; I will come there,
          where thou, like a ravenous lion hast devoured thy prey; I will come
          there, where thou hast blackened thine house, and made it infamous; I
          will come into the place where cries have risen to high heaven, wrung
          from the lips of those whom thou hast oppressed; I will come into thy
          house and give thee a blessing.| Oh! what affection there was in that!
          Poor sinner, my Master is a very affectionate Master. He will come
          into your house. What kind of a house have you got? A house that you
          have made miserable with your drunkenness -- a house that you have
          defiled with your impurity -- a house you have defiled with your
          cursing and swearing -- a house where you are carrying on an ill-trade
          that you would be glad to get rid of. Christ say, |I will come into
          thine house.| And I know some houses now that once were dens of sin,
          where Christ comes every morning; the husband and wife who once could
          quarrel and fight, bend their knees together in prayer. Some of my
          hearers can scarce come for an hour to their meals but they must have
          a word of prayer and reading of the Scriptures. Christ comes to them.
          Where the walls were plastered up with the lascivious song and idle
          picture, there is a Christian almanack in one place, there is a Bible
          on the chest of drawers; and though it is only one room they live in,
          if an angel should come in, and God should say, |What hast thou seen
          in that house?| he would say, |I have seen good furniture, for there
          is a Bible there; here and there a religious book; the filthy pictures
          are pulled down and burned; there are no cards in the man's cupboard
          now; Christ has come into his house.| Oh! what a blessing that we have
          our household God as well as the Romans! Our God is a household God.
          He comes to live with his people; he loves the tents of Jacob. Now,
          poor ragmuffin sinner, thou who livest in the filthiest den in London,
          if such an one be here, Jesus saith to thee, |Zaccheus, make haste and
          come down; for to-day I must abide in thy house.|
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Again, it was not only an affectionate call, but it was an abiding
          call. |To-day I must abide at thy house.| A common call is like this:
          |To-day I shall walk in at thy house at one door, and out at the
          other.| The common call which is given by the gospel to all men is a
          call which operates upon them for a time, and then it is all over; but
          the saving call is an abiding call. When Christ speaks, he does not
          say, |Make haste, Zaccheus, and come down, for I am just coming to
          look in;| but |I must abide in thy house; I am coming to sit down to
          eat and drink with thee; I am coming to have a meal with thee; to-day
          I must abide in thy house.| |Ah!| says one, |you cannot tell how many
          times I have been impressed, sir, I have often had a series of solemn
          convictions, and I thought I really was saved, but it all died away;
          like a dream, when one awaketh, all hath vanished that he dreamed, so
          was it with me.| Ah! but poor soul, do not despair. Dost thou feel the
          strivings of Almighty grace within thine heart bidding thee repent
          to-day? If thou dost, it will be an abiding call. If it is Jesus at
          work in thy soul, he will come and tarry in thine heart, and
          consecrate thee for his own for ever. He says, |I will come and dwell
          with thee, and that for ever. I will come and say,
        </p>
        <p>Here I will make my settled rest,</p>
        <p>No more will go and come;</p>
        <p>No more a stranger or a guest,</p>
        <p>But master of this home.|</p>
        <p>
          |Oh!| say you, |that is what I want; I wan an abiding call, something
          that will last; I do not want a religion that will wash out, but a
          fast-colour religion.| Well, that is the kind of call Christ gives.
          His ministers cannot give it; but when Christ speaks, he speaks with
          power, and says, |Zaccheus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I
          must abide at thy house.|
        </p>
        <p>
          7. There is one thing, however, I cannot forget, and that is that it
          was a necessary call. Just read it over again. |Zaccheus, make haste,
          and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.| It was not a
          thing that he might do, or might not do; but it was a necessary call.
          The salvation of a sinner is as much a matter of necessity with God as
          the fulfilment of his covenant that the rain shall no more drown the
          world. The salvation of every blood-bought child of God is a necessary
          thing for three reasons; it is necessary because it is God's purpose;
          it is necessary because it is Christ's purchase; it is necessary
          because it is God's promise. It is necessary that the child of God
          should be saved. Some divines think it is very wrong to lay a stress
          on the word |must,| especially in that passage where it is said |he
          must needs go through Samaria.| |Why,| they say, |he must needs go
          through Samaria, because there was no other way he could go, and
          therefore he was forced to go that way.| Yes, gentlemen, we reply, no
          doubt; but then there might have been another way. Providence made it
          so that he must needs go through Samaria, and that Samaria should like
          in the route he had chosen. So that we have you any way. |He must
          needs go through Samaria.| Providence directed man to build Samaria
          directly in the road, and grace constrained the Saviour to move in
          that direction. It was not |Come down, Zaccheus, because I may abide
          at thy house,| but |I must.| The Saviour felt a strong necessity. Just
          as much a necessity as there is that man should die, as stern a
          necessity as there is that the sun should give us light by day and the
          moon by night, just so much a necessity is there that every
          blood-bought child of God shall be saved. |To-day I must abide at thy
          house.| And oh! when the Lord comes to this, that he must and he will,
          what a thing it is with the poor sinner then! At other times we ask,
          |Shall I let him in at all? there is a stranger at the door; he is
          knocking now; he has knocked before; shall I let him in?| But this
          time it is, |I must abide at thy house.| There was no knocking at the
          door, but smash went the door into atoms! and in he walked: |I must, I
          shall, I will; I care not for your protesting your vileness, your
          unbelief; I must, I will; I must abide in thy house.| |Ah!| says one,
          |I do not believe God would ever make me to believe as you believe, or
          become a Christian at all.| Ah! but if he shall but say, |To-day I
          must abide at thy house,| there will be no resistance in you. There
          are some of you who would scorn the very idea of being a canting
          methodist; |What, sir! do you suppose I would ever turn one of your
          religious people?| No, my friend, I don't suppose it; I know it for a
          certainty. If God says |I must,| there is no standing against it. Let
          him say |must,| and it must be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will just tell you an anecdote proving this. |A father was about
          sending his son to college; but as he knew the influence to which he
          would be exposed, he was not without a deep and anxious solicitude for
          the spiritual and eternal welfare of his favourite child. Fearing lest
          the principles of Christian faith, which he had endeavoured to instil
          into his mind, would be rudely assailed, but trusting in the efficacy
          of that word which is quick and powerful, he purchased, unknown to his
          son, an elegant copy of the Bible, and deposited it at the bottom of
          his trunk. The young man entered upon his college career. The
          restraints of a pious education were son broken off, and he proceeded
          from speculation to doubts, and from doubts to a denial of the reality
          of religion. After having become, in his own estimation, wiser than
          his father, he discovered one day, while rummaging his trunk, with
          great surprise and indignation, the sacred deposit. He took it out,
          and while deliberating on the manner in which he should treat it, he
          determined that he would use it as waste paper, on which to wipe his
          razor while shaving. Accordingly, every time he went to shave, he tore
          a leaf or two of the holy book, and thus used it til nearly half the
          volume was destroyed. But while he was committing this outrage upon
          the sacred book, a text now and then met his eye, and was carried like
          a barbed arrow to his heart. At length, he heard a sermon, which
          discovered to him his own character, and his exposure to the wrath of
          God, and riveted upon his mind the impression which he has received
          from the last torn leaf of the blessed, yet insulted volume. Had
          worlds been at his disposal, he would freely have given them all,
          could they have availed, in enabling him to undo what he had done. At
          length he found forgiveness at the foot of the cross. The torn leaves
          of that sacred volume brought healing to his soul; for they led him to
          repose on the mercy of God, which is sufficient for the chief of
          sinners.| I tell you there is not a reprobate walking the streets and
          defiling the air with his blasphemies, there is not a creature
          abandoned so as to be well-nigh as bad as Satan himself, if he is a
          child of life, who is not within the reach of mercy. And if God says,
          |To-day I must abide in thy house,| he then assuredly will. Do you
          feel, my dear hearer, just now, something in your mind which seems to
          say you have held out against the gospel a long while, but to-day you
          can hold out no longer? Do you feel that a strong hand has god hold of
          you, and do you hear a voice saying, |Sinner, I must abide in thy
          house; you have often scorned me, you have often laughed at me, you
          have often spit in the face of mercy, often blasphemed me, but sinner,
          I must abide in thy house; you banged the door yesterday in the
          missionary's face, you burned the tract, you laughed at the minister,
          you have cursed God's house, you have violated the Sabbath; but,
          sinner, I must abide in thy house, and I will!| |What, Lord!| you say,
          |abide in my house! why it is covered all over with iniquity. Abide in
          my house! why there is not a chair or a table but would cry out
          against me. Abide in my house! why the joists and beams and flooring
          would all rise up and tell thee that I am not worthy to kiss the hem
          of thy garment. What, Lord! abide in my house!| |Yes,| says he, |I
          must; there is a strong necessity; my powerful love constrains me, and
          whether thou wilt let me or no, I am determined to make thee willing,
          and thou shalt let me in.| Does not this surprise you, that Christ not
          only asks you to come to him, but invites himself to your table, and
          what is more, when you would put him away, kindly says, |I must, I
          will come in.| Only think of Christ going after a sinner, crying after
          a sinner, beginning a sinner to let him save him; and that is just
          what Jesus does to his chosen ones. The sinner runs away from him, but
          free-grace pursues him, and says, |Sinner, come to Christ;| and if our
          hearts be shut up, Christ puts his hand in at the door, and if we do
          not rise, but repulse him coldly, he says, |I must, I will come in;|
          he weeps over us till his tears win us; he cries after us till his
          cries prevail; and at last in his own well determined hour he enters
          into our heart, and there he dwells. |I must abide in thy house,| said
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. And now, lastly, this call was an effectual one, for we see the
          fruits it brought forth. Open was Zaccheus's door; spread was his
          table; generous was his heart; washed were his hands; unburdened was
          his conscience; joyful was his soul. |Here, Lord,| says he, |the half
          of my goods I give to the poor; I dare say I have robbed them of half
          my property -- and now I restore it.| |And if I have taken anything
          from any one by false accusation, I will restore it to him fourfold.|
          -- away goes another portion of his property. Ah! Zaccheus, you will
          go to be to-night a great deal poorer than when you got up this
          morning -- but infinitely richer, too -- poor, very poor, in this
          world's goods, compared with what thou wert when thou first didst
          climb that sycamore tree; but richer-infinitely richer -- in heavenly
          treasure. Sinner, we shall know whether God calls you by this: if he
          calls, it will be an effectual call -- not a call which you hear and
          then forget but one which produces good works. If God hath called thee
          this morning, down will go that drunken cup, up will go thy prayers;
          if God hath called thee this morning, there will not be one shutter up
          to-day in your shop, but all, and you will have a notice stuck up,
          |This house is closed on the Sabbath day, and will not again on that
          day, be opened.| To-morrow, there will be such-and-such worldly
          amusement, but if God hath called you, you will not go. And if you
          have robbed anybody (and who knows but I may have a thief here?) If
          God call you, there will be a restoration of what you have stolen? you
          will give up all that you have, so that you will follow God with all
          your heart. We do not believe a man to be converted unless he doth
          renounce the error of his ways; unless, practically, he is brought to
          know that Christ himself is master of his conscience, and his law is
          his delight. |Zaccheus, make haste and come down, I must abide at thy
          house.| And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
          |And Zaccheus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of
          my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man
          by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him,
          This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a
          son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
          which was lost.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, one or two lessons. A lesson to the proud. Come down, proud
          hearts, come down! Mercy runneth in valleys, but it goeth not to the
          mountain top. Come down, come down, lofty spirit! The lofty city, he
          layeth it low even to the ground, and then he buildeth it up. Again, a
          lesson to thee, poor despairing soul: I am glad to see thee in God's
          house this morning; it is a good sign. I care not what you came for.
          You heard there was a strange kind of man that preached here, perhaps.
          Never mind about that. You are all quite as strange as he is. It is
          necessary that there should be strange men to gather in other strange
          men. Now, I have a mass of people here; and if I might use a figure, I
          should compare you to a great heap of ashes, mingled with which are a
          few steel filings. Now, my sermon if it be attended with divine grace,
          will be a sort of magnet: it will not attract any of the ashes -- they
          will keep just where they are -- but it will draw out the steel
          filings. I have got a Zaccheus there; there is a Mary up there, a John
          down there, a Sarah, or a William, or a Thomas, there -- God's chosen
          ones -- they are steel filings in the congregation of ashes, and my
          gospel, the gospel of the blessed God, like a great magnet, draws them
          out of the heap. There they come, there they come. Why? because there
          was a magnetic power between the gospel and their hearts. AH! poor
          sinner, come to Jesus, believe his love, trust his mercy. If thou hast
          a desire to come, if thou art forcing thy way through the ashes to get
          to Christ, then it is because Christ is calling thee. Oh! all of you
          who know yourselves to be sinners -- every man, woman, and child of
          you -- yea, ye little children (for God has given me some of you to be
          my wages), do you feel yourselves sinners? then believe on Jesus and
          be saved. You have come here from curiosity, many of you. Oh! that you
          might be met with and saved. I am distressed for you lest you should
          sink into hell-fire. Oh! listen to Christ while he speaks to you.
          Christ says, |Come down,| this morning. Go home and humble yourselves
          in the sight of God: go and confess your iniquities that you have
          sinned against him; go home and tell him that you are a wretch, undone
          without his sovereign grace; and then look to him, for rest assured he
          has first looked to you. You say, |Sir, oh! I am willing enough to be
          saved, but I am afraid he is not willing.| Stay! stay! no more of
          that! Do you know that is part blasphemy -- not quite. If you were not
          ignorant, I would tell you that it was part blasphemy. You cannot look
          to Christ before he has looked to you. If you are willing to be saved,
          he gave you that will. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and be
          baptized, and thou shalt be saved. I trust the Holy Spirit is calling
          you. Young man up there, young man in the window, make haste! come
          down! Old man, sitting in these pews, come down. Merchant in yonder
          aisle, make haste. Matron and youth, not knowing Christ, oh, may he
          look at you. Old grandmother, hear the gracious call; and thou, young
          lad, Christ may be looking at thee -- I trust he is -- and saying to
          thee, |Make haste, and come down, for to-day I must abide at thy
          house.|
