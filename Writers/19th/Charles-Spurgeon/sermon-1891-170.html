          1. Since, again, some who are reckoned among the orthodox go beyond
          the pre-arranged plan for the exaltation of the just, and are ignorant
          of the methods by which they are disciplined beforehand for
          incorruption, they thus entertain heretical opinions. For the
          heretics, despising the handiwork of God, and not admitting the
          salvation of their flesh, while they also treat the promise of God
          contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments they
          form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above
          the heavens and the Demiurge, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to
          that Father whom they have feigned. Those persons, therefore, who
          disallow a resurrection affecting the whole man (universam reprobant
          resurrectionem), and as far as in them lies remove it from the midst
          [of the Christian scheme], how can they be wondered at, if again they
          know nothing as to the plan of the resurrection? For they do not
          choose to understand, that if these things are as they say, the Lord
          Himself, in whom they profess to believe, did not rise again upon the
          third day; but immediately upon His expiring on the cross, undoubtedly
          departed on high, leaving His body to the earth. But the case was,
          that for three days He dwelt in the place where the dead were, as the
          prophet says concerning Him: |And the Lord remembered His dead saints
          who slept formerly in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them,
          to rescue and save them.| And the Lord Himself says, |As Jonas
          remained three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall
          the Son of man be in the heart of the earth.| Then also the apostle
          says, |But when He ascended, what is it but that He also descended
          into the lower parts of the earth?| This, too, David says when
          prophesying of Him, |And thou hast delivered my soul from the
          nethermost hell;| and on His rising again the third day, He said to
          Mary, who was the first to see and to worship Him, |Touch Me not, for
          I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to the disciples, and
          say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and unto your Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If, then, the Lord observed the law of the dead, that He might
          become the first-begotten from the dead, and tarried until the third
          day |in the lower parts of the earth;| then afterwards rising in the
          flesh, so that He even showed the print of the nails to His disciples,
          He thus ascended to the Father; -- [if all these things occurred, I
          say], how must these men not be put to confusion, who allege that |the
          lower parts| refer to this world of ours, but that their inner man,
          leaving the body here, ascends into the super-celestial place? For as
          the Lord |went away in the midst of the shadow of death,| where the
          souls of the dead were, yet afterwards arose in the body, and after
          the resurrection was taken up [into heaven], it is manifest that the
          souls of His disciples also, upon whose account the Lord underwent
          these things, shall go away into the invisible place allotted to them
          by God, and there remain until the resurrection, awaiting that event;
          then receiving their bodies, and rising in their entirety, that is
          bodily, just as the Lord arose, they shall come thus into the presence
          of God. |For no disciple is above the Master, but every one that is
          perfect shall be as his Master.| As our Master, therefore, did not at
          once depart, taking flight [to heaven], but awaited the time of His
          resurrection prescribed by the Father, which had been also shown forth
          through Jonas, and rising again after three days was taken up [to
          heaven]; so ought we also to await the time of our resurrection
          prescribed by God and foretold by the prophets, and so, rising, be
          taken up, as many as the Lord shall account worthy of this
          [privilege]. <br />
