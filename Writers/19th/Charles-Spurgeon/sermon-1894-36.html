Thy glory, O Israel,<br/>Is slain upon thy high places!<br/>How are the mighty -- <br/>Fallen!</p><p> Tell it not in Gath,<br/>Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;<br/>Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,<br/>Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p><p> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Neither fields of offerings:<br/>For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, as of one not anointed with oil.</p><p> From the blood of the slain,<br/>From the fat of the mighty,<br/>The bow of Jonathan turned not back,<br/>And the sword of Saul returned not empty.<br/>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided;<br/>They were swifter than eagles,<br/>They were stronger than lions.</p><p> Ye daughters of Israel,<br/>Weep over Saul,<br/>Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,<br/>Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p><p> How are the mighty -- <br/>Fallen in the midst of the battle!<br/>O Jonathan,<br/>Slain upon thy high places,</p><p> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:<br/>Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:<br/>Thy love to me was wonderful,<br/>Passing the love of women.</p><p> How are the mighty -- <br/>Fallen!<br/>And the weapons of war -- <br/>Perished!</p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
