          |Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will
          heal us; he hath smitten and he will bind us up. After two days he
          will revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall
          live in his sight.| -- Hosea 6:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          TENDER FATHERS seek first to will their children by gentle means. The
          Lord, in his long-suffering, dealt very kindly with his erring Israel,
          sending them favor after favor, and blessing after blessing, saying by
          his acts, |I have given them their corn, and their wine, and their
          oil, they will surely turn unto me and say, Our Father, thou shalt be
          the guide of our youth.' But the more he multiplied his bounties, the
          more they multiplied their iniquities, and they burned sacrifice unto
          the gods of Edom, and of Moab, even to those that were no gods,
          saying, |These be thy gods, O Israel, which have given unto thee thy
          corn, and thy wine, and thy oil;| so they spent the mercies of God in
          sacrifice upon their idols, and committed transgressions with the
          false gods of the heathen, consuming upon their lusts the very mercies
          which God had sent to bring them to repentance. When at last God saw
          that this measure did not move them, because their sin was written as
          with an iron pen, and graven upon the very horns of their altars, then
          he tried harsher means; he hewed them by the prophets; they rose early
          and they prophesied until the going down of the sun, giving line upon
          line, precept upon precept, threatening them with the anger and
          vengeance of God. At last that vengeance came; he carried them away
          captive, and they went into a land that they knew not, among a cruel
          people, whose speech they could not understand. Again he delivered
          them out of the hand of their enemy; and yet, again, because of their
          sin, he sold them to Assyria, and afterwards to Babylon, that at last,
          after they had been rent and torn, they might say within themselves,
          |Come, and let us return unto the Lord.| Now, my brethren, the people
          of Israel are but a picture of ourselves; especially are they
          representatives of a certain class, some of whom are now present. God
          has tried you with mercy upon mercy; kept you long in health, till you
          scarce ever had a day's sickness; given you all that you could wish,
          till your cup was brimming and flowing over; but you used his mercies
          for your own self-indulgence, and the bodily strength which was given
          you to be a blessing you have made a curse. Streams of mercy never
          ceasing God has vouchsafed to you, but your only return has been
          stream of sin, broad, and black, and deep. And now to-day he has been
          changing his ways with you. I am speaking to some whom God has of late
          heavily afflicted; seeing gentler means would not do, he has turned
          your wine into wormwood, and your honey into gall; he has made you
          sick in body and dispirited in mind; your earthly goods are melting
          like snow before the summer's sun; your children die before your very
          eyes, and the desire of your heart is taken away with a stroke. God
          has made all his waves and his billows go over you; the law has
          sounded ids trumpet in your ear and brought your sin to remembrance;
          conscience has started up in alarm from its long sleep and cries like
          a mighty man that waketh up from his slumber and finds the camp
          besieged. You are troubled and sore broken; your heart is melted like
          wax in the midst of your bowels, so that while you are sitting in the
          house of God to-day you are complaining. -- |I am the man that has
          seen affliction;| and perhaps worse thank that you are groaning, |His
          wrath lieth hard upon me, I cannot look up.| It is to you I am about
          to speak this morning. I single you out from the crowd, and yet I
          trust while I address you there may be also some words of comfort or
          of instruction for the rest of the congregation. Oh! may you, nay
          hearer, you upon whom I fix my eye this morning, you whose case is the
          case of Israel in Hosea, may you say, |Come, and let us return unto
          the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and
          he will bind us up.| I desire to come straight up to you who are in
          this condition and put my hand inside yours, holding you fast while I
          strive in God's name to reason with you, beseeching God the Holy
          Spirit to reason better than I can, sweetly moving your soul, till you
          say, |I will arise and go unto my Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Three things I must do this morning; first, I must deal a blow, at the
          old Tempter, who has got the first hand at you; secondly, I will come
          to reason comfortably with you; and then, thirdly, I must lovingly
          persuade you, saying -- |Come, let us return unto the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First then, I must DEAL A BLOW AT THE OLD TEMPTER, WHO HAS GOT
          BEFORE ME AND HAS BEGUN TO DECEIVE YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot tell what is the precise temptation that Satan has been using
          with you, but I think it is very likely to be one of four.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first one has been this -- |Oh,| saith he, |see how troubled you
          are, nothing prospers with you; what pains of body you suffer, and how
          depressed you are in spirit. God is a tyrant to you, he treats you
          cruelly; hate him, set your teeth together and curse him; say no, if
          he treats me thus he is not a God that I can love, I will abhor him
          from my very soul.| I have uttered that temptation in startling
          language because such dark insinuations as this have been very common
          with much tried and troubled men. I remember many who, in telling
          their experience of how they were brought to Christ, have confessed
          that when first the hammer of God's law fell upon their hearts it
          hardened them, when God smote, they were like the bullock which kicks
          against the pricks of the ox-goad; they felt like a high blooded,
          unbroken horse, the bit was in their mouths, but they pulled and
          tugged at it, and the more it cut and wounded them the more resolved
          they were that they would not turn, in fact, hatred was stirred up
          against God by what was intended to bring them to his feet. Soul, doth
          Satan tempt thee thus? Then indeed it is a sad proof that sin is
          madness. I can only compare thy case to you poor maniac, who has
          labored hard to destroy himself by existing himself into the fire or
          into the water. Some kind person, willing to bear all the
          inconveniences of such an office, has volunteered to be his keeper.
          See, the man is dashing to the water's brink and means to throw
          himself into the stream, his keeper holds him back, and with stern
          words and sterner acts throws him down upon the ground, and binds him
          so that he cannot take the fatal leap. But look again, he longs to
          burn himself, he makes a tremendous effort to thrust his body into the
          flame, but his keeper shuts him up in a room where he cannot get at
          the devouring flame. All the |while this madman hates him, curses him,
          spits upon him, and would do anything if he could but kill his keeper
          and tear him to pieces in his fury. Mark you, when yonder maniac shall
          get back his reason, he will kiss the feet of that man whom now he
          hates, he will say -- |I bless you for the loving violence which has
          restrained me from my own destruction, I thank you for denying me my
          own will, that you stood in my path and thwarted my mad desire, and
          that you would not let me ruin myself.| Now, poor sinner, God is doing
          this with you. Oh! do not hate him. He does not hate you; he is not
          coaling with you in wrath, but in mercy. There is still behind the
          black cloud the sun of his mercy shining. Oh! that Satan may be cast
          out of you that you may not be tempted to hate God because of his sore
          smitings of you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, perhaps, the temptations of Satan have taken another shape, not so
          much hatred as sullenness. You have lost all you care for now, and you
          think that your state does not matter much to you, you would as soon
          die as live, and as for your soul, you think you cannot be more
          wretched in hell itself than you are, and you say, |So let it be; it
          is so bad that it cannot be mended.| You do not bestir yourself, but
          you sit down with a stony heart waiting to be crushed. You are like
          some poor man benighted on the frozen Alps, who feels sleep creeping
          upon him, and is content to lie down there and die, as he certainly
          must unless some friendly hand shall shake him out of his desperate
          sleep. There is a kind of numbness which pain brings to the body,
          which has its equivalent in the spirit, a numbness because the grief
          has been so acute, that nature could bear no more. Then death itself
          loses its horror in the nearer terrors of the soul. |My soul chooseth
          strangling rather than life.| Soul, Satan desireth to have thee that
          he may utterly destroy thee, and this is one of his ways, he seeks to
          make thee torpid that he may find thee dead; for when thou art sullen
          he knows that the warnings of the ministry, and the earnest
          exhortations of the gospel, will have but little force with thee.
          Wake, man, wake! thy dander is awful! Multitudes have perished here.
          Wake, I pray thee, wake! Oh! if thou hast any sensibility left, bestir
          thee. Depend on it, that bad as thy case is, it will be worse in the
          world to come, unless the badness of it be now blessed to thy soul.
          Oh! man, the pains thou hast had as yet are but as the finger-ache,
          they are but mere trifles compared with the miseries of eternity.
          Instead of opiates to make thee sleep, let them be goads to stir thy
          sluggish flesh, and make thee start from the deadly couch of
          presumption. I would be but too glad if I might thrust lancets into
          thee again, and again, anything sooner than you should sleep that
          sleep of death and be utterly destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly, however, the temptation of Satan has taken the form of
          despair. |Oh,| saith he, |there is no hope for you; you can clearly
          perceive that you are the subject of divine hatred; God has not dealt
          with others as he has with you; these trials are but to first drops of
          the long shower of his eternal wrath. Depend upon it,| says Satan,
          |now that your conscience is in this state, your convictions will
          deepen into a settled remorse, and then that remorse will end in final
          despair, and everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord;
          your sins are too many and too great; there is hope for any man, but
          there is no hope for you; you are beyond the lines of mercy; the arm
          of grace is not long enough or strong enough to reach such a wretch as
          you are; you are not jammed in hell yet, but you are the same as if
          you were; you are reprobate; the decree shuts you out of heaven, while
          the greatness of your sin confirms it; you are bound up in fetters
          that cannot be broken and cast into a horrible pit lout of which you
          never can be drawn.| Satan, thou art a liar, oh! that this poor heart
          did know it: I tell thee this to thy face, for thou didst once bewitch
          me with thy falsehood. Thou didst bring me into this state of despair
          too till I was ready to put an end to myself, because I thought
          nothing awaited me but the wrath of God. Oh! thou lying hell-hound,
          how thou didst slander my Lord and Master. He was willing to receive
          me, but thou modest me think he would reject me; he stood waiting
          about the door of my heart, saying, |Open to me,| and thou saidst that
          he had gone, that he had shut up the bowels of his compassion, and
          doomed for ever to destruction. I will be even with thee, thou great
          destroyer of souls, for thy cruel treachery with me, as long as I live
          I will raise the hue and cry against thee. Soul, do not thou believe
          him, he is a murderer of souls, and a liar from the beginning; there
          is hope for you; there is hope for you now. There is still the gospel
          preached to you: still is it freely presented in your hearing. May you
          say today, |Come, let us return unto the Lord| and he will heal you;
          he will bind you up; he will receive you to his heart; he will in no
          wise cast you out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it may occur, that yet a fourth temptation has been tried with
          some of you. Satan has said, |Well, now, you can see it is of no use.
          Give it up altogether, and if you cannot be happy one way, try
          another; you clearly perceive that you are shut out of heaven, well,
          make the best of this world.| |Now,| says the devil, |Christ will not
          have you, what is the use of your going to a place of worship? Do not
          go, stay away, it is hopeless; the gospel will never be of any use to
          you; you have heard it these three or four years, and you only get
          more hardened; don't go again; besides, why make yourself miserable
          for nothing; drink your fill of the world's delight, if you cannot get
          the best good, get the other; eat, drink, and be merry; live a fast
          life, and satisfy yourself; you may as well be hanged for a sheep as a
          lamb; you may as well perish for a great sin as perish for a little
          one. God evidently has cast you off, follow your own way and choose
          your own delight.| Oh! soul, oh! soul, how sad it is that these
          afflictions and warnings of conscience which are meant to bring you to
          Christ should be used by Satan as the reason why you should go from
          Christ. Oh! soul, the Lord has designs of mercy for you now he has
          begun to try you in your circumstances and afflict you in your soul;
          and the devil knows it, and is afraid of losing you and so he wants
          you to get out of the way of mercy just when mercy is coming. What,
          suppose you have as yet gained no good by attending the means of
          grace, does that prove that you will not soon be blessed? You are
          travelling in the wilderness, you had a torch, and the wind blew it
          out: you lit it again, and it blew it out again, do not say that
          therefore you will never see. The sun is rising, the sun is rising,
          and the fact that torches have been blown out does not prove that the
          night will last for ever. If your false hopes have left you, and your
          self-righteous trusts have all been taken away, I am glad. I am glad
          it is dark with you, for the darkest part of the night is that which
          heralds the dawning of the day. I am glad the Lord has laid you how,
          for it is now he means to hit you up. Do not I pray you be cajoled out
          of this divine mercy by the temptations of the fiend of hell. Rouse
          thee, man! Cry, |Through he slay me yet will I trust in him! If I be
          at Bethesda's pool and the water be not stirred, yet will I die
          there,| (that you will never do; mark that) |though I pray, and he
          hears me not, yet my cries even to my dying hour shall go up to him.|
          And mark you, he will surely hear you; only, do not be led astray of
          the Evil One to turn what is the mercy of God into an excuse for
          excess of riot; but, do you rather listen now to the voice of wisdom
          and mercy, while I seek in the second place to reason with you
          comfortably that I may bring you to say, |Come, let us return unto the
          Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now forget your troubles, for a little while if you can, or only
          think of them as a background for the brightness of THE COMFORT which
          I would give you as God's messenger.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. So you say you have had so many trials in life, and so many
          strivings of conscience, that therefore you feel you must be too
          guilty to be saved. Do you think that you have been punished for your
          sins? Permit me to remind you that this is not the place where the
          Judge of all the earth usually punishes sin; his wrath he reserves for
          the day of judgment and the world to come. All sorrow is the result of
          sin, but still it does not come to any particular man, except in some
          remarkable instances, because of any special sin in him. Now there was
          Job -- will you equal him among the saints? Was he not one of the
          chief of them? Yet he was more tried than any other man; that
          evidently was not because he was a greater sinner than others. Do you
          not know the fact that often the most wicked men are the most
          prosperous, whilst the most holy are the most afflicted? Therefore
          this is not the place where God dispenses providence according to the
          sole and absolute rule of justice; that is to be in the world to come?
          How would you account for such an instance as this, which occurred not
          long ago in a certain railway accident? There were two men who entered
          the train; one of them a Christian, the other a worldling. The
          Christian man took his seat; so did the other. At a station the
          worldly one said, |I should like a game of cards; will you get out and
          go with me? -- there is So-and-so in such a carriage; come with me,
          and we will play together.| |No,| said the other, |I would much rather
          be out of your company, if that is what you are at.| |Well then,| said
          he, |good morning, I am going there.| An accident of the most
          frightful character occurred; the Christian man saw those on each side
          of lam killed; his two companions crushed, and himself such a mass of
          bruises and broken brings as you scarcely ever saw; his leg broken in
          seven different places, and himself as it seemed at death's doctor.
          His companion who went to play cards, was perfectly safe all the
          carriage in which he rode was untouched! Now, this plainly shows that
          this is of the world in which God deals with men according to the
          rules of justice. Ships sink whether men are at prayer, or whether
          they are cursing God. Providence here is not ordered according to the
          rule by which God shall dispense his favors or his fury in the world
          to come. This is the land of long-suffering rather than of execution.
          This is the land where God in his wise providence rather brings us to
          repentance than to punishment. Now I can see the hand of God in all.
          The man who escaped as a card player, I fear, was hardened by the
          providence by which he escaped. Yet, mark you, God was glorified,
          because his providence will become a savor of death unto death to that
          man should he live and die impenitent, while in the Christian who was
          thus injured God is honored, for if you could see him as I saw him,
          with his smiling face relating the fact that he has never murmured
          once, though he had laid upon his bed for very many weeks, you would
          only admire the favor and goodness of God which gave the sinner space
          for repentance, and gave the believer room to display the grace of
          patience. It was good for the one that he was afflicted, it was good
          for the other that he escaped. But this is not the hand of punishment,
          and your having more afflictions than others, may be because God loves
          you; certainly it is not because he hates you. I have seen the wicked
          in great power, spreading themselves like green bay-trees; and I have
          seen them in their death too, and they are not in trouble as other
          men, neither are they plagued like other men; they are at ease, they
          are settled on their lees; they are not emptied from vessel to vessel.
          As for God's people, they are chastened every morning, and vexed every
          evening and the Lord's hand lieth heavy on them; yet there is God's
          goodness in that heavy hand, and infinite lovingkindness in their
          tribulations. God only gives the wicked prosperity as we give husks to
          swine; he gives them this world's transient things because he loves
          them not. I pray you then, do not misconstrue your sufferings of body
          and mind, they may be tokens of mercy; they certainly are not
          indicators of any special wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, you will say that you have great distress of mind, and
          trials of soul, and therefore there is no hope for you. I say,
          therefore, there is hope. Perhaps some of those troubles of mind come
          from Satan. Now observe this, Satan very seldom troubles those men who
          are all his own. A poor negro who had been tempted by Satan was once
          laughed at by his master about it. Said he, |The devil never tempts
          me, I do not even know that there is such a being in existence.| They
          went out sometime after shooting wild ducks, and as the master shot at
          a covey of them and borne of them were wounded he was exceedingly
          earnest with clubs and stones to secure those that were wounded, while
          he left those that were evidently dead to float on the stream till he
          had time to pick them up. This gave the negro a fine opportunity of
          explaining his master's experience. |Massa, whilst you was a splashin'
          in de water after dem wounded ducks, and lettin' de dead ones float
          on, it jist come into my mind why it is dat de debil troubles me so
          much whilst he lets you alone. You are like de dead ducks, he's sure
          he's got you safe. I'm like de wounded ones, trying to git away from
          him, and he's afraid I'll die it, so he makes all de fuss after me and
          jist lets you float on down de stream. He knows he can get you any
          time, but he knows it now or never wid me. If you were to begin to
          flutter a little and show signs like you were a goin' to get away from
          him, he would make jist as big a splashin' after you as he does after
          me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, you will remember that it is not God's way to send
          convictions of sin to reprobates. Do men plough the sand? Do they send
          their oxen upon the rock? No, they attempt to use materials that are
          utterly rotten? No, they give them up, and leave them alone. Now, why
          is the all-wise Jehovah at work with you unless he has gracious
          designs for you; I hope it is because he is about to bring you to
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me show you yet in the third place that this is according to the
          analogy of nature. Did you ever hear this parable? There was a certain
          shepherd who had a sheep, which he desired to lead into another and
          better field. He called it and it would not come, he led it and it
          would not follow, he drove it but it would only follow in own devices.
          At last he thought within himself |I will do this.| The sheep had a
          little lamb by its side, and the shepherd took the lamb up in his
          arms, and carried it away, and then the ewe came too. And so with you,
          God has been calling to you, mother, and you did not come. Christ said
          |Come,| and you would not, he sent affliction and you would not come,
          then he took your child away, and you came then, you followed the
          Saviour then. You see it was loving work on the shepherd's part, he
          did but take the lamb to save the sheep, the Saviour took your child
          to heaven that he might bring you to heaven. We had before the church
          the other night a sister who is here now I dare say, there were four
          in the family and the Lord took one child away. But that was not
          enough he took another, and another, and the fourth lay sick and ready
          to, die and then the mothers heart was broken, and mother and father
          both came to Jesus Oh! blessed afflictions, blessed losses, blessed
          deaths that end in spiritual life! Now this I trust is how God is
          dealing with you. You know, if a man has a field and desires to gather
          a harvest from it, what does he do? First of all he ploughs it. The
          field might say, |Why these scars across my face? Why thus upturn my
          sods?| Because there can be no sowing till there has been ploughing,
          sharp ploughshares make furrows for good seed. Or take yet another
          picture from nature. A man desireth to make of a rusty piece of iron a
          bright sword which shall be serviceable to a great warrior. What doth
          he do? He putteth it into the fire and melteth it, he taketh away all
          its dross and removeth all its till, then he fashioneth it with his
          hammer, he beateth it full sore upon the anvil, he anneals it in one
          fire after another till at last it comes out a good blade that will
          not snap in the day of warfare. This is what God doeth with you -- I
          pray you do not misread the book of God's providence, for if you read
          it aright it runs thus -- |I will have mercy on this man and therefore
          have I smitten him and wounded him. Come, therefore, let us return
          unto the Lord, for he hath wounded and he will heal, he hath smitten
          and he will bind us up.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have other arguments to use, and you must bear with me somewhat
          patiently. Thou art wounded in spirit this morning, poor mourner, wilt
          thou remember that it is God's delight to bind up broken hearts. |He
          telleth the number of the stars.| What its the next verse -- do you
          remember it? -- |He bindeth up the broken in heart.| What a mighty
          stoop this is! From counting the stars and leading them forth, mighty
          worlds though they be, he bows to become a surgeon to the poor wounded
          heart. You know what Christ's occupation is in heaven -- |If he shall
          wipe away tears from oft an faces.| What a blessed occupation --
          wiping away tears! Soul, Christ will be glad to wipe away thy tears
          now. He delights to do it -- Christ is never more happy than when he
          is showing his heart to shiners, he is so glad when he can find his
          poor lost sheep, and put it on his shoulders and carry it home. It
          will maker you glad to be saved; but he will be infinitely glad to
          save you, and delighted to receive you, for he delighteth in mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please remember, yet once again, that the wounds which you now feel he
          made himself, and if he is willing to heal any wounds, how much more
          those that he has himself made. There are some diseases in which the
          surgeon is compelled to wound; the proud flesh has gotten in; the cure
          has been a bad one, and in order that it may be thoroughly sound, he
          perhaps makes a cross out, a deep cross cut that goes into the very
          core of the matter. Well, his lances has made a bad wound, do you
          think the doctor will not do his best to heal it? I will go to him and
          say, |Surgeon, thou didst thyself make the wound, thou modest it in
          order to my healing, heal the wound, I pray thee, heal me.|
          Occasionally when a man has broken his leg, it has been badly set by
          some bungler, and when he has consulted a skillful surgeon, he says,
          |I can do nothing for you till I break your leg again.| And so often
          is it with men's minds; they get peace, peace, when there is no peace,
          and there is no doing anything with them until God breaks their heart
          again. Suppose a surgeon should break a man's led again, do you think
          he would go away and leave the poor man without setting it? No, he
          broke that he might heal, that he might make the cure a sound one. And
          so is it, perhaps, with your broken heart. Go to him, then, go to him;
          say, |Lord, thou didst break my heart; I was a hard blasphemer once,
          but thou hast brought me to my knees. I once said, I would never enter
          a place of worship;' Lord, thou knowest I go there now, though I get
          no comfort there, but I pray thee give me comfort. It was
          such-and-such a sermon that brought me to despair; Lord, guide thy
          servant to preach another that will bring me into liberty. Lord, if
          thou hast not broken my heart, break it now; but if thou hast broken
          it, Lord, I appeal to thee to heal it. Thou hast begun the work by
          killing me, finish the work by making me alive; thou hast begun by
          stripping me, Lord, clothe me.| That is good argument; he will surely
          do it, he will not fail to carry on and complete that which he has
          begun to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more only -- and perhaps this will be the best argument of all --
          remember you have got his promise for it. The text I read as a
          promise. It looks at first sight as if it were spoken by man, and so
          it is; but then inasmuch as it is put in God's book as the utterance
          of God's inspired prophet, it is a part of God's word, and it is
          warranted to be most true. |He hath torn and he will heal.| Go and put
          your finger on this text and say, |Lord, thou hast torn me, and it is
          written in thy word, He will heal us;'|
        </p>
        <p>|Lord, I know thou canst not lie,</p>
        <p>Heal my soul or else I die.|</p>
        <p>
          Put you your finger on the next -- |He will bind us up.| Say, |Lord, I
          do not deserve it; I deserve only to perish, but then thou hast said
          thou wilt do it, be as good as thy word. Lord, here is a poor sinner
          near despair, he comes to thee, bind up his broken heart; give him
          peace;| -- and soul, the everlasting hills shall bow, the hoary deep
          shall itself be burned up, and earth's foundation shall be removed,
          but God's word shall never pass away, nor shall his promise fail in
          one single case. Only believe the promise; receive the promise, and
          this very day, poor broken heart, he will heal thy wounds, and thou
          shalt have joy and peace in believing through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall not detain you much longer, but I have now the third
          point to dwell on upon which earnestly. And O Spirit of the living God
          bless these words, Jesu, do thou woo hearts to thyself whilst we seek
          to will them to thy love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I would come LOVINGLY TO PERSUADE YOU, and the persuasion I
          would use is this -- |Come, let us return unto the Lord.| Do you see
          it! The prophet does not say, |Go,| but |Come;| he does not say, |Go
          you,| but |Come, let us.| Poor soul, thou sayest there is none like
          thyself; behold I take my place side-by-side with thee. Art thou a
          sinner? So am I. Dost thou deserve God's wrath? So do I. Hast thou
          gone very far astray? So have I. Come, let us return, let us go
          together. Or if that comfort thee not enough, let me tell thee I have
          gone as thou now art; as despairing, perhaps more so; as cast down,
          perhaps worse, but I have found him to be a loving Saviour, a blessed
          Saviour, willing and able to save to the uttermost. Soul, come and try
          him, come and try him. My brothers and sisters in Christ in Christ
          reject you when you came to him? You were as bad as others, some in
          you were worse, did he reject you? I am sure that if I should ask it
          there would be not one thousand here but a vast company, who would
          rise and say, |I sought the Lord and he heard me, this poor man cried,
          and the Lord heard me and delivered me from all my fears.| Soul, come,
          let us return. He saved me; he will save you.
        </p>
        <p>|Tell it unto sinners tell</p>
        <p>I am, I am saved from hell.|</p>
        <p>
          If he could and would save one, why not another; and if the thousands
          of Israel, why not poor sinful you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, that I may persuade you further, let me remind you that to
          return to God is not a cruel request to you. He does not ask you to
          perform a pilgrimage and blister your weary feet, or to thrust an iron
          in your back and swing yourself aloft as does the Hindoo, he asks you
          not to lie on a bed of spikes or starve yourself till you can count
          your bones. He asks no suffering of you, for Christ has suffered for
          you. All he asks is than you would return to him, and what is that?
          That you would be unfeignedly sorry for your past sin, that you would
          ask his grace to keep you from it in the future, that you would now
          believe in Christ who is set forth to be the propitiation for sin,
          that through faith in his blood you may see your sin for ever put away
          and all your iniquity cancelled. That is neither a hard nor a cruel
          demand. It is for your good as well as for his glory. O Spirit of God,
          make the sinner now willing to repent and to believe in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, yet again, remember the comfortable fruits which will surely
          follow if you return. What would you think if I could show you
          yourself within a week? There he stands; he is singing --
        </p>
        <p>|A debtor to mercy alone,</p>
        <p>Of covenant mercy I sing;</p>
        <p>Nor fear with thy righteousness on,</p>
        <p>My person and offering to bring.</p>
        <p>The terrors of law and of God,</p>
        <p>With me can have nothing to do;</p>
        <p>My Saviour's obedience and blood,</p>
        <p>Hide all my transgressions from view.|</p>
        <p>
          What man is that? Why, that is the man who came in here last Sunday
          morning, and said he was utterly lost. He heard the minister exhort
          him to trust Christ, and he did it, and that is where he is standing
          now. He has been brought up out of a horrible pit, and out of the miry
          clay, and his feet are set upon a rock. |If I thought that would be
          the case,| saith one, |I would try it.| My dear sir, you need not
          think it will be the case. God promises -- and he cannot lie -- |He
          that believeth and is baptized,| he does not say, |may be,| but |shall
          be saved,| and God's |shalls| and |wills| do not play with men; but he
          speaks them in real earnestness. |Whosoever calleth upon the name of
          the Lord, shall be saved.| Dare you say that this is not true? |No,|
          say you, |it is undoubtedly true.| Well, then, if you call upon the
          name of the Lord you shall be saved, or else the promise is false.
          Again, |though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool; though
          they be red like crimson, they Enroll be whiter than snow.| Do you
          believe that? Is it not a promise made to the penitent who casts
          himself at the feet of Jesus? Very well, try it personally, and if you
          cast yourself there, either this book must be withdrawn, and God must
          change, Christ's blood must lose its power, and God must un-God
          himself, or else he must and will save you. Oh! that there were such a
          heart in you, and such a mind towards God, that you would now say, |I
          do believe; I will believe; I trust my Saviour with my soul.| This
          done, you are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, may I not plead with you to return to God, because of the
          precious love of Christ? Love, I know, has great power to move. You
          will remember how in that wonderful book, |Uncle Tom's Cabin,| there
          is a singular instance of the power of love. Miss Ophelia had been
          laboring to train up that wicked girl biopsy, but she would not learn
          anything, though Miss Ophelia tried to make her say the Assembly's
          Catechism, in order that she might know all about it. But one day,
          Eva, the little five, (the very gospel incarnate, just as Miss Ophelia
          was the picture of the law,) sits down by her side, and says to her,
          |Topsy, why will be so naughty; what is it makes you so wicked?| |Miss
          Eva,| says Topsy, |it aren't no use any being good nobody loves me.|
          The little girl puts her arm round her neck and kisses her, saying.
          |Why I love you, Topsy, and it grieves me very much to see you so
          naughty.| |Oh!| said Topsy, |I will try to be good if you will but
          love me.| Love had won the poor child, and had subdued her. Well, now,
          perhaps you are saying, |If Christ would but say he would love me, I
          think I could repent that I ever sinned against him; I think I would
          be willing to give him my heart.| Soul, if that is what you say, he
          does love you. He loved you and gave himself for you. Behold his cross
          -- is there better proof of love than that? See his flowing wounds;
          hear how he groans; behold him dying! |It is a faithful saying and
          worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to
          save sinners,| and he saves them because he loves them. Oh! if that
          love will woo you, it is indeed in plenteous abundance flowing down to
          you now. |Ah! well,| you say, |I cannot do enough for him.| If that be
          true, I am glad you have got as far as that, and I have finished when
          I have told you an anecdote which I trust will do us all good.
        </p>
        <p>
          A missionary was preaching to the Maori tribe of the New Zealanders.
          He had been truing them of the suffering love of Christ, how he had
          poured forth his soul unto death for them; and as he concluded, the
          hills rung to the thrilling question -- |Is it nothing to an who pass
          by? Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto his Borrow?| Then
          stood forth a plumed and painted chief, the scarred warrior of a
          thousand fights, and as his lips quivered with suppressed emotion, he
          spoke. |And did the Son of the Highest suffer all this for us men?
          Then the Indian chief would like to offer him some poor return for his
          great love. Would the Son of God deign to accept the Indian's hunting
          dog? Swift of foot and keen of scent the tribe has not such another,
          and he has been to the Indian as a friend.| But the missionary told
          him that the Son of God had need of no such gifts as these. Thinking
          he had mistaken the gift he resumed -- |Yet perchance he would accept
          the Indian's rifle? Unerring of aim, the chief cannot replace it.|
          Again the missionary shook his head. For a moment the chief paused;
          then as a new thought struck him, suddenly despoiling himself of his
          striped blanket he cried with childlike earnestness, |Perhaps he who
          had not where to lay his head will yet accept the chieftain's blanket.
          The poor Indian will be cold without it, yet it is offered joyfully.|
          Touched by love's persistency, the missionary tried to explain to him
          the real nature of the Son of God; that it was not men's gifts but
          men's hearts that he yearned for. For a moment a cloud of grief
          darkened the granite features of the old chief; then as the true
          nature of the Son of God slowly dawned upon him, casting aside his
          blanket and rifle he clasped his hands, and looking right up into the
          blue sky, his face beaming with joy, he exclaimed -- |Perhaps the Son
          of the Blessed One will deign to accept the poor Indian himself!|
        </p>
        <p>
          Is that what you say this morning? You would give Christ this, and
          that, and the other. Soul, give him your heart. Say to him now,
        </p>
        <p>|Jesus, I love thy charming name,</p>
        <p>'Tis music to my ear;</p>
        <p>Fain would I sound it out so loud,</p>
        <p>That earth and heaven might hear.|</p>
        <p>
          And then it is done; the compact is concluded; the work is over; thou
          art in the arms of Christ, thou lovest him and he loves thee. He
          wounded but he has healed; he killed thee but he has made thee alive.
          Go in peace; thou art loved much; thy sin which are many are all
          forgiven thee.|<br />
