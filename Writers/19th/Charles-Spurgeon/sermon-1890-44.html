          The Syriac Documents here subjoined are to be regarded as interesting
          relics of the primitive ages, but neither wholly genuine nor in
          details authentic. They have been interpolated and corrupted so as to
          reflect, in some particulars, ideas wholly repugnant to those of
          Christian antiquity, and which first received currency in the period
          of the Iconoclastic controversy. Yet the pages of Eusebius bear
          witness to the Edessene legends as of very early origin, and it is
          reasonable to suppose that they rest on some inquiries made by the
          contemporary Abgar concerning the great Prophet who had appeared in
          Galilee. The visit of the Wise Men from the East, and the history of
          Naaman the Syrian, lend antecedent probability to the idea that such
          inquiries may have been made. The mission of Thaddæus seems a
          historical fact; and if he found Abgar predisposed to believe, and
          familiar with the story of the Christ, the growth of the whole fable
          is sufficiently accounted for. Let me quote Wake in the Preliminary
          Discourse to his Apostolic Fathers. He says: |That both the
          intercourse reported by Eusebius between our Saviour and this prince
          (Abgarus), and the report of the picture being brought to him, have
          been received as a matter of unquestionable truth in those parts, the
          authority of Gregorius Abulpharagius will not suffer us to
          doubt....But Gelasius pronounced the epistle of our Saviour to be
          apocryphal....Natalis Alexander judges both it and the reply of Abgar
          supposititious; and Dupin, after him, yet more solidly convicts it of
          such manifest errors as may satisfy all considering persons that
          Eusebius and Ephraem were too easy of belief in this particular, and
          did not sufficiently examine into it.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But I cannot do better than refer the inquirer to Jones' work On the
          Canon, where, even in early youth, I found the whole matter, and the
          story of the portrait of our Saviour, attractive reading. I owe to
          that work my initiation into the study of what I am now endeavouring
          to elucidate, in some degree, for others. I subjoin the words of
          Lardner, in concluding his candid examination of the matter, as
          follows: |The whole history is the fiction of some Christian at
          Edessa, in the time of Eusebius or not long before. The people of
          Edessa were then generally Christians; and they valued themselves upon
          it, and were willing to do themselves the honour of a very early
          conversion to the Christian faith. By some one of them, or more united
          together, this history was formed, and was so far received by Eusebius
          as to be thought by him not improper to be inserted in his
          Ecclesiastical History.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I conclude that Eusebius was led to put some confidence in it by the
          antecedent probability to which I have referred, favouring the idea
          that some knowledge of Christ had penetrated the mind and heart of
          Abgar even in our Saviour's lifetime. This idea receives some
          countenance from the fact recorded by St. Matthew: |His fame went
          throughout all Syria; and they brought unto Him all sick people that
          were taken with divers diseases,| etc.

          The remarks I have quoted from the learned will sufficiently prepare
          the reader for the other Syriac Documents which follow these Edessene
          Memoirs, as I find it convenient to call them.
        </p>
        <p>Here follows the Introductory Notice by the translator: --</p>
        <p>
          These Documents were selected by the late Dr. Cureton, from
          manuscripts acquired by the British Museum from the Nitrian Monastery
          in Lower Egypt, of which the first portion arrived in 1841, the second
          in 1843, and a third in 1847. The preparation of them for publication
          occupied the closing days of his life. It is to be regretted that his
          death occurred before he was able to write a preface: the more so
          because, to use the words of Dr. W. Wright, the editor of the
          posthumous work, |he had studied the questions connected with this
          volume for years and from every point of view.| In a note occurring in
          the preface to his Festal Letters of Athanasius, he says: |I have
          found among the Syriac mss. in the British Museum a considerable
          portion of the original Aramaic document which Eusebius cites as
          preserved in the archives of Edessa, and various passages from it
          quoted by several authors, with other testimonies which seem to be
          sufficient to establish the fact of the early conversion of the
          inhabitants of that city, and among them of the king himself, although
          his successors afterwards relapsed into paganism. These, together with
          accounts of the martyrdom of some of the first bishops of that city,
          forming a most interesting accession to our knowledge of the early
          propagation of Christianity in the East down to about a.d.300, I have
          already transcribed, and hope to publish.| |He was himself firmly
          persuaded,| adds Dr. Wright, |of the genuineness of the Epistles
          attributed to Abgar, king of Edessa, and our Lord: an opinion which he
          shared with such illustrious scholars as Baronius, Tillemont, Cave, R.
          Mountague (Bishop of Norwich), and Grabe.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Without attempting here to decide what degree of historical value
          belongs to these Documents, it may be proper to observe that the
          several matters contained in them are so far distinct from one another
          that they do not necessarily stand or fall together. Such matters are:
          the celebrated Epistles, the conversion of King Abgar Uchomo, the
          visit of Thaddæus, and the early prevalence of Christianity at Edessa.
          With regard to the letters said to have passed between Abgar and our
          Lord, it seems sufficient, without referring to the internal evidence,
          to remark, with Lardner and Neander, that it is inconceivable how
          anything written by Christ should have remained down to the time of
          Eusebius unknown to the rest of the world The conversion of Abgar is a
          distinct matter of inquiry. But on this again, doubt, to say the
          least, is cast by the statement that Abgar Bar Manu, who reigned
          between the years 160 and 170 a.d., is the first king of Edessa on
          whose coins the usual symbols of the Baal-worship of the country are
          wanting, these being replaced in his case by the sign of the Cross. If
          this refers to a complete series of the coins of Edessa, the evidence
          afforded must be considered very strong. For although, to take a
          parallel instance, |we seek in vain for Christian emblems on the
          coinage of Constantine, the first Christian emperor,| this may readily
          be accounted for by his preference of military distinction to the
          humbler honours conferred by his new faith, whilst it does not appear
          that anti-Christian emblems are found, and on the coins of his son and
          successor Christian emblems do make their appearance. The other two
          subjects referred to do not lie under the same suspicion. There is
          nothing in the nature of the case to disprove the visit of Thaddæus
          (or Addæus) -- nothing improbable in the fact itself, whatever
          judgment may be formed of the details of it presented to us here. If,
          however, the visit of Thaddæus also should have to be ranked among
          apocryphal stories, this would not affect the remaining point -- that
          with which we are chiefly concerned in these Documents. |It is
          certain,| says Neander, |that Christianity was early diffused in this
          country.| How early, is not so certain. But the evidence furnished by
          the later portions of these Documents, which there is nothing to
          contradict and much to confirm, proves that early in the second
          century Christianity had already made many converts there. The
          martyrdoms of Sharbil and Barsamya are said to have occurred a.d.113,
          the year in which Trajan conquered the Parthian kingdom, of which
          Edessa was a part; and, whilst the pagan element was plainly
          predominant, we find the Christians sufficiently numerous to have a
          bishop and presbyters and deacons. This sufficiently falls in with the
          proof already adduced of the conversion of even a king of Edessa about
          fifty years later.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the Documents which are presumably of the ante-Nicene age, Dr.
          Cureton added two Metrical Homilies by Jacob of Serug, who lived in
          the next century. But, as they are so closely connected with the most
          interesting portions of the rest, the martyrdoms, and are besides of
          considerable merit as compositions, the decision of the editors to
          insert them will, it is presumed, be approved by most readers. The two
          supplemental portions, one from the Latin of Simeon Metaphrastes, and
          the other from Le Vaillant de Florival's French translation of Moses
          of Chorene, have also been inserted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation of the Syriac portions, although made with Dr.
          Cureton's version constantly in sight, may fairly be considered as
          independent. The only matter in which his authority has been relied on
          is -- in the case of proper names, the supply of the necessary vowels,
          -- for the text is vowelless. And even to this, one exception occurs,
          in the Martyrdom of Barsamya, where |Evaristus| has been adopted
          instead of his |Erastus.| In regard to the sense, it has been
          frequently found necessary to differ from him, while a style somewhat
          freer, though, it is hoped, not less faithful, has been employed. The
          Metrical Homilies also have been arranged so as to present the
          appearance of poetry. The results of Dr. Wright's collation of the
          text with the mss. have also contributed to the greater correctness of
          the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translator desires very thankfully to acknowledge his obligations
          to Dr. R. Payne Smith, Regius Professor of Divinity in the University
          of Oxford, the progress of whose Thesaurus Syriacus is regarded with
          so much satisfaction and hope, for his kindness in furnishing much
          valuable information respecting matters on which the lexicons are
          silent.

        <p>
          The notes marked Tr. are by the translator. The others, where the
          contrary is not indicated, are, at least in substance, Dr. Cureton's:
          though their citation does not always imply approval.
