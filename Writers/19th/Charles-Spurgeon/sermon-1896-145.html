          81. My soul hath fainted for thy salvation. The Psalmist intimates
          that, although worn out with continual grief, and perceiving no issue
          to his calamities, yet trouble and weariness had not produced such a
          discouraging effect upon his mind, as to prevent him from always
          reposing with confidence in God. To bring out the meaning the more
          distinctly, we must begin at the second clause, which is obviously
          added by way of exposition. There he affirms that he trusts in God;
          and this is the foundation of all. But, intending to express the
          invincible constancy of his trust, he tells us that he patiently
          endured all the distresses, under which others succumb. We see some
          embracing with great eagerness the promises of God; but their ardor,
          within a short time, vanishes; or, at least, is quenched by adversity.
          It was far otherwise with David. The verb klh, kalah, which signifies
          to faint, or to be consumed, seems, indeed, at first sight, to convey
          a different meaning. But the prophet, in this passage, as in other
          places, by fainting means that patience, which those who are deprived
          of all strength, and who seem to be already dead, continue to cherish,
          and which inspires their hearts with secret groanings, and such as
          cannot be uttered. This fainting, then, is opposed to the delicacy of
          those who cannot suffer a long delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          82 My eyes have waxed dim in looking for thy word This verse is very
          similar to the preceding, -- transforming to the eyes what had been
          said before concerning the soul. The only difference is, that, instead
          of longing after salvation or help, the expression, longing after
          God's word compromise, is here used; for salvation is an act, as it is
          termed; that is to say, it consists in effect, whereas a promise keeps
          us suspended in expectation. God may not, all at once, openly perform
          what he has promised; and, in this case, it being only in his word
          that he promises us help, there is no other way by which we can hope
          for help, than by our reposing on his word. As, then, the word
          precedes, in order, the help which God affords, or, rather, as it is
          the manner in which it is represented to our view, the prophet, when
          sighing after salvation, very properly declares that he kept his eyes
          fixed on the Divine word, until his sight failed him. Here we have
          presented to us the wonderful and incredible power of patience, under
          the infirmity of the flesh, when, being faint and deprived of all
          rigor, we have recourse to God for help, even while it is hidden from
          us. In short, the prophet, to prevent it from being supposed that he
          was too effeminate and faint-hearted, intimates that his fainting was
          not without cause. In asking God, When wilt thou comfort me? he shows,
          with sufficient plainness, that he was for a long time, as it were,
          cast off and forsaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          83. For I have been as a bottle in the smoke. The particle ky, ki,
          translated for, might also, not improperly, be resolved into the
          adverb of time, when; so that we might read the verse in one connected
          sentence, thus' When I was like a dried bottle, I, nevertheless, did
          not forget thy law. The obvious design of the Psalmist is to teach us,
          that, although he had been proved by severe trials, and wounded to the
          quick, he yet had not been withdrawn from the fear of God. In
          comparing himself to a bottle or bladder, he intimates that he was, as
          it were, parched by the continual heat of adversities. Whence we
          learn, that that sorrow must have been intense which reduced him to
          such a state of wretchedness and emaciation, that like a shriveled
          bottle he was almost dried up. It, however, appears that he intends to
          point cut, not only the severity of his affliction, but also its
          lingering nature that he was tormented, as it were, at a slow fire;
          even as the smoke which proceeds from heat dries bladders by slow
          degrees. The prophet experienced a long series of grief's, which might
          have consumed him a hundred times, and that, by their protracted and
          lingering nature, had he not been sustained by the word of God. In
          short, it is a genuine evidence of true godliness, when, although
          plunged into the deepest afflictions, we yet cease not to submit
          ourselves to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          84. How many are the days of thy servant? etc. Some read these two
          clauses apart, as if the first were a general complaint of the brevity
          of human life, such as is to be met with in other psalms, and more
          frequently in the book of Job; and next, in their opinion, there
          follows a special prayer of the Psalmist, that God would take
          vengeance upon his enemies. But I rather prefer joining the two
          clauses together, and limit both to David's afflictions; as if it had
          been said, Lord, how long hast thou determined to abandon thy servant
          to the will of the ungodly? when wilt thou set thyself in opposition
          to their cruelty and outrage, in order to take vengeance upon them?
          The Scriptures often use the word days in this sense; as, for example,
          |the days of Egypt,| Ezekiel 30:9; |the days of Babylon,| and |the
          days of Jerusalem,| Psalm 137:7; a word which, in other places, is
          called |the day of visitation,| Isaiah 10:3. By the use of the plural
          number, is denoted a certain determinate portion of time, which, in
          other places, is compared to the |days of an hireling,| Job 14:6;
          Isaiah 16:14. The Psalmist does not, then, bewail in general the
          transitory life of man, but he complains that the time of his state of
          warfare in this world had been too long protracted; and, therefore, he
          naturally desires that it might be brought to a termination. In
          expostulating with God about his trouble, he does not do so
          obstinately, or with a murmuring spirit; but still, in asking how long
          it will be necessary for him to suffer, he humbly prays that God would
          not delay to succor him. As to the point of his stirring him up by
          prayer to execute vengeance, we have elsewhere seen in what sense it
          was lawful for him to make such a request; namely, because the
          vengeance which he desired to see was such as is properly suitable to
          God. It is certain that he had divested himself of all the corrupt
          affections of the flesh, that he might, with a pure and undisturbed
          zeal, desire God's judgment. He, however, in this passage, only wishes
          in general to be delivered by the hand of God from the wrongs which
          were inflicted upon him, without adjudging to perdition his
          adversaries; for he was quite contented, provided God appeared to
          defend him.
        </p>
        <p>
          85 The proud have digged pits for me. He complains that he had been
          circumvented by the frauds and artifices of his enemies; as if he had
          said, They have not only endeavored to injure me by open force and the
          violence of the sword, but have also maliciously sought to destroy me
          by snares and secret arts. The additional clause, which thing is not
          according to thy Law, is introduced as an argument, to excite God to
          exercise his mercy; for he is the more inclined to succor his
          servants, when he sees that the attempts made upon their welfare
          involve the violation of his own Law. At the same time, the Psalmist
          furnishes a proof of his own innocence, intimating that he had
          deserved no such treatment at their hands, and that whatever they
          practiced, he, notwithstanding, patiently kept himself under
          restraint; not attempting any thing which he knew to be contrary to
          the Divine Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          86. All thy commandments are truth. In this verse he again confirms
          the statement, That, in whatever ways he was afflicted, his mind had
          not been distracted by various devices, because, trusting in the word
          of God, he never doubted of his assistance. In the first place, he
          tells us, that the consideration, by which he was armed for repelling
          all assaults, was this, That the faithful, under the conduct of God,
          engage in a prosperous warfare, the salvation which they hope for from
          his word being absolutely certain. For this reason he declares, that
          the commandments of God are true; by which encomium he teaches us,
          that those who rely upon the word of God are out of all danger; and he
          lays down this truth, that such a support may always sustain our
          courage. In the second place, he complains of the treachery of his
          enemies, as he declared before. Here the word sqr, sheker, is
          repeated, by which he means, that they had no regard to equity. From
          this consideration also he was led to entertain the hope of
          deliverance; for it is the peculiar office of God to succor the poor
          and afflicted who are wrongfully oppressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          87. They have almost consumed me upon the earth. He repeats, in
          somewhat different words, what he had spoken a little before, that,
          although he had been sorely tempted, he had nevertheless kept his
          footing, because he had not given up with true religion. A single
          declaration of this fact would have been enough for those who are
          perfect; but if we call to mind our own weakness, we will readily
          confess that it was not unworthy of being repeatedly stated. We not
          only forget the law of God when we are shaken by extreme conflicts,
          but the greater part lose their courage even before they engage in the
          conflict. On which account this wonderful strength of the prophet is
          worthy of more special notice, who, although almost reduced to death,
          yet never ceased to revive his courage by continual meditation on the
          law. Nor is it in vain that he adds, that it was upon the earth that
          his enemies had almost consumed him, conveying the idea, that, when
          the fears of death presented themselves to him on all sides in this
          world, he elevated his mind above the world. If faith reach to heaven,
          it will be an easy matter to emerge from despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          88. Quicken me according to thy goodness This verse contains nothing
          new. In the beginning of it David represents his life as depending on
          God's mercy, not only because he was conscious of human frailty, but
          because he saw himself daily exposed to death in multiplied forms, or
          rather because he was convinced, that were God's power withdrawn from
          him, he would be laid prostrate as if he were dead. He next promises,
          that when he shall be again restored to life, he will not be
          ungrateful, but will duly acknowledge this as a blessing from God, and
          that not only with the tongue, but also in his whole life. As the
          various instances in which God succors us and delivers us from dangers
          are so many new lives, it is reasonable that we should dedicate to his
          service whatever additional time is allotted to us in this world. When
          the law is called the testimony of God's mouth, by this eulogium its
          authority is very plainly asserted.<br />
