          1. Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated in the wisdom of the
          Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary God, but
          by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that
          Principality who is supreme over the universe, and ignorant of him who
          is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a
          virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the
          ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless was more
          righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his
          baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the
          Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and
          performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that
          then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible,
          inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.

          2. Those who are called Ebionites agree that the world was made by
          God; but their opinions with respect to the Lord are similar to those
          of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use the Gospel according to Matthew
          only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an
          apostate from the law. As to the prophetical writings, they endeavour
          to expound them in a somewhat singular manner: they practise
          circumcision, persevere in the observance of those customs which are
          enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style of life, that
          they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.

          3. The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of
          the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles. They lead
          lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very
          plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are
          represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to
          practise adultery, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore
          the Word has also spoken of them thus: |But this thou hast, that thou
          hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.|
