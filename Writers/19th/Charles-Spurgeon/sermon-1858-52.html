          |And the publican, standing afar off would not lift up so much as his
          eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful
          to me a sinner.| -- Luke 18:13.
        </p>

          THE HEROES OF OUR Saviour's stories are most of them selected to
          illustrate traits of character entirely dissimilar to their general
          reputation. What would you think of a moral writer of our own day,
          should he endeavor in a work of fiction, to set before us the gentle
          virtue of benevolence by the example of a Sepoy? And yet, Jesus Christ
          has given us one of the finest examples of charity in the case of a
          Samaritan. To the Jews, a Samaritan was as proverbial for his bitter
          animosity against their nation, as the Sepoy is among us for his
          treacherous cruelty, and as much an object of contempt and hatred; but
          Jesus Christ, nevertheless, chose his hero from the Samaritans, that
          there should be nothing adventitious to adorn him, but that all the
          adorning might be given to the grace of charity. Thus, too in the
          present instance, our Saviour, being desirous of setting before us the
          necessity of humiliation in prayer, has not selected some
          distinguished saint who was famed for his humility, but he has chosen
          a tax-gatherer, probably one of the most extortionate of his class,
          for the Pharisee seems to hint as much; and I doubt not he cast his
          eye askance at this publican, when he observed, with selfgratulation,
          |God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners,
          unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.| Still, our Lord, in
          order that we might see that there was nothing to predispose in the
          person, but that the acceptance of the prayer might stand out, set
          even in a brighter light by the black foil of the publican's
          character, has selected this man to be the pattern and model of one
          who should offer an acceptable prayer unto God. Note that, and you
          will not be surprised to find the same characteristic exhibited very
          frequently in the parables of our Lord Jesus Christ. As for this
          publican, we know but little of his previous career, but we may,
          without perilling any serious error, conjecture somewhat near the
          truth. He may have been, and doubtless he was a Jew, piously brought
          up and religiously trained, but, perhaps like Levi, he ran away from
          his parents, and finding no other trade exactly suited to his vicious
          taste, he became one of that corrupt class who collected the Roman
          taxes, and, ashamed to be known as Levi any longer, he changed his
          name to Matthew, lest anyone should recognize in the degraded cast of
          the publican, the man whose parents feared God, and bowed their knees
          before Jehovah. It may be that this publican had in his youth forsaken
          the ways of his fathers, and given himself up to lasciviousness, and
          then found this unworthy occupation to be most accordant with his
          vicious spirit. We cannot tell how often he had ground the faces of
          the poor, or how many curses had been spilled upon his head when he
          had broken into the heritage of the widow, and had robbed the
          friendless, unprotected orphan. The Roman government gave a publican
          far greater power than he ought to possess, and he was never slow to
          use the advantage for his own enrichment. Probably half of all he had
          was a robbery, if not more, for Zaccheus seems to hint as much in his
          own instance, when he says -- |Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I
          give to the poor and if I have gotten anything of any man by false
          accusation, I restore it unto him four-fold.| It was not often that
          this publican troubled the temple; the priests very seldom saw him
          coming with a sacrifice; it would have been an abomination, and he did
          not bring it. But so it happened, that the Spirit of the Lord met with
          the publican; and had made him think upon his ways, and their peculiar
          blackness: he was full of trouble, but he kept it to himself, pent up
          in his own bosom, he could scarcely rest at night nor go about his
          business by day, for day and night the hand of God was heavy upon him.
          At last, unable to endure his misery any longer, he thought of that
          house of God at Zion, and of the sacrifice that was daily offered
          there. |To whom, or where should I go,| said he, |but to God? -- and
          where can I hope to find mercy, but where the sacrifice is offered.|
          No sooner said than done. He went; his unaccustomed feet bent their
          steps to the sanctuary, but he is ashamed to enter. Yon Pharisee holy
          man as he appeared to be, goes up unblushingly to the court of the
          Israelites. he goes as near as he dare to the very precincts, within
          which the priesthood alone might stand; and he prays with boastful
          language. But as for the publican, he chooses out for himself some
          secluded corner where he shall neither be seen nor heard, and now he
          is about to pray, not with uplifted hands as yonder Pharisee, not with
          eyes turned up to heaven with a sanctimonious gaze of hypocrisy, but
          fixing his eyes upon the ground, the hot tears streaming from them,
          not daring to lift them up to heaven. At last his stifled feelings
          found utterance; yet that utterance was a groan, a short prayer that
          must all be comprehended in the compass of a sigh: |God be merciful to
          me a sinner.| It is done; he is heard; the angel of mercy registers
          his pardon, his conscience is at peace;he goes down to his house a
          happy man, justified rather than the Pharisee, and rejoicing in the
          justification that the Lord had given to him. Well then, my business
          this morning is to invite, to urge, to beseech you to do what the
          publican did, that you may receive what he obtained. There are two
          particulars upon which I shall endeavor to speak solemnly and
          earnestly: the first is confession, the second is absolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Brethren, let us imitate the publican, first of all in his
          CONFESSION. There has been a great deal of public excitement during
          the last few weeks and months about the confessional. As for that
          matter, it is perhaps a mercy that the outward and visible sign of
          Popery in the Church of England has discovered to its sincere friends
          the inward and spiritual evil which had long been lurking there. We
          need not imagine that the confessional, or priestcraft, of which it is
          merely an offshoot, in the Church of England is any novelty: it has
          long been there, those of us who are outside her borders have long
          observed and mourned over it, but now we congratulate ourselves on the
          prospect that the Church of England herself will be compelled to
          discover her own evils; and we hope that God may give her grace and
          strength to cut the cancer out of her own breast before she shall
          cease to be a Protestant Church, and God shall cast her away as an
          abhorred thing. This morning, however, I have nothing to do with the
          confessional. Silly women may go on confessing as long as they like,
          and foolish husbands may trust their wives if they please to such men
          as those. Let those that are fools show it; let those that have no
          sense do as they please about it; but as for myself, I should take the
          greatest care that neither I nor mine have ought to do with such
          things. Leaving that, however, we come to personal matters,
          endeavoring to learn, even from the errors of others, how to act
          rightly ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the publican's confession; to whom was it presented? |God be
          merciful to me a sinner.| Did the publican ever think about going to
          the priest to ask for mercy, and confessing his sins? The thought may
          have crossed his mind, but his sin was too great a weight upon his
          conscience to be relieved in any such way, so he very soon dismissed
          the idea. |No,| saith he, |I feel that my sin is of such a character
          that none but God can take it away; and even if it were right for me
          to go and make the confession to my fellow creature, yet I should
          think it must be utterly unavailing in my case, for my disease is of
          such a nature, that none but an Almighty Physician ever can remove
          it.| So he directs his confession and his prayer to one place, and to
          one alone -- |God be merciful to me a sinner.| And you will note in
          this confession to God, that it was secret: all that you can hear of
          his confession is just that one word -- |a sinner.| Do you suppose
          that was all he confessed? No, beloved, I believe that long before
          this, the publican had made a confession of all his sins privately,
          upon his knees in his own house before God. But now, in God's house,
          all he has to say for man to hear, is -- |I am a sinner.| And I
          counsel you, If ever you make a confession before man, let it be a
          general one but never a particular one. You ought to confess often to
          your fellow creatures, that you have been a sinner, but to tell to any
          man in what respect you have been a sinner, is but to sin over again,
          and to help your fellow creature to transgress. How filthy must be the
          soul of that priest who makes his ear a common sewer for the filth of
          other men's hearts. I cannot imagine even the devil to be more
          depraved, than the man who spends his time in sitting with his ear
          against the lips of men and women, who, if they do truly confess, must
          make him an adept in every vice, and school him in iniquities that he
          otherwise never could have known. Oh, I charge you never pollute your
          fellow creature; keep your sin to yourself, and to your God. He cannot
          be polluted by your iniquity; make a plain and full confession of it
          before him; but to your fellow creature, add nothing to the general
          confession -- |I am a sinner!|
        </p>
        <p>
          This confession which he made before God, was spontaneous, There was
          no question put to this man as to whether he were a sinner or no; as
          to whether he had broken the seventh commandment, or the eighth, or
          the ninth, or the tenth; no, his heart was full of penitence and it
          melted out in this breathing -- |God be merciful to me a sinner.| They
          tell us that some people never can make a full confession, except a
          priest helps them by questions. My dear friends, the very excellence
          of penitence is lost, and its spell broken, if there be a question
          asked: the confession is not true and real unless it be spontaneous.
          The man cannot have felt the weight of sin, who wants somebody to tell
          him what his sins are. Can you imagine any man with a burden on his
          back, who, before he groaned under it, wanted to be told that he had
          got one there? Surely not. The man groans under it, and he does not
          want to be told -- |There it is on your back,| he knows it is there.
          And if, by the questioning of a priest, a full and thorough confession
          could be drawn from any man or woman, it would be totally useless,
          totally vain before God, because it is not spontaneous. We must
          confess our sins, because we cannot help confessing them; it must come
          out, because we cannot keep it in; like fire in the bones, it seems as
          if it would melt our very spirit, unless we gave vent to the groaning
          of our confession before the throne of God. See this publican, you
          cannot hear the abject full confession that he makes; all that you can
          hear is his simple acknowledgment that he is a sinner; but that comes
          spontaneously from his lips; God himself has not to ask him the
          question but he comes before the throne, and freely surrenders himself
          up to the hands of Almighty Justice, confessing that he is a rebel and
          a sinner. That is the first thing we have to note in his confession --
          that he made it to God secretly and spontaneously; and all he said
          openly was that he was |a sinner.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: what did he confess? He confessed, as our text tells us that he
          was a sinner. Now, how suitable is this prayer for us! For is there a
          lip here present that this confession will not suit -- |God be
          merciful to me a sinner?| Do you say, -- |the prayer will suit the
          harlot, when, after a life of sin, rottenness is in her bones and she
          is dying in despair -- that prayer suits her lips?| Ay, but my friend,
          it will suit thy lips and mine too. If thou knowest thine heart, and I
          know mine, the prayer that will suit her will suit us also. You have
          never committed the sins which the Pharisee disowned; you have neither
          been extortionate, nor unjust, nor an adulterer; you have never been
          even as the publican, but nevertheless the word |sinner| will still
          apply to you; and you will feel it to be so if you are in a right
          condition. Remember how much you have sinned against light. It is true
          the harlot hath sinned more openly than you, but had she such light as
          you have had? Do you think she had such an early education and such
          training as you have received? Did she ever receive such checkings of
          conscience and such guardings of providence, as those which have
          watched over your career? This much I must confess for myself -- I do,
          and must feel a peculiar heinousness in my own sin, for I sin against
          light, against conscience, and more, against the love of God received,
          and against the mercy of God promised. Come forward, thou greatest
          among saints, and answer this question, -- dost not this prayer suit
          thee? I hear thee answer, without one moment's pause -- |Ay, it suits
          me now; and until I die, my quivering lips must often repeat the
          petition, Lord have mercy upon me a sinner.' | Men and brethren, I
          beseech you use this prayer to-day, for it must suit you all.
          Merchant, hast thou no sins of business to confess? Woman, hast thou
          no household sins to acknowledge? Child of many prayers, hast thou no
          offense against father and mother to confess? Have we loved the Lord
          our God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our strength;
          and have we each loved our neighbor as ourself. Oh, let us close our
          lips as to any boasting, and when we open them, let these be the first
          words that escape from them, |I have sinned, O Lord; I have broken thy
          commandments; Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner.| But mark, is it not
          a strange thing that the Holy Spirit should teach a man to plead his
          sinnership before the throne of God? One would think that when we come
          before God we should try to talk a little of our virtues. Who would
          suppose that when a man was asking for mercy he would say of himself,
          |I am a sinner?| Why surely reason would prompt him to say, |Lord have
          mercy upon me; there is some good point about me: Lord have mercy upon
          me; I am not worse than my neighbors: Lord have mercy upon me. I will
          try to be better.| Is it not against reason, is it not marvellously
          above reason, that the Holy Spirit should teach a man to urge at the
          throne of grace, that which seems to be against his plea, the fact
          that he is a sinner? And yet, dear brethren, if you and I want to be
          heard, we must come to Christ as sinners. Do not let us attempt to
          make ourselves better than we are. When we come to God's throne, let
          us not for one moment seek to gather any of the false jewels of our
          pretended virtues; rags are the garments of sinners. Confession is the
          only music that must come from our lips; |God be merciful to ME -- a
          sinner;| that must be the only character in which I can pray to God.
          Now, are there not many here who feel that they are sinners, and are
          groaning, sighing, and lamenting, because the weight of sin lies on
          their conscience? Brother, I am glad thou feelest thyself to be a
          sinner, for thou hast the key of the kingdom in thy hands. Thy sense
          of sinnership is thy only title to mercy. Come. I beseech thee, just
          as thou art -- thy nakedness is thy only claim on heaven's wardrobe;
          thy hunger is thy only claim on heaven's granaries, thy poverty is thy
          only claim on heaven's eternal riches. Come just as thou art, with
          nothing of thine own, except thy sinfulness, and plead that before the
          throne -- |God be merciful to me a sinner.| This is what this man
          confessed, that he was a sinner, and he pleaded it, making the burden
          of his confession to be the matter of his plea before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now again, how does he come? What is the posture that he assumes? The
          first thing I would have you notice is that he |stood afar off.| What
          did he do that for? Was it not because he felt himself a separated
          man? We have often made general confessions in the temple, but there
          never was a confession accepted, except it was particular, personal,
          and heartfelt. There were the people gathered together for the
          accustomed service of worship; they join in a psalm of praise, but the
          poor publican stood far away from them. Anon, they unite in the order
          of prayer, still he could not go near them. No, he was come there for
          himself, and he must stand by himself. Like the wounded hart that
          seeks the deepest glades of the forest where it may bleed and die
          alone in profound solitude, so did this poor publican seem to feel he
          must be alone. You notice he does not say anything about other people
          in his prayer. |God be merciful to me,| he says. He does not say |one
          of a company of sinners,| but |a sinner,| as if there were not another
          sinner in all the world. Mark this, my hearer, that thou must feel
          thyself solitary and alone, before thou canst ever pray this prayer
          acceptably. Has the Lord ever picked thee out in a congregation? Has
          it seemed to you in this Hall as if there were a great black wall
          round about you, and you were closed in with the preacher and with
          your God, and as if every shaft from the preacher's bow was levelled
          at you, and every threatening meant for you, and every solemn
          upbraiding was an upbraiding for you? If thou hast felt this, I will
          congratulate thee. No man ever prayed this prayer aright unless he
          prayed alone, unless he said |God be merciful to me,| as a solitary,
          lonely sinner. |The publican stood afar off.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the next thing. |He would not lift up so much as his eyes unto
          heaven.| That was because he dare not, not because he would not; he
          would have done it if he dared. How remarkable it is that repentance
          takes all the daring out of men. We have seen fellows very dare-devils
          before they were touched by sovereign grace, who have become
          afterwards, the most trembling and conscientious men with the
          tenderest conscience that one could imagine. Men who were careless,
          bragging and defying God, have become as humble as little children,
          and even afraid to lift their eyes to heaven, though once they sent
          their oaths and curses there. But why did he not dare to lift his eyes
          up? It was because he was dejected in his |spirit,| so oppressed and
          burdened that he could not look up. Is that thy case my friend this
          morning? Are you afraid to pray? Do you feel as if you could not hope
          that God would have mercy on you, as if the least gleam of hope was
          more light than you could possibly bear; as if your eyes were so used
          to the darkness of doubt and despondency, that even one stolen ray
          seemed to be too much for your poor weak vision? Ah! well, fear not,
          for happy shall it be for thee; thou art only following the publican
          in his sad experience now, and the Lord who helps thee to follow him
          in the confession, shall help thee to rejoice with him in the
          absolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note what else he did. He smote upon his breast. He was a good
          theologian he was a real doctor of divinity. What did he smite his
          breast for? Because he knew where the mischief lay -- in his breast.
          He did not smite upon his brow as some men do when they are perplexed,
          as if the mistake were in their understanding. Many a man will blame
          his understanding, while he will not blame his heart, and say, |Well,
          I have made a mistake. I have certainly been doing wrong, but I am a
          good-hearted fellow at the bottom.| This man knew where the mischief
          lay, and he smote the right place.
        </p>
        <p>|Here on my heart the burden lies.|</p>
        <p>
          He smote upon his breast as if he were angry with himself. He seemed
          to say, |Oh! that I could smite thee, my ungrateful heart, the harder,
          that thou hast loved sin rather than God.|| He did not do penance, and
          yet it was a kind of penance upon himself when he smote his breast
          again and again, and cried |Alas! alas! woe is me that I should ever
          have sinned against my God| -- |God be merciful to a sinner.| Now, can
          you come to God like this, my dear friend? Oh, let us all draw near to
          God in this fashion. Thou hast enough, my brother, to make thee stand
          alone for there have been sins in which thou and I have stood each of
          us in solitary guilt. There are iniquities known only to ourselves,
          which we never told to the partner of our own bosom, not to our own
          parents or brothers, nor yet to the friend with whom we took sweet
          counsel. If we have sinned thus alone, let us go to our chambers, and
          confess alone, the husband apart, and the wife apart, the father
          apart, and the child apart. Let us each one wail for himself. Men and
          brethren, leave off to accuse one another. Cease from the bickerings
          of your censoriousness. and from the slanders of your envy. Rebuke
          yourselves and not your fellows. Rend your own hearts, and not the
          reputation of your neighbors. Come, let each man now look to his own
          case, and not to the case of another, let each cry, |Lord, have mercy
          upon me, as here I stand alone, a sinner.| And hast thou not good
          reason to cast down thine eyes? Does it not seem sometimes too much
          for us ever to look to heaven again. We have blasphemed God, some of
          us, and even imprecated curses on our own limbs and eyes; and when
          those things come back to our memory we may well be ashamed to look
          up. Or if we have been preserved from the crime of open blasphemy --
          how often have you and I forgotten God! how often have we neglected
          prayer! how have we broken his Sabbaths and left his Bible unread!
          Surely these things as they flash across our memory, might constrain
          us to feel that we cannot lift up so much as our eyes towards heaven.
          And as for smiting on our breast, what man is there among us that need
          not do it? Let us be angry with ourselves, because we have provoked
          God to be angry with us. Let us be in wrath with the sins that have
          brought ruin upon our souls, let us drag the traitors out, and put
          them at once to a summary death; they deserve it well; they have been
          our ruin; let us be their destruction. He smote upon his breast and
          said, |God, be merciful unto me a sinner.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other feature in this man's prayer, which you must not
          overlook. What reason had he to expect that God would have any mercy
          upon him? The Greek explains more to us than the English does, and the
          original word here might be translated -- |God be propitiated to me a
          sinner.| There is in the Greek word a distinct reference to the
          doctrine of atonement. It is not the Unitarian's prayer -- |God be
          merciful to me,| it is more than that -- it is the Christian's prayer,
          |God be propitiated towards me, a sinner.| There is, I repeat it, a
          distinct appeal to the atonement and the mercy-seat in this short
          prayer, Friend, if we would come before God with our confessions, we
          must take care that we plead the blood of Christ. There is no hope for
          a poor sinner apart from the cross of Jesus. We may cry, |God be
          merciful to me,| but the prayer can never be answered apart from the
          victim offered, the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the
          world. When thou hast thine eye upon the mercy-seat, take care to have
          thine eye upon the cross too. Remember that the cross is, after all
          |the mercy seat; that mercy never was enthroned, until she did hang
          upon the cross crowned with thorns. If thou wouldst find pardon, go to
          dark Gethsemane, and see thy Redeemer sweating, in deep anguish, gouts
          of gore. If thou wouldst have peace of conscience, go to Gabbatha, the
          pavement, and see thy Saviour's back flooded with a stream of blood.
          If thou wouldst have the last best rest to thy conscience, go to
          Golgotha; see the murdered victim as he hangs upon the cross, with
          hands and feet and side all pierced, as every wound is gaping wide
          with misery extreme. There can be no hope for mercy apart from the
          victim offered -- even Jesus Christ the Son of God. Oh, come; let us
          one and all approach the mercy-seat, and plead the blood. Let us each
          go and say, |Father, I have sinned; but have mercy upon me, through
          thy Son.| Come, drunkard, give me thy hand; we will go together.
          Harlot, give me thy hand too; and let us likewise approach the throne.
          And you, professing Christians, come ye also, be not ashamed of your
          company. Let us come before his presence with many tears, none of us
          accusing our fellows, but each one accusing himself; and let us plead
          the blood of Jesus Christ, which speaketh peace and pardon to every
          troubled conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Careless man, I have a word with thee before I have done on this
          point. You say, |Well, that is a good prayer, certainly, for a man who
          is dying. When a poor fellow has the cholera, and sees black death
          staring him in the face, or when he is terrified and thunderstruck in
          the time of storm, or when he finds himself amidst the terrible
          confusion and alarm of a perilous catastrophe or a sudden accident,
          while drawing near to the gates of death, it is only right that he
          should say, Lord have mercy upon me.| Ah, friend, the prayer must be
          suitable to you then, if you are a dying man; it must be suitable to
          you, for you know not how near you are to the borders of the grave.
          Oh, if thou didst but understand the frailty of life and the
          slipperiness of that poor prop on which thou art resting, thou wouldst
          say, |Alas for my soul! if the prayer will suit me dying, it must suit
          me now; for I am dying, even this day, and know not when I may come to
          the last gasp.| |Oh,| says one, |I think it will suit a man that has
          been a very great sinner.| Correct, my friend, and therefore, if you
          knew yourself; it would suit you. You are quite correct in saying,
          that it won't suit any but great sinners; and if you don't feel
          yourself to be a great sinner, I know you will never pray it. But
          there are some here that feel themselves to be what you ought to feel
          and know that you are. Such will, constrained by grace, use the prayer
          with an emphasis this morning, putting a tear upon each letter, and a
          sigh upon each syllable, as they cry, |God be merciful to me, a
          sinner.| But mark, my friend, thou mayest smile contemptuously on the
          man that makes this confession, but he shall go from this house
          justified, while thou shalt go away still in thy sins, without a hope,
          without a ray of joy to cheer thy unchastened spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus briefly described this confession, I come more briefly
          still to notice the ABSOLUTION which God gave. Absolution from the
          lips of man I do believe is little short of blasphemy. There is in the
          Prayer Book of the Church of England an absolution which is
          essentially Popish, which I should think must be almost a verbatim
          extract from the Romish missal. I do not hesitate to say, that there
          was never anything more blasphemous printed in Holywell Street, than
          the absolution that is to be pronounced by a clergyman over a dying
          man; and it is positively frightful to think that any persons calling
          themselves Christians should rest easy in a church until they have
          done their utmost to get that most excellent book thoroughly reformed
          and revised, and to get the Popery purged out of it. But there is such
          a thing as absolution, my friends, and the publican received it. |He
          went to his house justified rather than the other.| The other had
          nought of peace revealed to his heart, this poor man had all, and he
          went to his house justified. It does not say that he went to his
          house, having eased his mind; that is true, but more: he went to his
          house |justified.| What does that mean? It so happens that the Greek
          word here used is the one which the apostle Paul always employs to set
          out the great doctrine of the righteousness of Jesus Christ -- even
          the righteousness which is of God by faith. The fact is, that the
          moment the man prayed the prayer, every sin he had ever done was
          blotted out of God's book, so that it did not stand on the record
          against him; and more, the moment that prayer was heard in heaven, the
          man was reckoned to be a righteous man. All that Christ did for him
          was cast about his shoulders to be the robe of his beauty, that moment
          all the guilt that he had ever committed himself was washed entirely
          away and lost for ever. When a sinner believes in Christ, his sins
          positively cease to be, and what is more wonderful they all cease to
          be, as Kent says in those well known lines --
        </p>
        <p>|Here's pardon for transgressions past,</p>
        <p>It matters not how black their cast,</p>
        <p>And, O my soul with wonder view</p>
        <p>For sins to come here's pardon too.|</p>
        <p>
          They are all swept away in one solitary instant; the crimes of many
          years; extortions, adulteries, or even murder, wiped away in an
          instant; for you will notice the absolution was instantaneously given.
          God did not say to the man -- |Now you must go and perform some good
          works, and then I will give you absolution.| He did not say as the
          Pope does, |Now you must swelter awhile in the fires of Purgatory, and
          then I will let you out.| No, he justified him there and then; the
          pardon was given as soon as the sin was confessed. |Go, my son, in
          peace; I have not a charge against thee; thou art a sinner in thine
          own estimation, but thou art none in mine; I have taken all thy sins
          away, and cast them into the depth of the sea, and they shall be
          mentioned against thee no more for ever.| Can you tell what a happy
          man the publican was, when all in a moment he was changed? If you may
          reverse the figure used by Milton, he seemed himself to have been a
          loathsome toad, but the touch of the Father's mercy made him rise to
          angelic brightness and delight; and he went out of that house with his
          eye upward, no longer afraid. Instead of the groan that was on his
          heart, he had a song upon his lip. He no longer walked alone, he
          sought out the godly and he said, |Come and hear, ye that fear God,
          and I will tell you what he has done for my soul.| He did not smite
          upon his breast, but he went home to get down his harp, and play upon
          the strings, and praise his God. You would not have known that he was
          the same man, if you had seen him going out, and all that was done in
          a minute. |But,| says one, | do you think he knew for certain that all
          his sins were forgiven? Can a man know that?| Certainly he can. And
          there be some here that can bear witness that this is true. They have
          known it themselves. The pardon which is sealed in heaven is re-sealed
          in our own conscience. The mercy which is recorded above is made to
          shed its light into the darkness of our hearts. Yes, a man may know on
          earth that his sins are forgiven, and may be as sure that he is a
          pardoned man as he is of his own existence. And now I hear a cry from
          some one saying, |And may I be pardoned this morning? and may I know
          that I am pardoned? May I be so pardoned that all shall be forgotten
          -- I who have been a drunkard, a swearer, or what not? May I have all
          my transgressions washed away? May I be made sure of heaven, and all
          that in a moment?| Yes, my friend, If thou believest in the Lord Jesus
          Christ, if thou wilt stand where thou art, and just breathe this
          prayer out, |Lord, have mercy! God be merciful to me a sinner, through
          the blood of Christ.| I tell thee man, God never did deny that prayer
          yet; if it came out of honest lips he never shut the gates of mercy on
          it. It is a solemn litany that shall be used as long as time shall
          last, and it shall pierce the ears of God as long as there is a sinner
          to use it. Come, be not afraid, I beseech you, use the prayer before
          you leave this Hall. Stand where you are; endeavor to realize that you
          are an alone, and if you feel that you are guilty. now let the prayer
          ascend. Oh, what a marvellous thing, it from the thousands of hearts
          here present, so many thousand prayers might go up to God! Surely the
          angels themselves never had such a day in Paradise, as they would have
          to-day, if every one of us could unfeignedly make that confession.
          Some are doing it; I know they are; God is helping them. And sinner,
          do you stay away? You, who have most need to come, do you refuse to
          join with us. Come, brother come. You say you are too vile. No,
          brother, you cannot be too vile to say, |God be merciful to me.|
          Perhaps you are no viler than we are; at any rate, this we can say --
          we feel ourselves to be viler than you, and we want you to pray the
          same prayer that we have prayed. |Ah,| says one, |I cannot; my heart
          won't yield to that; I cannot.| But friend, if God is ready to have
          mercy upon thee, thine must be a hard heart, if it is not ready to
          receive his mercy. Spirit of God, breathe on the hard heart, and melt
          it now! Help the man who feels that carelessness is overcoming him --
          help him to get rid of it from this hour. You are struggling against
          it; you are saying, |Would to God I could pray that I could go back to
          be a boy or a child again, and then I could; but I have got hardened
          and grown grey in sin, and prayer would be hypocrisy in me. No,
          brother, no, it would not. If thou canst but cry it from thy heart, I
          beseech thee say it. Many a man thinks he is a hypocrite, when he is
          not, and is afraid that he is not sincere, when his very fear is a
          proof of his sincerity. |But,| says one, |I have no redeeming trait in
          my character at all.| I am glad you think so; still you may use the
          prayer, |God be merciful to me.| |But it will be a useless prayer,|
          says one. My brother, I assure thee not in my own name, but in the
          name of God, my Father and your Father, it shall not be a useless
          prayer. As sure as God is God, him that cometh unto Christ he will in
          no wise cast out. Come with me now, I beseech thee; tarry no longer;
          the bowels of God are yearning over thee. Thou art his child, and he
          will not give thee up. Thou hast run from him these many years, but he
          has never forgotten thee; thou hast resisted all his warnings until
          now, and he is almost weary, but still he has said concerning thee,
          |How shall I make thee as Admah; how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine
          heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.|
        </p>
        <p>|Come humbled sinner, in whose breast</p>
        <p>A thousand thoughts revolve;</p>
        <p>Come with thy guilt and fear oppressed,</p>
        <p>And make this last resolve:</p>
        <p>I'll go to Jesus; though my sin</p>
        <p>Hath like a mountain rose,</p>
        <p>I know his courts; I'll enter in,</p>
        <p>Whatever may oppose.</p>
        <p>Prostrate I'll lie before his face,</p>
        <p>And there my sins confess;</p>
        <p>I'll tell him I'm a wretch undone,</p>
        <p>Without his sov'reign grace.|</p>
        <p>
          Go home to your houses: let everyone -- preacher, deacon, people, ye
          of the church, and ye of the world, everyone of you, go home, and ere
          you feast your bodies, pour out your hearts before God, and let this
          one cry go up from all our lips, |God be merciful to me a sinner.|
        </p>
        <p>I pause. Bear with me.</p>
        <p>
          I must detain you a few moments. Let us use this prayer as our own
          now. Oh that it might come up before the Lord at this time as the
          earnest supplication of every heart in this assembly! I will repeat
          it, -- not as a text, but as a prayer, -- as my own prayer, as your
          prayer. Will each one of you take it personally for himself? Let
          everyone, I entreat you, who desires to offer the prayer, and can join
          in it, utter at its close an audible |Amen.|
        </p>
        <p>Let us pray,</p>
        <p>|GOD-BE-MERCIFUL-TO-ME-A-SINNER.|</p>
        <p>[And the people did with deep solemnity say] |AMEN.|</p>
        <p>
          P.S. -- The preacher hopes that he who reads will feel constrained
          most solemnly to do likewise.<br />
