        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.635)</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?| -- Jeremiah 12:5.</p>
        <p>
          CANAAN MAY BE CONSIDERED as a type of two states or conditions in the
          Christian's life. It was the land of rest to the children of Israel
          after a weary pilgrimage in the wilderness. Now it is written that |we
          who believe do enter into rest.| A true Christian possessed of strong
          faith will not have a wilderness state on earth so much as a land
          flowing with milk and honey, because his faith will give him the
          substance of things hoped for, and be the evidence of things not seen.
          Many disciples live a life of depression, wretchedness, and
          discomfort, which would be completely changed if they had faith in
          God, and lived a higher life of devotedness and love. Canaan may be
          fairly considered as a type of that better state of Christianity which
          some enjoy. It is not altogether free from ills; the Canaanite dwells
          in the land, and there are wars and fightings still; but there is
          rest, and there is the spirit of service developing itself in the
          cultivation of the promised land. But Canaan is generally used to
          shadow forth |the rest which remaineth for the people of God| beyond
          the skies. Heaven is thus frequently described as corresponding to the
          earthly inheritance of the Jews. It is our hope, the end of our
          pilgrimage. It contains our Jerusalem, and the temple, |not made with
          hands.| When this is the view taken of the type, then Jordan is not
          unnaturally likened unto death. Its dark waters are made to picture
          forth to our minds the chill stream through which we wade in the dying
          hour. It is a beautiful emblem, and we have all doubtless sung Dr.
          Watt's hymn with much feeling --
        </p>
        <p>|There is a land of pure delight,</p>
        <p>Where saints immortal reign;</p>
        <p>Infinite day excludes the night,</p>
        <p>And pleasures banish pain.|</p>
        <p>There everlasting spring abides,</p>
        <p>And never-withering flowers;</p>
        <p>Death, like a narrow sea, divides</p>
        <p>This heavenly land from ours.|</p>
        <p>
          Taking |the swelling of Jordan| to represent the precise time of
          death, the question really is, what shall we do when we come to die?
          |How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We notice, in the first place, that this is an EXCEEDINGLY
          PRACTICAL QUESTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          How wilt thou do? Is the enquiry. There are some subjects which are
          more or less matters of pure faith and personal feeling; and though
          all Christian doctrines bear more or less directly upon the Christian
          life, yet they are not what is commonly meant by practical subjects.
          Our text, however, brings us face to face with a matter which is
          essentially a matter of doing and of acting; it asks how we mean to
          conduct ourselves in the hour of death. We sometimes hear the remark
          made by those who object to doctrinal preaching, that we are too
          speculative, and utter our own opinions, which feed men's fancies, but
          do not regulate life. Now we believe that every promise leads to a
          precept, and every doctrine has its duty; so we will not admit the
          justice of the insinuation even if we did preach doctrine entirely to
          the exclusion of the commandments, which we emphatically deny; but
          here we have at any rate a topic practical enough, I am only afraid it
          will be a little too much so for some; thy will turn it into a
          sentiment and a feeling, and not act upon it so as to put it into
          practice, and exemplify its power in after days. Christians may differ
          from men on some points, but I am sure that here we are united in
          belief -- we must die, and ought not to die unprepared. There is a
          divergence of opinion as to what we ought to do at the commencement of
          Christian life; I maintain that we ought to follow Christ, and be
          immersed in water, |for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
          righteousness;| others oppose that as being unnecessary, inexpedient,
          or what not; we differ at the beginning of lie, but we agree in the
          end; we must die; and we all want to die the death of the righteous,
          and to have our last end like his.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We notice, in the second place, that is UNDOUBTEDLY A PERSONAL
          QUESTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          How wilt thou do? It individualizes us, and makes us each one to come
          face to face with a dying hour. Now we all need this, and it will be
          well for each one of s to look for a minute into the grave. We are too
          apt to regard al men as mortal but ourselves. Somehow we can see
          frailty of life, as well as all the other frailties which we possess
          in common, much more clearly in other people than we can ourselves. We
          are blind to our own weakness far too much, and shall do well to ask
          ourselves, each of us, |My soul, how wilt thou do in the swelling of
          Jordan?| The ancient warrior who wept because before a hundred years
          were passed, he knew his immense army would be gone, and not a man
          remains behind to tell the tale, would have been wiser, if he had wept
          also for himself, and left alone his bloody wars, and lived as a man
          who must be one day die, and find after death a day of judgment. Each
          one of you must die. If I were addressing an assembly of the sages of
          the world, I should say, |All your combined wisdom cannot lengthen out
          the days of one of you even a single minute. You may reckon the
          distance of the stars, and weigh worlds, but you cannot tell me when
          one of you will die, nor how many grains of sand are left behind in
          the hourglass of time, which shows the exit of each spirit from the
          world.| I say now to you the wisest of you must die; and you know not
          but that you may die ere long. So with the mightiest, and the richest
          of men. Samson was mastered by a stronger than man, and the wealthiest
          of man cannot bribe death to stay his dart for a single hour. We all
          come into the world one by one, and will go out of it also alone.
          Loved ones come to the brink of the dark stream, but there they sake
          hands and say |farewell,| and we go on alone. The prophet's companion
          and successor followed his master until the fiery chariot came to take
          his leader away; but when the messengers of God came, they left the
          servant behind, vainly crying, |My father, My father, the chariot of
          Israel and the horsemen thereof.| We had better therefore take the
          question up as individuals, seeing that it is one in which we shall be
          dealt with singly, and be unable then to claim or use the help of an
          earthly friend. I put to the young, to the old; to the rich, to the
          poor; to each one of this vast assembly -- I put it, as if we were
          alone before God -- |How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. As a third thought, we call attention to the fact that it is one
          of the MOST SOLEMN questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Death and life are stern and awful realities. To say that anything |is
          a matter of life and death| is to bring one of the most emphatic and
          solemn subjects under our notice. Now, the question we are considering
          this morning is of this character, and we must deal with it as it
          becomes us, when we investigate a subject involving the everlasting
          interest of souls. The question is of infinite importance to all, but
          there are some whose case is manifestly such, that they need to gird
          up the loins of their minds and address themselves to its
          consideration, with intensest thought and care. Let me cal attention
          to one or two cases, for while I wish to stir up all, I am bidden to
          have especial compassion on some, making a difference, so that I may
          pluck them as brands out of the fire. I have been curious enough to
          think that I should like to ask that question of a Jew, of one who
          rejects Christ as the Messiah. |How wilt thou do in the swelling of
          Jordan?| According to the law, and it is that under which every Jew is
          born, |Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are
          written in the book of the aw to do them.| Now there never was, and
          never will be any man who did, or could |continue in all things
          written in the book of the law to do them,| and consequently every man
          becomes accursed; and it must be a dreadful thing for a man to think
          of dying under the curse and ban of his own religious faith; and yet
          every Jew is so, cursed by his own book of law, accursed for ever.
          What comfort will that yield him when he comes to the swelling of
          Jordan. I have though too, that I should like to ask the atheist, the
          unbeliever, this question, |How wilt thou do in the swelling of
          Jordan?| He tells me, perhaps. That he believes in annihilation: he
          will want comfort when he is lying upon that weary bed; will he get it
          out of that well? The dreary blank of total destruction, of ceasing to
          be; is there anything to help a spirit when it lies where it most
          wants consolation, tossing to and fro in pain and weakness? I think
          not. I should like also to put the question to a Roman Catholic; for
          how will he do |in the swelling of Jordan?| Some tine ago you wilt
          remember a Prince of the Catholic Church departed: where did he go? I
          am not versed in such matters, and should not like to judge anybody's
          soul, but on the coffin of the Cardinal we find a request that we
          would pray for his soul, and there have been masses said for its
          repose. It is evident, therefore, that the Cardinal's soul went
          somewhere, where it wants praying for, and to some place where it is
          not in repose. Now if this is to be the lot of a Cardinal Archbishop,
          there is but a poor lookout for an ordinary professor of the same
          faith; if a prince in the Church dies, and goes not to heaven as we
          have been hoping, not to eternal rest, but to a place where he needs
          our intercession, and where he has no repose for his soul, why then it
          must be dreadful work to die with such a creed as that. I would sooner
          have beneath my head the most prickly thornbush, than have that for my
          dying pillow. Oh, we want something better than this, a hope more
          rapturous, more divine, more full of immortality than the certainty of
          going to a place where there is no repose, and where our souls need
          the prayers of sinful men on earth. But I do not know that we have
          very much to do with any of these, they must |gang their an gait|,
          they must go their own way; and if they be found wrong at the last, we
          are so sorry that it should be so, but our own business is certainly
          the first matter in hand. Therefore, forgetting them, let the question
          come to each of us, |How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?|
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Remember, in the fourth place, that his question was put by way of
          REBUKE to the prophet Jeremiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          He seems to have been a little afraid of the people among whom he
          dwelt. They had evidently persecuted him very much, mocked at him, and
          laughed him to scorn; but God tells him to make his face like flint,
          and not to care for them, for, says he, |If thou art afraid of them,|
          How wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?| This ought to be a
          rebuke to every Christian who is subject to the fear of man. I do not
          believe that any preacher will be long in his pulpit without having
          the temptation to be afraid of some man or another, and if he doth not
          stand very firmly upon his integrity he will find some of the best of
          his friends getting the upper hand with him. And this will never do
          with God's minister. He must deal out God's Word impartially to rich
          or poor, to good or bad; and he must determine to have no master
          except his Master who is in heaven; no bit nor bridle for his mouth,
          except that of prudence and discretion, which God himself shall put
          there. For if we are afraid of a man that shall die, and the son of
          man is crushed before the moth, how fearful shall we be when we have
          to talk with the grim king of terrors! If we are afraid of puny man,
          how shall we be able to face it out before the dread ordeal of the day
          of judgment? Yet I know some Christians that are very much abashed by
          the world's opinion, by the opinion of their family circle, or of the
          workshop. Now what does it matter after all? There is an old proverb,
          that |he is a great fool that is laughed out of his coat;| and there
          was an improvement on it, that |he was a greater fool who was laughed
          out of his skin;| and there is another, that |he is the greatest fool
          of all who is laughed out of his sou.| He will be content to be damned
          in order to be fashionable, pays dear indeed for what he gets. Oh, to
          dare to be singular, if to be singular is to be right; but if you are
          afraid of man, what will you do in the swelling of Jordan? The same
          rebuke might be applied to us when we get fretful under the little
          troubles of life. You have losses in business, vexations int he family
          -- you have all crosses to carry -- but my text comes to you, and it
          says, |If you cannot bear this, how will you do in the swelling of
          Jordan? If your religion is not equal to the ordinary emergencies of
          common days, what will you do when you get to that extraordinary day,
          which will be to you the most important day of your being?| Come
          friends, be not bowed down with these things, bear them cheerfully,
          since there is much sterner work to do than any that you have met with
          in the battle of life. And the same reproof might come to us when we
          get petulant under pains of body, for there are some of us, who as
          soon as ever we get a little unwell, become so fretful, that those
          like us best who are farthest from us; we can scarcely have a little
          depression of spirit, but straightway we are ready to give up all for
          lost, and like Jonah say, |We do well to be angry even unto death.|
          Now this ought not to be. We should quit ourselves like men, and not
          be perturbed with these little rivulets; for if these sweep us away,
          what shall we do when Jordan is swollen to the brim, and we have to
          pass through that? When one of the martyrs, whose name is the somewhat
          singular one of Pommily, was confined previous to his burning, his
          wife was also taken up upon the charge of heresy. She, good woman, has
          revolved to die with her husband, and she appeared, as far as most
          people could judge, to be very firm in her faith. But the jailer's
          wife, though she had no religion, took a merciful view of the case as
          far as she could do so, and thought, |I am afraid this woman will
          never stand the test, she will never burn with her husband, she has
          neither faith nor strength enough to endure the trial;| and therefore,
          one day calling her out from her cell, she said to her, |Lass, run to
          the garden and fetch me the key that lies there.| The poor woman ran
          willingly enough; she took the key up and it burned her fingers, for
          the jailer's wife had made it red hot; she came running back crying
          with pain. |Ay, wench,| said she, |if you cannot bear a little burn in
          your hand, how will you bear to be burned in your whole body;| and
          this, I am sorry to add, was the means of bringing her to recant the
          faith which she professed, but which never had been in her heart. I
          apply the story thus: If we cannot bear the little trifling pangs
          which come upon us in our ordinary circumstances, which are but as it
          were the burning of your hands, what shall we do when every pulse
          beats pain, and every throb is an agony, and the whole tenement begins
          to crumble about the spirit that is so soon to be disturbed? Come, let
          us pluck up courage! We have to fight the giant yet! Let us not be
          afraid of these dwarfs! Let the ordinary trials of every day be
          laughed to scorn! In the strength of divine grace, let us sing with
          out poet,
        </p>
        <p>|Weak as I am, yet through thy strength,</p>
        <p>I all things can perform.|</p>
        <p>
          For it we cannot bear these, how will we do in the swelling of Jordan?
          This is what the text was ordinally meant to teach. We will now use it
          for a further purpose.
        </p>
        <p>V. The question may be put as A MATTER OF CAUTION.</p>
        <p>
          In this assembly, there are some who have no hope, no faith in Christ.
          Now I think, if they will look within at their own experience, they
          will find that already they are by no means completely at ease. The
          pleasure of this world are very sweet; but how soon they cloy, if they
          do not sicken the appetite. After the night of merriment there is
          often the morning of regret. |Who hath woe? Who hath redness of eyes?
          They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.| It
          is an almost universal confession that the joys of earth promise more
          than they perform, and that in looking back upon them, the wisest must
          confess with Solomon, |Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.| Now if
          these things seem to be vanity while you are in good bodily health,
          how will they look when you are in sickness? If vanity while you can
          enjoy them, what will they appear when you must say farewell to them
          all? If it was vanity to the rich man while he was clothed in purple
          and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day, what greater vanity
          it must have been when it was said, |This night thy soul shall be
          required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast
          provided?| How wilt thou do in Jordan when these joys shall vanish,
          and there shall be a dreary blank before thee? Moreover, you feel
          already that conscience pricks you. You cannot live without God and be
          perfectly easy, unless you are one of those few who are given up to
          judicial blindness and hardness of heart. You could not take an hour
          quietly to think about yourself and your state, and yet go to your bed
          easily. You know right well that the only way some of you can keep up
          peace of mind at al, is by going from one gay assembly to another, and
          from one party of frolic to another, or else from business to
          business, and from care to care. Your poor soul, like the infant which
          is to be cast into Moloch's arms, cries, and you do not hear its
          cries, because you drown it with the noisy drums of this world's
          pleasures and cares; but still you are not at rest; there is a worm in
          your fair fruit, there are dregs at the bottom of your sweetest cups,
          and you know it. Now, if even now you are not perfectly at peace; if
          in this land of peace wherein you have trusted you are getting weary
          of these things, then |how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?|
          Moreover, you sometimes have, if I mistake not, very strange
          apprehensions. I have known some of the most reckless sinners who have
          had fearful times, when nobody could cheer them; when a certain
          fearful looking for of judgment has haunted them. The most
          superstitious people in the world are those who are the most profane.
          It is a strange thing that there is always that weak point about those
          who seem to be most hardened. But you that are not thus hardened, you
          know that you dare not look forward to death with any pleasure -- you
          cannot; to go to the grave is never ver joyous work with you. Ay, and
          if you were certain that there could be no more death, it would be the
          best news that you have ever heard; whereas to some of us it would be
          the worst that could ever come. Ah, well! if the very thought of death
          is bitter, what will the reality be? And if to gaze at it from a
          distance is too hard a thing for your mind, what will it be to know
          that the poison is rankling in your veins? What will you do? |How wilt
          thou do in the swelling of Jordan?| Well, I shall not describe what
          you will do, though I have seen it, and you must have been dosed with
          the laudanum of self-confidence. At other times the man is awaked, and
          see the dreadful doom to which death is driving him, and starts back
          and shrinks from the wrath to come, and cries and shrieks, and perhaps
          swears that he will not die; and yet die he must, dragged down to that
          place where he must lift up his eyes to see nothing that can give him
          hope -- nothing that can take away the sharpness of his anguish. I
          leave that point. God make it a caution to many now present. Some of
          you men and women here may be nearer death than you dream of. I would
          you would answer the qestion, |How wilt thou do in the swelling of
          Jordan?|
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. But now I intend to use the question as EXCITING MEDITATION in the
          breasts of those who have given their hearts to Christ, and who
          consequently are prepared to die whenever the summons may come. Well,
          what do we mean to do, how shall we behave ourselves when we come to
          die? I sat down to try and think this matter over, but I cannot, in
          the short time allotted to me, even give you a brief view of the
          thoughts that passed through my mind. I began thus, |how shall I do in
          the swelling of Jordan?| Well, as a believer in Christ, perhaps, I may
          never come there at all, for there are some that will be alive and
          remain at the coming of the Son of Man, and these will never die. For
          so says the Apostle: |Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all
          sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of
          an eye, and the last trump.| This thought we wish to keep ever before
          us. My real hope is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. I would far
          rather see the Master return than see the messenger Death. I regulate
          my life as one who is looking for and hastening unto the coming of The
          Son of Man. I will not pay more attention to the servant than to the
          Lord of all. |Come, Lord Jesus! yea, come quickly,| is the prayer of
          our hearts continually; and as the bride of Christ, we ought to have
          our hearts filled with rapture at the thought of his return to claim
          us as his own. If he send for us, |It is well;| but best of a if he
          come himself again the second time without sin unto salvation. A sweet
          truth, which we place first in our meditation, I may not sleep, but I
          must and shall be changed. Then I thought again, |How shall I do in
          the swelling of Jordan?| I may go through it in the twinkling of an
          eye. Remember that good man, who some time ago was getting ready to
          preach as usual, but the sermon was never delivered on earth, I mean
          the President of the Wesleyan Conference; how speedily was he taken to
          his rest; and how happy it is just to close one's eyes on earth, and
          open them in heaven. Such also was the death of one of God's aged
          servants, Mr. Alleine, who had battled well for the truth. He was
          suddenly taken ill, and was advised to retire to bed. |No,| said he,
          |but I will die in my chair, and I am not afraid to die.| He sat down,
          and only had time to say, |My life is hid with Christ in God,| and he
          closed his eyes with his own hands and fell on sleep. When Ananias, a
          martyr knelt to lay his white head upon the bock, it was said to him
          as he closed his eyes to receive the stroke, |Shut thine eyes a
          little, old man, and immediately thou shalt see the light of God.| I
          could envy such a clam departing. Sudden death, sudden glory; taken
          away in Elijah's chariot of fire, with the horses driven at the rate
          of lightning, so that the spirit scarcely knows that it has left the
          clay, before it sees the brightness of the beatific vision. Well, that
          may take away some of the alarm of death, the thought that we may not
          be even a moment in the swelling of Jordan. Then again, I thought, if
          I must pass through the swelling of Jordan, yet the real act of death
          takes no time. We hear of suffering on a dying bed; the suffering is
          all connected with life, it is not death. The actual thing called
          death, as far as we know of, does not cost a pang; it is the life that
          is in us, that makes us suffer, but death gives one kind pin's-prick,
          and it is all over. Moreover, if I pass through the swelling of
          Jordan, I may do so without suffering any pain. A dying bed is
          sometimes very painful; with certain diseases, and especially with
          strong men, it is often hard for the body and soul to part asunder.
          But it has been my happy lot to see some deaths so extremely pleasing,
          that I could not help remarking, that it were worth while living, only
          for the sake of dying as some have died. We have seen consumption for
          instance; how gently it takes down the frame very often; how quietly
          the soul departs; and in old age, and debility, how easily the spirit
          seems to get away from the cage that was broken, which only needed one
          blow, and the imprisoned bird flies straight away to its eternal
          resting-place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, as I cannot tell in what physical state I may be when I
          come to die, I just tried to think again, how shall I do in the
          swelling of Jordan? I hope I shall do as others have done before me,
          who have built on the same rock, and had the same promises to be their
          succour. They cried, |Victory!| So shall I, and after that die quietly
          and in peace. If the same transporting scene may not be mine, I will
          at least lay my head upon my Saviour's bosom, and breathe my life out
          gently there. You have a right, Christian, to expect that as other
          Christians die so shall you. How will you die? Why, you will die as
          your sainted mother did; you will die as your father did; when the
          time came for the |silver cord to be loosed and the golden bowl to be
          broken, for the pitcher to be broken at the fountain and the wheel
          broken at the cistern,| the pitcher was broken and the cord loosed,
          and their spirits went to God who gave them. How will you die? Why, as
          I mused on this I took down my little book of |Promises,| for I
          thought, I shall certainly do as God says I shall. Well, how is that?
          |When thou passest through the rivers I will be with thee.| And again,
          |Though I pass through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
          no evil.| And again, |He shall swallow up death in victory.| And
          again, |he shall make all thy bed in they sickness;| and yet again,
          |Fear not, I am with thee; be not dismayed, I am thy God' I will never
          leave thee nor forsake thee.| You known what a many dying pillows God
          has made for his dear people in the hour of their departure. |How
          shall I do in the swelling of Jordan?| Why, do manfully, do patiently,
          if God shall keep his promise as we know he will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me speak to you all again -- I mean you that are in Christ.
          |How will you do in the swelling of Jordan?| Why, you will do as a man
          does who has had a long day's walk, and he can see his home. You will
          clap your hands. You will sit down upon the next milestone with the
          tears in your eyes, and wipe the sweat from your face and say, |It is
          well, it is over. Oh how happy it is to see my own roof-tree, and the
          place where my best friends, my kindred dwell. I shall soon be at home
          -- at home forever with the Lord.| How will you do? Why we will do as
          a soldier does when the battle is fought; he takes off his armor,
          stretches himself out at length to rest. The battle is all over. He
          forgets his wound, and reckons up the glory of the victory and the
          reward which follows. So will we do. We will begin to forget the
          wounds, and the garments rolled in blood, and we will think of the
          |crown of life that fadeth not away.| How will we do in the swelling
          of Jordan? We will do as men do when they launch for a foreign
          country. They look back upon those they leave behind, and wave their
          handerchiefs as long as they can get sight of them; but they are soon
          gone. And we will bid adieu to dear ones; they shall have the tears,
          but we shall have the joy, for we go to the islands of the blest, the
          land of the hereafter, the home of the sanctified, to dwell with God
          for ages. Who will weep when he starts on such a voyage, and launches
          on such a blessed sea! What will we do when we come into the swelling
          of the Jordan? Why me thinks, dear friends, we shall then begin to see
          through the veil, and to enjoy the paradise of the blessed which is
          our forever. We will make that dying bed a throne, and we will sit and
          reign there with Christ Jesus. We will think of that river Jordan as
          being one tributary of the river of life, which flows at the foot of
          the jasper throne of the Most High. We will live in the land of Beulah
          on the edge of the Jordan, with out feet in the cold stream, singing
          of the better land. We will hear the songs of angels, as celestial
          breezes bring them across the narrow stream. And sometimes we will
          have in our bosom some of the spices from the Mountains of Myrrh,
          which Christ shall give us across the river. And when we come to die,
          what will we do in the swelling of the Jordan? Why we will try and
          bear our dying testimony.
        </p>
        <p>|My joyful soul on Jordan's shore,</p>
        <p>Shall rise one Ebenezer more.|</p>
        <p>
          Oh, that was a grand thing when Joshua said to the twelve men, |Take
          up twelve stones, and set them down in the midst of Jordan where the
          priest's feet stood still, and take up twelve other stones and set
          them up on the other side of the Jordan, when the children of Israel
          first trod the promised shore.| You and I will do this, we will leave
          twelve stones in the midst of Jordan. They shall tell our friends and
          kindred here of the good works we said, the adieux we gave them, and
          the joyful hopes which cheered us, the song we sang when death began
          to stay our throat. And then we will raise another Ebenezer in heaven.
          There shall by twelve stones there that will tell the angels and the
          principalities, of the love which cleft the Jordan, and brought us
          through it as on dry land. This is how we will do in the swelling of
          the Jordan. We are not looking forward to death with any fear, with
          any dread. When we get home tonight, we shall begin to take off our
          garments one by one. We shall not shed a tear. Nor shall we when we
          come to die.
        </p>
        <p>|Since Jesus is mine, I will not fear undressing,</p>
        <p>But gladly put off these garments of clay;</p>
        <p>To die in the Lord is a comfort and blessing,</p>
        <p>Since Jesus to glory thro' death led the way.|</p>
        <p>
          This is how we shall do in the swelling of the Jordan. Take off our
          garments to put on celestial robes. As the bridegroom longeth for the
          marriage day, and as the bride waiteth until she is joined unto her
          husband in wedlock, even so our spirits wait for God. As the exile
          panteth to be delivered, and the galley-slave to be separated from his
          oar, so wait we to be set free for glory and immortality. As she that
          mourns her absent lord pines for his return, as the child longeth to
          reach his father's house and to see his father's face, so do we.
        </p>
        <p>|My heart is with him on his throne,</p>
        <p>And ill can brook delay,</p>
        <p>Each moment listening for his voice,</p>
        <p>'Make haste and come away.'|</p>
        <p>
          I must finish, for time has gone. But I meant to have said a word or
          two by way of warning. I can only do so now briefly, abridging them
          and compressing the thoughts as tightly as I can. |How wilt thou do in
          the swelling of Jordan?| may be well used by way of warning. I think,
          dear friends, you ought to ask yourselves one question. Some of you
          never think of dying, and yet you should. You say you may live long:
          you may, and you may not. If there were a great number of loaves upon
          this table, and you were to eat one every day; if you were told that
          one of those loaves had poison in it, I think you would begin every
          one with great caution; and knowing that one of them would be your
          death, you would take each up with silent dread. No you have so many
          days, and in one of those days there is the poison death. I do not
          know which one. It may be tomorrow; it may not be until many a day has
          gone. But I think you ought to handle all your days with holy
          jealousy. Is not that a fair parable? If it be, then let me ask you to
          think upon the question, |How wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?|
          You grant that you will die, and you may die soon. Is not foolish to
          be living in this world without a thought of what you will do last? A
          man goes into an inn, and as soon as he sits down he begins to order
          his wine, his dinner, his bed; there is no delicacy in season which he
          forgets to bespeak, there is no luxury which he denies himself. He
          stops at the inn for some time. By-and-by there comes in a bill, and
          he says, |Oh, I never thought of that -- I never though of that!|
          |Why,| says the landlord, |here is a man who is either a born fool or
          else a knave. What! Never though of the reckoning -- never thought of
          settling-day!| And yet this how some of you live. You have this, and
          that, and the other thing in the world's inn (for it is nothing but an
          inn), and you have soon to go your own way, and yet you have never
          thought of settling-day! |Well, says one, |I was casting up my
          accounts this morning.| Yes, I remember a minister making this remark
          when he heard of one that cast up his accounts on Sunday. He said, |I
          hope that is not true sir.| |Yes,| he said, |I do cast up my accounts
          on Sunday.| |Ah, well,| he said, |the day of judgment will be spent in
          a similar manner -- in casting up accounts, and it will go ill with
          those people who found no other time in which to serve themselves
          except the time which was given them that they serve God.| You have
          either been a dishonest man, or else you must be supremely foolish, to
          be spending every day in this world's inn, and yet to be ignoring the
          thought of the great day of account. But remember, though you forget
          it, God forgets not. Every day is adding to the score. Photographed in
          heaven is every action that you perform. Your very thoughts are
          photographed upon the eternal mind; and in the day when the book shall
          be opened it will go ill with you. Perhaps you will say, as one did in
          the Book of Kings, |Well, I was busy here and there|, |I was looking
          after my family and my property; I was looking after politics; I was
          seeing after such-and-such an investment; and my soul is gone.| Yes
          but that would not bring it back again. And what shall it profit you,
          though you gain the whole world and lose your own soul. It is no
          business of mine what becomes of you, except this, that I do desire so
          to talk with you at all times, that if you perish it may be laid at my
          door. What would you say to that soldier who should be told by his
          commanding officer to fight with the foe on the field of battle, and
          the so-called soldier were to reply, |I don't know anything about
          battle or fighting; I never thought of the battle field, I can do
          anything but fight!| The general would be sorely amazed. He would want
          to know what the soldier lived for, if it were not to fight and defend
          his country in the hour of his country's need. What do we live for, if
          it is not to prepare for a hereafter life, and for the day for which
          all days were made? What, are we sent into this world and told that we
          are to |prepare to meet our God,| and we do everything else but the
          one thing: this will not be wise; and when the Lord of the whole earth
          shall come out of his place to judge the sons of men, bitterly shall
          we rue our folly. Be wise now, remember this, and consider your latter
          end. What words shall I use to urge you to consider the subject and
          take my warning. Is heaven a place you would like to enter? Is hell a
          place you would like to avoid, or will you make your bed in it
          forever? Are you in love with eternal misery that you run to it so
          madly? Oh, stop; turn ye! Turn ye! Why will ye die? I do pray you stop
          and consider. Consideration does no man harm. Second thoughts here are
          for the best. Think and think, and think again, and oh, may God lead
          you, through thinking to feel you danger, and may you then accept that
          gracious remedy which is in Christ Jesus; for whosoever believeth in
          him is not condemned, whosoever trusts in Christ is saved. Sin is
          forgiven, the soul is accepted, the spirit is blessed the moment if
          trusts the Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I close the subject, I must guide your thoughts to what is the
          true preparation for death. Three things present themselves to my mind
          as being our duty in connection with the dying hour. First seek to be
          washed in the Red Sea of the dear Redeemer's blood, come in contact
          with the death of Christ, and by faith in it you will be prepared to
          meet your own. Without giving an opinion upon the merit of that system
          of medicine which professes to cure diseases by producing an effect
          upon the system akin to the original malady, or as they put it, |like
          curing like,| we recommend it in spiritual things; come into union
          with Christ's death, and that will take away the evil and sting of
          your own. Be buried with him in baptism unto death, and have part with
          him in the reality symbolized in that blest ordinance, and you will
          not dread Jordan's swellings, if in the full tide of the Redeemer's
          blood has rolled over you, so that you are washed and clean. If guilt
          be on your conscience, it will be as a millstone round your neck and
          you will sink to endless woe; but if the love of Jesus be in your
          heart, it will buoy up your head and keep you safe, so that although
          heart and flesh fail you, you will have God to be the strength of your
          heart and your portion for ever. Again, learn of the Apostle Paul to
          |die daily.| Practise the duty of self-denial and mortifying of the
          flesh till it shall become a habit with you, and when you have to lay
          down the flesh and part with everything, you will be only continuing
          the course of life you have pursued all alone. No wonder if dying
          should prove hard work if you are completely unused to it in thought
          and expectation. If death comes to me as a stranger, I may be
          startled, but if I have prepared myself to receive him, he may come
          and knock at my door and I shall say, |I am ready to go with you, for
          I have been expecting you all my life.| How beautiful this expression
          of the Apostle, |I am ready to be offered up and the time of my
          departure is at hand.| He was waiting for death as for a friend, and
          when it came, I am sure he was well pleased to go. He tells us he had
          |a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better.| Even
          so may we learn to look at the time when we shall hear the summons,
          |Come up higher,| as to a time to be longer for rather than dreaded.
          Learn to submit you will to God's will daily. Learn to endure hardness
          as a good soldier of the cross, so that when the last conflict comes
          it may find you able by the grace of God to bear the brunt of the
          final contest with unflinching courage. And as the last preparation of
          the end of life, I should advise a continual course of active service
          and obedience to the command of God. I have frequently thought that no
          happier place to die in could be found that one's post of duty. If I
          were a soldier, I think I should like to die as Wolfe died, with
          victory shouting in my ear, or as Nelson died in the midst of his
          greatest success. Preparation for death does not mean going alone into
          the chamber and retiring from the world, but active service, |doing
          the duty of the day in the day.| The best preparation for sleep, the
          healthiest soporific, is hard work, and one of the best things to
          prepare us for sleeping in Jesus, is to live in him an active life of
          going about doing good. The attitude in which I wish death to find me
          is, with light trimmed, and loins girt, waiting and watching; at work,
          doing my allotted task, and multiplying my talent for the master's
          glory. Idlers may not anticipate rest, but workers will not be
          unwilling to welcome the hour which shall hear the words, |It is
          finished.| Keep your eye upon the recompense of the reward. Lay up
          treasures in heaven, and thus will you be ready to cross the stream
          and enter the loved land, whither heart and treasure have gone
          beforehand, to prepare the way. Washed in the blood of Christ,
          accustomed to submit to whatever God wills, and to find our pleasure
          in doing his will on earth as we hope to do it in heaven, joined to a
          life of holy service, and I am persuaded that we shall be prepared
          with one of old to say, |I have fought a good fight, I have finished
          my course, I have kept the faith,| and with him, calmly and joyfully
          to anticipate the crown which fadeth not away. God bring you to this
          point, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.
