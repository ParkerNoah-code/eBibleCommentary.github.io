        <p>Two Scholia on Genesis XXII.13.</p>
        <p>
          The Syriac and the Hebrew use the word |suspended,| as more clearly
          typifying the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word Sabek some have rendered remission, others upright, as if the
          meaning, agreeing with the popular belief, were -- a goat walking
          erect up to a bush, and there standing erect caught by his horns, so
          as to be a plain type of the cross. For this reason it is not
          translated, because the single Hebrew word signifies in other
          languages many things. To those, however, who ask it is proper to give
          an answer, and to say that Sabek denotes lifted up. <br />
