        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.411)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, September 29th, 1861 by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well| -- 2 Kings
          4:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE SUBJECT of this morning's discourse will be |Infant Salvation.| It
          may not possibly be interesting to all present, but I do not remember
          to have preached upon this subject to this congregation, and I am
          anxious moreover that the printed series should contain sermons upon
          the whole range of theology. I think there is no one point which ought
          to be left out in our ministry, even though it may only yield comfort
          to a class. Perhaps the larger proportion of this audience have at
          some time or other had to shed the briny tear over the child's little
          coffin; -- it may be that through this subject consolation may be
          afforded to them. This good Shunammite was asked by Gehazi, whether it
          was well with herself. She was mourning over a lost chid, and yet she
          said, |It is well;| she felt that the trial would surely be blessed.
          |Is it well with thy husband?| He was old and stricken in years, and
          was ripening for death, yet she said, |Yes, it is well.| Then came the
          question about her child, it was dead at home, and the enquiry would
          renew her griefs, |Is it well with the child?| Yet she said, |It is
          well,| perhaps so answering because she had a faith that soon it
          should be restored to her, and that its temporary absence was well; or
          I think rather because she was persuaded that whatever might have
          become of its spirit, it was safe in the keeping of God, happy beneath
          the shadow of his wings. Therefore, not fearing that it was lost,
          having no suspicion whatever that it was cast away from the place of
          bliss -- for that suspicion would have quite prevented her giving such
          answer -- she said |Yes, the child is dead, but it is well.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let every mother and father here present know assuredly that it
          is well with the child, if God hath taken it away from you in its
          infant days. You never heard its declaration of faith -- it was not
          capable of such a thing -- it was not baptized into the Lord Jesus
          Christ, not buried with him in baptism; it was not capable of giving
          that |answer of a good conscience towards God;| nevertheless, you may
          rest assured that it is well with the child, well in a higher and a
          better sense than it is well with yourselves; well without limitation,
          well without exception, well infinitely, |well| eternally. Perhaps you
          will say, |What reasons have we for believing that it is well with the
          child?| Before I enter upon that I would make one observation. It has
          been wickedly, lyingly, and slanderously said of Calvinists, that we
          believe that some little children perish. Those who make the
          accusation know that their charge is false. I cannot even dare to
          hope, though I would wish to do so, that they ignorantly misrepresent
          us. They wickedly repeat what has been denied a thousand times, what
          they know is not true. In Calvin's advice to Omit, he interprets the
          second commandment |shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love
          me,| as referring to generations, and hence he seems to teach that
          infants who have had pious ancestors, no matter how remotely, dying as
          infants are saved. This would certainly take in the whole race. As for
          modern Calvinists, I know of no exception, but we all hope and believe
          that all persons dying in infancy are elect. Dr. Gill, who has been
          looked upon in late times as being a very standard of Calvinism, not
          to say of ultra-Calvinism, himself never hints for a moment the
          supposition that any infant has perished, but affirms of it that it is
          a dark and mysterious subject, but that it is his belief, and he
          thinks he has Scripture to warrant it, that they who have fallen
          asleep in infancy have not perished, but have been numbered with the
          chosen of God, and so have entered into eternal rest. We have never
          taught the contrary, and when the charge is brought, I repudiate it
          and say, |You may have said so, we never did, and you know we never
          did. If you dare to repeat the slander again, let the lie stand in
          scarlet on your very cheek if you be capable of a blush.| We have
          never dreamed of such a thing. With very few and rare exceptions, so
          rare that I never heard of them except from the lips of slanderers, we
          have never imagined that infants dying as infants have perished, but
          we have believed that they enter into the paradise of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, this morning, I shall endeavor to explain the way in
          which we believed infants are saved; secondly, give reasons for do
          believing; and then, thirdly, seek to bring out a practical use of the
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>I. First of all, THE WAY IN WHICH WE BELIEVE INFANTS TO BE SAVED.</p>
        <p>
          Some ground the idea of the eternal blessedness of the infant upon its
          innocence. We do no such thing; we believe that the infant fell in the
          first Adam, |for in Adam all died.| All Adam's posterity, whether
          infant or adult, were represented by him -- he stood for them all, and
          when he fell, he fell for them all. There was no exception made at all
          in the covenant of works made with Adam as to infants dying; and
          inasmuch as they were included in Adam, though they have not sinned
          after the similitude of Adam's transgression, they have original
          guilt. They are |born in sin and steepen in iniquity; in sin do their
          mothers conceive them;| so saith David of himself, and (by inference)
          of the whole human race. If they be saved, we believe it is not
          because of any natural innocence. They enter heaven by the very same
          way that we do; they are receives in the name of Christ. |Other
          foundation can no man lay than that which is laid,| and I do not think
          nor dream that there is a different foundation for the infant than
          that which is laid for the adult. And equally is it far from our minds
          to believe that infants go to heaven through baptism -- not to say, in
          the first place, that we believe infant sprinkling to be a human and
          carnal invention, an addition to the Word of God, and therefore wicked
          and injurious. When we reflect that it is rendered into some thing
          worse than superstition by being accompanied with falsehood, when
          children are taught that in their baptism they are made the children
          of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, which is as base a
          lie as ever was forged in hell, or uttered beneath the copes of
          heaven, our spirit sinks at the fearful errors which have crept into
          the Church, through the one little door of infant sprinkling. No;
          children are not saved because they are baptized, for if so, the
          Puseyite is quite right in refusing to bury our little children if
          they die unbaptized. Yes, the barbarian is quite right in driving the
          parent, as he does to this day, from the church yard of his own
          national Church, and telling him that his child may rot above-ground,
          and that it shall not be buried except it be at the dead of night,
          because the superstitious drops have never fallen on its brow. He is
          right enough if that baptism made the child a Christian, and if that
          child could not be saved without it. But a thing so revolting to
          feeling, is at once to be eschewed by Christian men. The child is
          saved, if snatched away by death as we are, on another ground than
          that of rites and ceremonies, and the will of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          On what ground, then, do we believe the child to be saved? We believe
          it to be as lost on the rest of mankind, and as truly condemned by the
          sentence which said, |In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
          surely die.| It is saved because it is elect. In the compass of
          election, in the Lamb's Book of Life, we believe there shall be found
          written millions of souls who are only shown on earth, and then
          stretch their wings for heaven. They are saved, too, because they were
          redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. He who shed his blood
          for all his people, bought them with the same price with which he
          redeemed their parents, and therefore are they saved because Christ
          was sponsor for them, and suffered in their room and stead. They are
          saved, again not without regeneration, for, |except a man| -- the text
          does not mean an adult man but a person, a being of the human race --
          |except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.| No
          doubt, in some mysterious manner the Spirit of God regenerates the
          infant soul, and it enters into glory made meet to be a partaker of
          the inheritance of the saints in light. That this is possible is
          proved from Scripture instances. John the Baptist was filled with the
          Holy Ghost from his mother's would. We read of Jeremiah also, that the
          same had occurred to him; and of Samuel we find that while yet a babe
          the Lord called him. We believe, therefore, that even before the
          intellect can work, God, who worketh not by the will of man, nor by
          blood, but by the mysterious agency of his Holy Spirit, creates the
          infant soul a new creature in Christ Jesus, and then it enters into
          the |rest which remaineth for the people of God.| By election, by
          redemption, by regeneration, the child enters into glory, by the
          selfsame door by which every believer in Christ Jesus hopes to enter,
          and in no other way. If we could not suppose that children could be
          saved in the same way as adults, if it would be necessary to suppose
          that God's justice must be infringe, or that his plan of salvation
          must be altered to suit their cases, then we should be in doubt; but
          we can see that with the same appliances, by the same plan, on
          precisely the same grounds, and through the same agencies, the infant
          soul can behold the Savior a face in glory everlasting, and therefore
          we are at ease upon the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me now to note THE REASONS WHY WE THUS THINK INFANTS
          ARE SAVED.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we ground our conviction very much upon the goodness of the
          nature of God. We say that the opposite doctrine that some infants
          perish and are lost, is altogether repugnant to the idea which we have
          of Him whose name is love. If we had a God, whose name was Moloch, if
          God were an arbitrary tyrant, without benevolence or grace, we could
          suppose some infants being cast into hell; but our God, who heareth
          the young ravens when they cry, certainly will find no delight in the
          shrieks and cries of infants cast away from his presence. We read of
          him that he is so tender, that he careth for oxen, that he would not
          have the mouth of the ox muzzled, that treadeth out the corn. Nay, he
          careth for the bird upon the nest, and would not have the mother bird
          killed while sitting upon its nest with its little ones. He made
          ordinances and commands even for irrational creatures. He finds food
          for the most loathsome animal, nor does he neglect the worm any more
          than the angel, and shall we believe with such universal goodness as
          this, that he would cast away the infant soul I say it would he clear
          contrary to all that we have ever read or ever believed of Him, that
          our faith would stagger before a revelation which should display a
          fact so singularly exceptional to the tenor of his other deeds. We
          have learned humbly to submit our judgments to his will, and we dare
          not criticise or accuse the Lord of All; we believe him to be just,
          let him do as he may, and? Therefore, whatever he might reveal we
          would accept; but he never has, and I think he never will require of
          us so desperate a stretch of faith as to see goodness in the eternal
          misery of an infinite cast into hell. You remember when Jonah --
          petulant, quick-tempered Jonah -- would have Nineveh perish God gave
          it as the reason why Nineveh should not be destroyed, that there were
          in it more than six score thousand infants, -- persons, he said, who
          knew not their light hand tram their left. If he spared Nineveh that
          their mortal life might be spared, think you that their immortal souls
          shall be needlessly cast away! I only put it to your own reason. It is
          not a case where we need much argument. Would your God cast away an
          infant? If yours could, I am happy to say he is not the God that I
          adore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we think it would be inconsistent utterly with the known
          character of our Lord Jesus Christ. When his disciples put away the
          little children whom their anxious mothers brought to him, Jesus said,
          |Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not for
          of such is the kingdom of heaven,| by which he taught, as John Newton
          very properly says, that such as these made up a very great part of
          the kingdom of heaven. And when we consider that upon the best
          statistics it is calculated that more than one third of the human race
          die in infancy, and probably if we take into calculation those
          districts where infanticide prevails, as in heathen countries, such as
          China and the like, perhaps one half of the population of the world
          die before they reach adult years, -- the saying of the Savior derives
          great force indeed,| Of such is the kingdom of heaven.| If some remind
          me that the kingdom of heaven means the dispensation of grace on
          earth, I answer, yes, it does, and it means the same dispensation in
          heaven too, for while part of the kingdom of heaven is on earth in the
          Church, since the Church is always one, that other part of the Church
          which is above is also the kingdom of heaven. We know this text is
          constantly used as a proof of baptism, but in the first place, Christ
          did not baptize them, for |Jesus Christ baptized not;| in the second
          place, his disciples did not baptize them, for they withstood their
          coming, and would have driven them away. Then if Jesus did not, and
          his disciple did not, who did,' It has no more to do with baptism than
          with circumcision. There is not the slightest allusion to baptism in
          the text, or in the context; and I can prove the circumcision of
          infants from it with quite as fair logic as others attempt to prove
          infant baptism. However, it does prove this, that infants compose a
          great part of the family of Christ, and that Jesus Christ is known to
          have had a love and amiableness towards the little ones. When they
          shouted in the temple, |Hosanna!| did he rebuke them? No; but rejoiced
          in their boyish shouts. |Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hath
          God ordained strength,| and does not that text seem to say that in
          heaven there shall be |perfect praise| rendered to God by multitudes
          of cherubs who were here on earth -- your little ones fondled in your
          bosom -- and then suddenly snatched away to heaven. I could not
          believe it of Jesus, that he would say to little children, |Depart, ye
          accursed, into everlasting fire in hell!| I cannot conceive it
          possible of him as the loving and tender one, that when he shall sit
          to judge all nations, he should put the little ones on the left hand,
          and should banish them for ever from his presence. Could he address
          them, and say to them, |I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I
          was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink, sick, and in prison, and ye
          visited me not? |How could they do it? And if the main reason of
          damnation lie in sins of omission like there which it was not possible
          for them to commit, for want of power to perform the duty how, then,
          shall he condemn and cast them away?
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we think that the ways of grace, if we consider them,
          render it highly improbable, not to say impossible, that an infant
          soul should be destroyed. What saith Scripture? |Where sin abounded,
          grace did much more abound.| Such a thing as that could not be sail of
          an infant cast away. We know that God is so abundantly gracious that
          such expressions as the |unsearchable riches of Christ,| |God who is
          rich in mercy,| |A God full of compassion,| |The exceeding riches of
          his grace,| and the like are truly applicable without exaggeration or
          hyperbole. We know that he is good to all, and his tender mercies are
          over all his works, and that in grace he is able to do |exceeding
          abundantly above what we can ask or even think.| The grace of God has
          sought out in the world the greatest sinners. It has not passed by the
          vilest of the vile. He who called himself the chief of sinners was a
          partaker of the love of Christ. All manner of sin and of blasphemy
          have been forgiven unto man. He has been able to save unto the
          uttermost them that come unto God by Christ, and dons it seem
          consistent with such grace as this that it should pass by the myriads
          upon myriads of little ones, who wear the image of the earthy Adam,
          and never stamp upon them the image of the heavenly? I cannot conceive
          such a thing. He that has tasted and felt, and handled the grace of
          God, will, I think, shrink instinctively from any other doctrine than
          this, that infants dying such, are most assuredly saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again one of the strongest inferential arguments is to be found
          in the fact that Scripture positively states that the number of saved
          souls at the last will be very great. In the Revelation we read of a
          number that no man can number. The Psalmist speaks of them as numerous
          as dew drops from the womb of the morning. Many passages give to
          Abraham, as the father of the faithful, a seed as many as the stars of
          heaven, or as the sand on the sea shore. Christ is to see of the
          travail of his soul and be satisfied; surely it is not a little that
          will satisfy him. The virtue of the precious redemption involves a
          great host who were redeemed. All Scripture seems to tenon that heaven
          will not be a narrow world, that its population will not be like a
          handful gleaned out of a vintage, but that Christ shall be glorified
          by ten thousand times ten thousand, whom he hath redeemed with his
          blood. Now where are they to come from? How small a part of the map
          could be called Christian! Look at it. Out of that part which could be
          called Christian, how small a portion of them would bear the name of
          believer! How few could be said to have even a nominal attachment to
          the Church of Christ? Out of this, how many are hypocrites, and know
          not the truth! I do not see it possible, unless indeed the millennium
          age should soon come, and then far exceed a thousand years, I do not
          see how it is possible that so vast a number should enter heaven,
          unless it be on the supposition that infant souls constitute the great
          majority. It is a sweet belief to my own mind that there will be more
          saved than lost, for in all things Christ is to have the pre-eminence,
          and why not in this? It was the thought of a great divine that perhaps
          at the last the number of the lost would not bear a greater proportion
          to the number of the saved, than do the number of criminals in gaols
          to those who are abroad in a properly-conducted state. I hope it may
          be found to be so. At any rate, it is not my business to be asking,
          |Lord, are there few that shall be saved?| The gate is strait, but the
          Lord knows how to bring thousands through it without making it any
          wider, and we ought not to seek to shut any out by seeking to make it
          narrower. Oh! I do know that Christ will have the victory, and that as
          he is followed by streaming hosts, the black prince of hell will never
          be able to count so many followers in his dreary train as Christ in
          his resplendent triumph. And if so we must have the children saved;
          yea, brethren, if not so, we must have them, because we feel anyhow
          they must be numbered with the blessed, and dwell with Christ
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for one or two incidental matters which occur in Scripture, which
          seem to throw a little light also on the subject. You have not
          forgotten the case of David. His child by Bathsheba was to die as a
          punishment for the father's offense. David prayed, and fasted, and
          vexed his soul; at last they tell him the child is dead. He fasted no
          more, but he said, |I shall go to him, he shall not return to me.|
          Now, where did David expect to go to? Why, to heaven surely. Then his
          child must bays been there, for he said, |I shall go to him.| I do not
          hear him say the same of Absalom. He did not stand over his corpse,
          and say, |I shall go to him;| he had no hope for that rebellious son.
          Over this child it was not -- |O my son! would to God I had died for
          thee!| No, he could let this babe go with perfect confidence, for he
          said, |I shall go to him.| |I know,| he might have said, |that He hath
          made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure,
          and when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear
          no evil, for he is with me, I shall go to my child, and in heaven we
          shall be re-united with each other.| You remember, his, those
          instances which I have already quoted, where children are said to have
          been sanctified from the comb. It casts this light upon the subject,
          it shows it not to be impossible that a child should be a partaker of
          grace while yet a babe. Then you have the passage, |Out of the mouths
          of babes and sucklings he hath perfected praise.| The coming out of
          Egypt was a type of the redemption of the chosen seed, and you know
          that in that case the little ones were to go forth, nay, not even a
          hoof was to be left behind. Why not children in the greater
          deliverance to join in the song of Moses and of the Lamb? And there is
          a passage in Ezekiel, for where we have but little, we must pick up
          even the crumbs, and do as our Master did -- gather up the fragments
          that nothing be lost -- there is a passage in Ezekiel, sixteenth
          chapter, twenty-first verse, where God is censuring his people for
          having given up their little infants to Moloch, having caused them to
          pass through the fire, and he says of these little ones, |Thou hast
          slain lay children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through
          the fire,| so, then, they were God's children those little ones who
          died in the red-hot arms of Moloch while babes, God calls |my
          children.| We may, therefore, believe concerning all those who have
          fallen asleep in these early days of life, that Jesus said of them,
          |These are my children,| and that he now to-day, while he leads his
          sheep unto loving fountains of water, does not forget still to carry
          out his own injunction, |Feed my lambs.| Yea, to-day even he carrieth
          |the lambs in his bosom,| and even before the eternal throne he is not
          ashamed to say, |Behold I and the children whom thou hast given me.|
          There is another passage in Scripture which I think may be used. In
          the first chapter of Deuteronomy these ball been a threatening
          pronounced upon the children of Israel in the wilderness, that, with
          the exception of Caleb and Joshua, they should never see the promised
          land; nevertheless, it is added. |Your little ones, which ye said
          should be a prey and your children, which in that day had no knowledge
          between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I
          give it, and they shall possess it.| To you, fathers and mothers who
          fear not God, who live and die unbelieving, I would say, your unbelief
          cannot shut your children out of heaven and I bless God for that.
          While you cannot lay hold on that text which says |The promise is unto
          us and our children, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call,|
          yet inasmuch as the sin of the generation in the wilderness did not
          shut the next generation out of Canaan but they did surely enter in,
          so the sin of unbelieving parents shall not necessarily be the ruin of
          their children, but they shall still, through God's sovereign grace
          and his overflowing mercy, be made partakers of the rest which he hath
          reserved for his people. Understand that this morning I have not made
          a distinction between the children of godly and ungodly parents. If
          they die in infancy, I do not mind who is father nor who their mother,
          they are saved; I do not even endorse the theory of a good
          Presbyterian minister who supposes that the children of godly parents
          will have a better place in heaven than those who happen to be sprung
          from ungodly ones. I do not believe in any such thing. I am not
          certain that there are any degrees in heaven at an; and even if there
          were, I am not clear that even that would prove our children to have
          any higher rights than others. All of them without exception, from
          whosoever loins they may have sprung, will, we believe, not by
          baptism, not by their parents' faith, but simply as we are all saved
          through the election of God, through the precious blood |Christ,
          through the regenerating influence of the Holy Spirit, attain to glory
          and Immortality, and wear the image of the heavenly as they have worn
          the image of the earthy.
        </p>
        <p>III. I now come to make a PRACTICAL USE OF THE DOCTRINE.</p>
        <p>
          First, let it be a comfort to bereaved parents. You say it is a heavy
          cross that you have to carry. Remember, it is easier to carry a dead
          cross than a living one. To have a living cross is indeed a
          tribulation, -- to have a child who is rebellious in his childhood,
          vicious in his youth, debauched in his manhood! Ah, would God that he
          had died from the birth; would God that he had never seen the light!
          Many a father's heirs have been brought with sorrow to the grave
          through his living childre, but I think never through his dead babes,
          certainly not if he were a Christian, and were able to take the
          comfort of the apostle's words -- |We sorrow not as they that are
          without hope.| So you would have your child live? Ah, if you could
          have drawn aside the veil of destiny, and have seen to what he might
          have lived! Would you have had him live to ripen for the gallows?
          Would you have him live to curse his father's God? Would you have him
          live to make your home wretched to make you wet your pillow with
          tears, and send you to your daily work with your hands upon your loins
          because of sorrow? Such might have been the case; it is not so now,
          for your little one sings before the throne of God. Do you know from
          what sorrows your little one has escaped? You have had enough
          yourself. It was born of woman, it would have been of few days and
          full of trouble as you are. It has escaped those sorrows, do you
          lament that? Remember, too your own sins, and the deep sorrow of
          repentance. Had that child lived, it would have been a sinner, and it
          must have known the bitterness of conviction of sin. It has escaped
          that; it rejoices now in the glory of God. Then would you have it back
          again? Bereaved parents, could you for a moment see your own offspring
          above, I think you would very speedily wipe away your team. There
          among the sweet voices which sing the perpetual carol may be heard the
          voice of your own child -- an angel now, and you the mother of a
          songster before the throne of God. You might not have murmured had you
          received the promise that your child should have been elevated to the
          peerage, it has been elevated higher than that -- to the peerage of
          heaven. It has received the dignity of the immortals, it is robed in
          better than royal garments it is more rich and more blessed than it
          could have been if all the crowns of earth could have been put upon
          its head. Wherefore, then would you complain? An old poet has penned a
          verse well fitted for an infant's epitaph; --
        </p>
        <p>|Short was my life, the longer is my rest,</p>
        <p>God takes those soonest whom he loveth best,</p>
        <p>Who's born today, and dies tomorrow,</p>
        <p>Loses some hours of joy, but months of sorrow.</p>
        <p>Other diseases often come to grieve us,</p>
        <p>Death restrikes but once, and that stroke doth relieve us.|</p>
        <p>
          Your child has had that one stroke and has been relieved from all
          these pains, and you may say of it, this much we know, he is supremely
          blessed, has escaped from sin, and care, and woe, and with the Savior
          rests. |Happy the babe,| says Hervey, |who,
        </p>
        <p>Privileged by faith, a shorter labor and a lighter weight,</p>
        <p>Received but yesterday the gift of breath,</p>
        <p>Ordered tomorrow to return to death.|</p>
        <p>While another says, looking upward to the skies,</p>
        <p>|O blest exchange, O envied lot,</p>
        <p>Without a conflict crowned,</p>
        <p>Stranger to pain, in pleasure bless'd</p>
        <p>And without fame, renowned.|</p>
        <p>
          So is it. It is well to fight and will, but to will as fairly without
          the fight! It is well to sing the song of triumph after we have passed
          the Red Sea with all its terrors, but to sing the song without the sea
          is glorious still! I do not know that I would prefer the lot of a
          child in heaven myself. I think it is nobler to have borne the storm,
          and to have struggled against the wind and the rain. I think it will
          be a subject of congratulation through eternity, for you and me, that
          we did not come so easy a way to heaven, for it is only a pin's prick
          after all, this mortal life; then there is exceeding great glory
          hereafter. But yet I think we may still thank God for those little
          ones that they have been spared our sins, and spared our infirmities,
          and spared our pains and are entered into the rest above. Thus saith
          the Lord unto thee, O Rachel, if thou weepest for thy children, and
          refuseth to be comforted because they are not: |Restrain thy voice
          from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be
          rewarded with the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the
          enemy.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The next and perhaps more useful and profitable inference to be drawn
          from the text is this: many of you are parents who have children in
          heaven. Is it not a desirable thing that you should go there, too? And
          yet have I not in these galleries and in this area some, perhaps many,
          who have no hope hereafter? In fact, you have left that which is
          beyond the grave to be thought of another day, you have given all your
          time and thoughts to the short, brief, and unsatisfactory pursuits of
          mortal life. Mother unconverted mother, from the battlements of heaven
          your child beckons you to Paradise. Father, ungodly, impenitent
          father, the little eyes that one -- looked joyously on you, look down
          upon you now, and the lips which had scarcely learned to call you
          father, ere they were sealed by the silence of death, may be heard as
          with a still small voice, saying to you this morning, |Father, must we
          be for ever divided by the great gulf which no man can pass? |Doth not
          nature itself put a kind of longing in your soul that you may be bound
          in the bundle of life with your own children? Then stop and think. As
          you are at present, you cannot hope for that; for your way is sinful,
          you have forgotten Christ, you have not repented of sin, you have
          loved the wages of iniquity I pray thee go to thy chamber this morning
          and think of thyself as being driven from thy little ones, banished
          for ever from the presence of God, cast |where their worm dieth not
          and where their fire is not quenched.| If thou wilt think of these
          matters, perhaps the heart will begin to move, and the eyes may begin
          to flow, and then may the Holy Spirit put before thine eyes the cross
          of the Savior the holy child Jesus! And remember, if thou wilt turn
          thine eye to him thou shalt live: if thou believest on him with all
          thy heart thou shalt be with him where He is, -- with all those whom
          the Father gave him who have gone before Thou needest not to be shut
          out. Wilt thou sign thine own doom, and write thine own death warrant?
          Neglect not this great salvation but may the grace of God work with
          thee to make thee seek, for thou shalt find -- to make thee knock, for
          the door shall be opened -- to make thee ask, for he that asketh shall
          receive! O might I take you by the hand -- perhaps you have come from
          a newly-made grave, or left the child at home dead, and God has made
          me a messenger to you this morning; O might I take you by the hand and
          say, |We cannot bring him back again, the spirit is gone beyond
          recall, but you may follow!| Behold the ladder of light before you!
          The first step upon it is repentance, out of thyself the next step is
          faith, into, Christ, and when thou art there, thou art fairly and
          safely on thy way, and ere long thou shalt be received at heaven's
          gates by those very little ones who have gone before, that they may
          come to welcome thee when thou shouldest land upon the eternal chores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet another lesson of instruction, and I will not detain you much
          longer. What shall we say to parent who have living children? We have
          spoken of those that are dead, what shall we say of the living? I
          think I might say, reserve your tears, bereaved parents, for the
          children that live. You may go to the little grave, you may look upon
          it and say, |This my child is saved; it resteth for ever beyond all
          fear of harm.| You may come back to those who are sitting round your
          table, and you can look from one to the other and say, |These my
          children, many of them are unsaved.| Out of God, out of Christ, some
          of them are just ripening into manhood and into womanhood, and you can
          plainly see that their heart is like every natural heart, desperately
          wicked. There is subject for weeping for you. I pray you never cease
          to weep for them until they have ceased to sin, never cease to hope
          for them until they have ceased to live; never cease to pray for them
          until you yourself cease to breathe. Carry them before God in the arms
          of faith, and do not be desponding because they are not what you want
          them to be. They will be won yet if you have but faith in God. Do not
          think that it is hopeless. He that saved you can save them. Take them
          one by one constantly to God's mercy-seat and wrestle with Him, and
          say, |I will not let thee go except thou bless me.| The promise is
          unto you and to your child, even to as many as the Lord your God shall
          call. Pray, strive, wrestle, and it shall yet be your happy lot to see
          your household saved. This was the word which the apostle gave to the
          gaoler, |Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and
          thy house.| We have had many proofs of it, for in this pool under here
          I have baptised not only the father and the mother, but in many cases
          all the children too, who one after another have been brought by grace
          even to put their trust in Jesus. It should be the longing of every
          parent's heart to see all his offspring Christ's, and all that have
          sprung from his loins numbered in the host of those who shall sing
          around the throne of God. We may pray in faith, for we have a promise
          about it; we may pray in faith, for we have many precedents in
          Scripture, the God of Abraham is the God of Isaac and the God of
          Jacob, but for this good thing he will be inquired of by the House of
          Israel to do it for them. Inquire of Him, plead with Him, go before
          Him with the power of faith and earnestness, and He will surely hear
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One word to all the congregation. A little child was saying the other
          day -- and children will sometimes say strange things -- |Papa, I
          cannot go back again.| When he was asked what he meant, he explained
          that he was here, he had begun his life, and it seemed such a thought
          to him that he could not cease to be, -- he could not go back again.
          You and I may say the same; here we are; we have grown up, we cannot
          go back again to that childhood in which we once were; we have
          therefore no door of escape there. Good John Bunyan used to wish that
          he had died when he was a child. Then again, he hoped he might be
          descended from some Jew, for he had a notion that the Hebrews might be
          saved. That door God has closed. Every door is closed to you and me
          except the one that is just in front of us, and that has the mark of
          the cross upon it. There is the golden knocker of prayer: do we choose
          to turn aside from that to find another, -- a gate of ceremonies, or
          of blood, or of birth? We shall never enter that way. There is that
          knocker! By faith, great God, I will lift it now. |I, the chief of
          sinners am, have mercy upon me! |Jesus stands there. |Come in,| saith
          he, |thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without?| He
          receives me to his arms, washes, clothes, glorifies me, when I come to
          him. Am I such a fool that I do not knock? Yes, such I am by nature --
          then what a fool! O Spirit of God! make me wise to know my danger and
          my refuge! And now, sinner, in the name of him that liveth and was
          lead, and is alive for evermore, lay hold upon that knocker, lift it,
          give it a blow, and let your prayer be, ere thou leanest this
          sanctuary, |God be merciful to me a sinner!| May the Lord hear and
          bless, for his name's sake!<br />
