        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1326)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, November 26th, 1876, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
          seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise thy
          head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.| -- Genesis 3:16
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IS THE FIRST gospel sermon that was ever delivered upon the
          surface of this earth. It was memorable discourse indeed, with Jehovah
          himself for the preacher, and the whole human race and the prince of
          darkness for the audience. It must be worthy of our heartiest
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it not remarkable that this great gospel promise should have been
          delivered so soon after the transgression? As yet no sentence had been
          pronounced upon either of the two human offenders, but the promise was
          given under the form of a sentence pronounced upon the serpent Not yet
          had the woman been condemned to painful travail, or the man to
          exhausting labour, or even the soil to the curse of thorn and thistle.
          Truly |mercy rejoiceth against judgment.| Before the Lord had said
          |dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return,| he was pleased to say
          that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. Let us
          rejoice, then, in the swift mercy of God, which in the early watches
          of the night of sin came with comfortable words unto us.
        </p>
        <p>
          These words were not directly spoken to Adam and Eve, but they were
          directed distinctly to the serpent himself, and that by was of
          punishment to him for what he had done. It was a day of cruel triumph
          to him such joy as his dark mind is capable of had filled him, for had
          he indulged his malice, and gratified his spite. He had in the worst
          sense destroyed a part of God's works, he had introduce sin into the
          new world, he had stamped the human race with his own image, and
          gained new forces to promote rebellion and to multiply transgression,
          and therefore he felt that sort of gladness which a fiend can know who
          bears a hell within him. But now God comes in, takes up the quarrel
          personally, and causes him to be disgraced on the very battle-field
          upon which he had gained a temporary success. He tells the dragon that
          he will undertake to deal with him; this quarrel shall not be between
          the serpent and man, but between God and the serpent. God saith, in
          solemn words, |I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between
          thy seed and her seed,| and he promised that there shall rise in
          fulness of time a champion, who, though he suffer, shall smite in a
          vital part the power of evil, and bruise the serpent's head. This was
          the more, it seems to me, a comfortable message of mercy to Adam and
          Eve, because they would feel sure that the tempter would be punished,
          and as that punishment would involve blessing for them, the vengeance
          due to the serpent would be the guarantee of mercy to themselves.
          Perhaps, however, by thus obliquely giving the promise, the Lord meant
          to say, |Not for your sakes do I this, O fallen man and woman, nor for
          the sake of your descendants; but for my own name and honour's sake,
          that it be not profaned and blasphemed amongst the fallen spirits. I
          undertake to repair the mischief which has been caused by the tempter,
          that my name and my glory may not be diminished among the immortal
          spirits who look down upon the scene.| All this would be very humbling
          but yet consolatory to our parents if they thought of it, seeing that
          mercy given for God's sake is always to our troubled apprehension more
          sure than any favour which could be promised to us for our own sake.
          The divine sovereignty and glory afford us a stronger foundation of
          hope than merit, even if merit can be supposed to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we must note concerning this first gospel sermon that on it the
          earliest believers stayed themselves. This was all that Adam had by
          way of revelation, and all that Abel had received. This one lone star
          shone in Abel's sky; he looked up to it and he believed. By its light
          he spelt out |sacrifice,| and therefore he brought of the firstlings
          of his flock and laid them on the altar, and proved in his own person
          how the seed of the serpent hated the seed of the woman, for his
          brother slew him for his testimony. Although Enoch the seventh from
          Adam prophesied concerning the second advent, yet he does not appear
          to have uttered anything new concerning the first coming, so that
          still this one promise remained as man's sole word of hope. The torch
          which flamed within the gates of Eden just before man was driven forth
          lit up the world to all believers until the Lord was pleased to give
          more light, and to renew and enlarge the revelation of his covenant,
          when he spake to his servant Noah. Those hoary fathers who lived
          before the flood rejoiced in the mysterious language of our text, and
          resting on it, they died in faith. Nor, brethren, must you think it a
          slender revelation, for, if you attentively consider, it is
          wonderfully full of meaning. If it had been on my heart to handle it
          doctrinally this morning, I think I could have shown you that it
          contains all the gospel. There lie within it, as an oak lies within an
          acorn, all the great truths which make up the gospel of Christ.
          Observe that here is the grand mystery of incarnation. Christ is that
          seed of the woman who is here spoken of; and there is a hint not
          darkly given as to how that Incarnation would be effected. Jesus was
          not shadowed of the Holy Ghost, and |the holy thing| which was born of
          her was as to his humanity the seed of the woman only; as it is
          written, |Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they
          shall call his name Immanuel.| The promise plainly teaches that the
          deliverer would be born of a woman, and carefully viewed, it also
          foreshadows the divine method of the Redeemer's conception and birth.
          So also is the doctrine of the two seeds plainly taught here -- |I
          will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her
          seed.| There was evidently to be in the world a seed of the woman on
          God's side against the serpent, and a seed of the serpent that should
          always be upon the evil side even as it is unto this day. The church
          of God and the synagogue of Satan both exist. We see an Abel and a
          Cain, an Isaac and an Ishmael, a Jacob and an Esau; those that are
          born after the flesh, being the children of their father the devil,
          for his works they do, but those that are born again -- being born
          after the Spirit, after the power of the life of Christ, are thus in
          Christ Jesus the seed of the woman, and contend earnestly against the
          dragon and his seed. Here, too, the great fact of the sufferings of
          Christ is clearly foretold -- |Thou shalt bruise his heel.| Within the
          compass of those words we find the whole story of our Lord's sorrows
          from Bethlehem to Calvary. |It shall bruise thy head|: there is the
          breaking of Satan's regal power, there is the clearing away of sin,
          there is the destruction of death by resurrection, there is the
          leading of captivity captive in the ascension, there is the victory of
          truth in the world through the descent of the Spirit, and there is the
          latter-day glory in which Satan shall be bound, and there is, lastly,
          the casting of the evil one and all his followers into the lake of
          fire. The conflict and the conquest are both in the compass of these
          few fruitful words. They may not have been fully understood by those
          who first heard them, but to us they are now full of light. The text
          at first looks like a flint, hard and cold; but sparks fly from it
          plentifully, for hidden fires of infinite love and grace lie concealed
          within. Over this promise of a gracious God we ought to rejoice
          exceedingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not know what our first parents understood by it, but we may be
          certain that they gathered a great amount of comfort from it They must
          have understood that they were not then and there to be destroyed,
          because the Lord had spoken of a |seed.| They would argue that it must
          be needful that Eve should live if there should be a seed from her.
          They understood, too, that if that seed was to overcome the serpent
          and bruise his head, it must auger good to themselves: they could not
          fail to see that there was some great, some mysterious benefit to be
          conferred upon them by the victory which their seed would achieve over
          the instigator of their ruin. They went on in faith upon this, and
          were comforted in travail and in toil, and I doubt not both Adam and
          his wife in the faith thereof entered into everlasting rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I intend to handle this text in three ways. First, we
          shall notice its facts; secondly, we shall consider the experience
          within the heart of each believer which tallies to those facts; and
          then, thirdly, the encouragement which the text and its connection as
          a whole afford to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THE FACTS. The facts are four, and I call your earnest attention to
          them. The first is Enmity was excited. The text begins, |I will put
          enmity between thee and the woman.| They had been very friendly; the
          woman and the serpent had conversed together. She thought at the time
          that the serpent was her friend; and she was so much his friend that
          she took his advice in the teeth of God's precept, and was willing to
          believe bad things of the great Creator, because this wicked, crafty
          serpent insinuated the same. Now, at the moment when God spake, that
          friendship between the woman and the serpent had already in a measure
          come to an end, for she had accused the serpent to God, and said, |The
          serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.| So far, so good. The friendship
          of sinners does not last long; they have already begun to quarrel, and
          now the Lord comes in and graciously takes advantage of the quarrel
          which had commenced, and says, |I will carry this disagreement a great
          deal further, I will put enmity between thee and the woman.| Satan
          counted on man's descendants being his confederates, but God would
          break up this covenant with hell, and raise up a seed which should war
          against the Satanic power. This we have here God's first declaration
          that he will set up a rival kingdom to oppose the tyranny of sin and
          Satan, that he will create in the hearts of a chosen seed an enmity
          against evil, so that they shall fight against it, and with many a
          struggle and pain shall overcome the prince of darkness. The divine
          Spirit has abundantly achieved this plan and purpose of the Lord,
          combating the fallen angel by a glorious man: making man to be Satan's
          foe and conqueror. Henceforth the woman was to hate the evil one, and
          I do not doubt that she did so. She had abundant cause for so doing,
          and as often as she thought of him it would be with infinite regret
          that she could have listened to his malicious and deceitful talk. The
          woman's seed has also evermore had enmity against the evil one. I mean
          not the carnal seed, for Paul tells us, |They which are the children
          of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of
          the promise are counted for the seed.| The carnal seed of the man and
          the woman are not meant, but the spiritual seed, even Christ Jesus and
          those who are in him. Wherever you meet these, they hate the serpent
          with a perfect hatred. We would if we could destroy from our souls
          every work of Satan, and out of this poor afflicted world of ours we
          would root up every evil which he has planted. That seed of the woman,
          that glorious One, -- for he speaks not of seeds as of many but of
          seed that is one, -- you know how he abhorred the devil and all his
          devices. There was enmity between Christ and Satan, for he came to
          destroy the works of the devil and to deliver those who are under
          bondage to him. For that purpose was he born; for that purpose did he
          live; for that purpose did he die; for that purpose he has gone into
          the glory, and for that purpose he will come again, that everywhere he
          may find out his adversary and utterly destroy him and his works form
          amongst the sons of men. This putting of the enmity between the two
          seeds was the commencement of the plan of mercy, the first act in the
          programme of grace. Of the woman's seed it was henceforth said, |Thou
          lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God,
          hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes the second prophecy, which has also turned into a fact,
          namely the coming of the champion. The seed of the woman by promise is
          to champion the cause, and oppose the dragon. That seed is the Lord
          Jesus Christ. The prophet Micah saith, |But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah;
          though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
          shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose
          goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. Therefore will
          he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought
          forth.| To none other than the babe which was born in Bethlehem of the
          blessed Virgin can the words of the prophecy refer. She it was who did
          conceive and bear a son, and it is concerning her son that we sing,
          |Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and his name shall
          be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting
          Father, the Prince of Peace.| On the memorable night at Bethlehem,
          when angels sang in heaven, the seed of the woman appeared, and as
          soon as ever he saw the light the old serpent, the devil, entered into
          the heart of Herod if possible to slay him, but the Father preserved
          him, and suffered none to lay hands on him. As soon as he publicly
          came forward upon the stage of action, thirty years after, Satan met
          him foot to foot. You know the story of the temptation in the
          wilderness, and how there the woman's seed fought with him who was a
          liar from the beginning. The devil assailed him thrice with all the
          artillery of flattery, malice, craft and falsehood, but the peerless
          champion stood unwounded, and chased his foeman from the field. Then
          our Lord set up his kingdom, and called one and another unto him, and
          carried the war into the enemy's country. In divers places he cast out
          devils. He spake to the wicked and unclean spirit and said, |I charge
          thee come out of him,| and the demon was expelled. Legions of devils
          flew before him: they sought to hide themselves in swine to escape
          from the terror of his presence. |Art thou come to torment us before
          our time?| was their cry when the wonder-working Christ dislodged them
          from the bodies which they tormented. Yea, and he made his own
          disciples mighty against the evil one, for in his name they cast out
          devils, till Jesus said, |I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
          heaven.| Then there came a second personal conflict, for I take it
          that Gethsemane's sorrows were to a great degree caused by a personal
          assault of Satan, for our Master said, |This is your hour, and the
          power of darkness.| He said also, |The Prince of this world cometh.|
          What a struggle it was. Though Satan had nothing in Christ, yet did he
          seek if possible to lead him away from completing his great sacrifice,
          and there did our Master sweat as it were great drops of blood,
          falling to the ground, in the agony which it cost him to contend with
          the fiend. Then it was that our Champion began the last fight of all
          and won it to the bruising of the serpent's head. Nor did he end till
          he had spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of them
          openly.
        </p>
        <p>|Now is the hour of darkness past,</p>
        <p>Christ has assumed his reigning power;</p>
        <p>Behold the great accuser cast</p>
        <p>Down from his seat to reign no more.|</p>
        <p>
          The conflict our glorious Lord continues in his seed. We preach Christ
          crucified, and every sermon shakes the gates of hell. We bring sinners
          to Jesus by the Spirit's power, and every convert is a stone torn down
          from the wall of Satan's mighty castle. Yea, and the day shall come
          when everywhere the evil one shall be overcome, and the words of John
          in the Revelation shall be fulfilled. |And the great dragon was cast
          out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth
          the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were
          cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is
          come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
          power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,
          which accused them before our God day and night.| Thus did the Lord
          God in the words of our text promise a champion who should be the seed
          of the woman, between whom and Satan there should be war for ever and
          ever: that champion has come, the man-child has been born, and thought
          the dragon is wroth with the woman, and made war with the remnant of
          her seed which keep the testimony of Jesus Christ, yet the battle is
          the Lord's, and the victory falleth unto him whose name is Faithful
          and True, who in righteousness doth judge and make war.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third fact which comes out in the text, though not quite in that
          order, is that our Champion's heel should be bruised. Do you need that
          I explain this? You know how all his life long his heel, that is, his
          lower part, his human nature, was perpetually being made to suffer. He
          carried our sicknesses and sorrows. But the bruising came mainly when
          both in body and in mind his whole human nature was made to agonize;
          when his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and his enemies
          pierced his hands and his feet, and he endured the shame and pain of
          death by crucifixion. Look at your Master and your King upon the
          cross, all disdained with blood and dust! There was his heel most
          cruelly bruised. When they take down that precious body and wrap it in
          fair white linen and in spices, and lay it in Joseph's tomb, they weep
          as they handle the casket in which the Deity had dwelt, for there
          again Satan had bruised his heel. It was not merely that God had
          bruised him, |though it pleased the Father to bruise him,| but the
          devil had let loose Herod, and Pilate, and Caiaphas, and the Jews, and
          the Romans, all of them his tools, upon him whom he knew to be the
          Christ, so that he was bruised of the old serpent. That is all,
          however! It is only his heel, not his head, which is bruised! For lo,
          the Champion rises again; the bruise was not mortal nor continual.
          Though he dies, yet still so brief is the interval in which he
          slumbers in the tomb that his holy body hath not seen corruption, and
          he comes forth perfect and lovely in his manhood, rising from his
          grave as from a refreshing sleep after so long a day of unresting
          toil! Oh the triumph of that hour! As Jacob only halted on his thigh
          when he overcame the angel, so did Jesus only retain a scar in his
          heel, and that he bears to the skies as his glory and beauty. Before
          the throne he looks like a lamb that has been slain, but in the power
          of an endless life he liveth unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes the fourth fact, namely, that while his heel was being
          bruised, he was to bruise the serpent's head. The figure represents
          the dragon as inflicting an injury upon the champion's heel, but at
          the same moment the champion himself with that heel crushes in the
          head of the serpent with fatal effect. By his sufferings Christ has
          overthrown Satan, by the heel that was bruised he has trodden upon the
          head which devised the bruising.
        </p>
        <p>|Lo, by the sons of hell he dies;</p>
        <p>But as he hangs twixt earth and skies,</p>
        <p>He gives their prince a fatal blow,</p>
        <p>And triumphs o'er the powers below</p>
        <p>
          Though Satan is not dead, my brethren, I was about to say, would God
          he were, and though he is not converted, and never will be, nor will
          the malice of his heart ever be driven from him, yet Christ has so far
          broken his head that he has missed his mark altogether. He intended to
          make the human race the captives of his power, but they are redeemed
          from his iron yoke. God has delivered many of them, and the day shall
          come when he will cleanse the whole earth from the serpent's slimy
          trail, so that the entire world shall be full of the praises of God.
          He thought that this world would be the arena of his victory over God
          and good, instead of which it is already the grandest theatre of
          divine wisdom, love, grace, and power. Even heaven itself is not so
          resplendent with mercy as the earth is, for here it is the Saviour
          poured out his blood, which cannot be said even of the courts of
          paradise above. Moreover he thought, no doubt, that when he had led
          our race astray and brought death upon them, he had effectually marred
          the Lord's work. He rejoiced that they would all pass under the cold
          seal of death, and that their bodies would rot in the sepulchre. Had
          he not spoiled the handiwork of his great Lord? God may make man as a
          curious creature with intertwisted veins and blood and nerves, and
          sinews and muscles, and he may put into his nostrils the breath of
          life; but, |Ah,| saith Satan, |I have infused a poison into him which
          will make him return to the dust from which he was taken.| but now,
          behold, our Champion whose heel was bruised has risen from the dead,
          and given us a pledge that all his followers shall rise form the dead
          also. Thus is Satan foiled, for death shall not retain a bone, nor a
          piece of a bone, of one of those who belonged to the woman's seed. At
          the trump of the archangel from the earth and from the sea they shall
          arise, and this shall be their shout, |O death, where is thy sting? O
          grave, where is thy victory?| Satan, knowing this, feels already that
          by the resurrection his head is broken. Glory be to the Christ of God
          for this!
        </p>
        <p>
          In multitudes of other ways the devil has been vanquished by our Lord
          Jesus, and so shall he ever be till he shall be cast into the lake of
          fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us now view OUR EXPERIENCE AS IT TALLIES WITH THESE FACTS.
          Now, brothers and sisters, we were by nature, as many of us as have
          been saved, the heirs of wrath even as others. It does not matter how
          godly our parents were, the first birth brought us no spiritual life,
          for the promise is not to them which are born of blood, or of the will
          of the flesh, or of the will of man, but only to those who are born of
          God, |That which is born of the flesh is flesh|; you cannot make
          anything else and there it abides, and the flesh, or carnal mind,
          abideth in death; |it is not reconciled to God, neither indeed can
          be.| He who is born into this world but once, and knows nothing of the
          new birth, must place himself among the seed of the serpent, for only
          by regeneration can we know ourselves to be the true seed. How does
          God deal with us who are his called and chosen ones? He means to save
          us, and how does he work to that end?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing he does is, he comes to us in mercy, and puts enmity
          between us and the serpent. That is the very first work of grace.
          There was peace between us and Satan once; when he tempted we yielded;
          whatever he taught us we believed; we were his willing slaves. But
          perhaps you, my brethren, can recollect when first of all you began to
          fell uneasy and dissatisfied; the world's pleasures no longer pleased
          you; all the juice seemed to have been taken out of the apple, and you
          had nothing at all. Then you suddenly perceived that you were living
          in sin, and you were miserable about it, and though you could not get
          rid of sin yet you hated it, and sighed over it, and cried, and
          groaned. In your heart of hearts you remained no longer on the side of
          evil, for you began to cry, |O wretched man that I am, who shall
          deliver me from the body of this death?| You were already from of old
          in the covenant of grace ordained to be the woman's seed, and now the
          decree began to discover itself in life bestowed upon you and working
          in you. The Lord in infinite mercy dropped the divine life into your
          soul. You did not know it, but there it was, a spark of the celestial
          fire, the living and incorruptible seed which abideth for ever. You
          began to hate sin, and you groaned under it as under a galling yoke;
          more and more it burdened you, you could not bear it. So it was with
          you: is it so now? Is there still enmity between you and the serpent?
          Indeed you are more and more the sworn enemies of evil, and you
          willingly acknowledge it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the champion: that is to say, |Christ was formed in you the
          hope of glory.| You heard of him and you understood the truth about
          him, and it seemed a wonderful thing that he should be your substitute
          and stand in your room and place and stead, and bear your sin and all
          its curse and punishment, and that he should give his righteousness,
          yea, and his very self, to you that you might be saved. Ah, then you
          saw how sin could be overthrown, did you not? As soon as your heart
          understood Christ then you saw that what the law could not do, in that
          it was weak through the flesh, Christ was able to accomplish, and that
          the power of sin and Satan under which you had been in bondage, and
          which you now loathed, could and would be broken and destroyed because
          Christ had come into he world to overcome it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, do you recollect how you were led to see the bruising of
          Christ's heel and to stand in wonder and observe what the enmity of
          the serpent had wrought in him? Did you no begin to feel the bruised
          heel yourself? Did not sin torment you? Did not the very thought of it
          vex you? Did not your own heart become a plague to you? Did not Satan
          begin to tempt you? Did he not inject blasphemous thoughts, and urge
          you on to desperate measures; did he not teach you to doubt the
          existence of God, and the mercy of God, and the possibility of your
          salvation, and so on? This was his nibbling at your heel. He is at his
          old tricks still. He worries whom he can't devour with a malicious
          joy. Did not your worldly friends begin to annoy you? Did they not
          give you the cold shoulder because they saw something about you so
          strange and foreign to their tastes? Did they not impute your conduct
          to fanaticism, pride, obstinacy, bigotry, and the like? Ah, this
          persecution is the serpent's seed beginning to discover the woman's
          seed, and to carry on the old war. What does Paul say? |But as then he
          that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the
          Spirit, even so it is now.| True godliness is an unnatural and strange
          thing to them, and they cannot away with it Though there are no stakes
          in Smithfield, nor racks in the Tower, yet the enmity of the human
          heart towards Christ and his seed is just the same, and very often
          shows itself in |trials of cruel mockings| which to the tender hearts
          are very hard to bear. Well, this is your heel being bruised in
          sympathy with the bruising of the heel of the glorious seed of the
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, do you know something of the other fact, namely, that
          we conquer, for the serpent's head is broken in us? How say you? Is
          not the power and dominion of sin broken in you? Do you not feel that
          you cannot sin because you are born of God? Some sins which were
          masters of you once, do not trouble you now. I have known a man guilty
          of profane swearing, and from the moment of his conversion he has
          never had any difficulty in the matter. We have known a man snatched
          from drunkenness, and the cure by divine grace has been very wonderful
          and complete. We have known persons delivered from unclean living, and
          they have at once become chaste and pure, because Christ has smitten
          the old dragon such blows that he could not have power over them in
          that respect. The chosen seed sin and mourn it, but they are not
          slaves to sin; their heart goeth not after it they have to say
          sometimes |the thing I do,| but they are wretched when it is so. They
          consent with their heart to the law of God that it is good, and they
          sigh and cry that they may be helped to obey it, for they are no
          longer under the slavery of sin; the serpent's reigning power and
          dominion is broken in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is broken next in this way, that the guilt of sin is gone. The
          great power of the serpent lies in unpardoned sin. He cries |l have
          make you guilty: I brought you under the curse.| No,| say we, |we are
          delivered from the curse and are now blessed, for it is written,
          Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
          covered.' We are no longer guilty, for who shall lay anything to the
          charge of God's elect? Since Christ hath justified, who is he that
          condemneth? Here is a swinging blow for the old dragon's head, such as
          he never will recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes the Lord also grants us to know what it is to overcome
          temptation, and so to break the dead of the fiend, Satan allures us
          with many baits; he has studied our points well he knows the weakness
          of the flesh: but many and many a time blessed be God, we have foiled
          him completely to his eternal shame! The devil must have felt himself
          mean that day when he tried to overthrow Job, dragged him down to a
          dunghill, robbed him of everything, covered him with sores, and yet
          could not make him yield. Job conquered when he cried, |Though he slay
          me yet will I trust in him.| A feeble man had vanquished a devil who
          could raise the wind and blow down a house, and destroy the family who
          were feasting in it. Devil as he is, and crowned prince of the power
          of the air, yet the poor bereaved patriarch sitting on the dunghill
          covered with sores, being one of the woman's seed, through the
          strength of the inner life won the victory over him.
        </p>
        <p>|Ye sons of God oppose his rage.</p>
        <p>Resist, and he'll be gone:</p>
        <p>Thus did our dearest Lord engage</p>
        <p>And vanquish him alone.|</p>
        <p>
          Moreover, dear brethren, we have this hope that the very being of sin
          in us will be destroyed. The day will come when we shall be without
          spot or wrinkle or any such thing; and we shall stand before the
          throne of God, having suffered no injury whatever from the fall and
          from all the machinations of Satan, for are |they are without fault
          before the throne of God.| What triumph that will be! |The Lord will
          tread Satan under your feet shortly.| When he has made you perfect and
          free from all sin, as he will do, you will have bruised the serpent's
          head indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And your resurrection, too, when Satan shall see you come up from the
          grave like one that has been perfumed in a bath of spices, when he
          shall see you arise in the image of Christ, with the same body which
          was sown in corruption and weakness raised in incorruption and power,
          then will he feel an infinite chagrin, and know that his head is
          bruised by the woman's seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ought to add that every time any one of us is made useful in saving
          souls we do as it were repeat the bruising of the serpent's head. When
          you go, dear sister, among those poor children, and pick them up from
          the gutters, where they are Satan's prey, where he finds the raw
          material for thieves and criminals, and when through your means, by
          the grace of God, the little wonderers become children of the living
          God, then you in your measure bruise the old serpent's head, I pray
          you do not spare him. When we by preaching the gospel turn sinners
          from the error of their ways, so that they escape from the power of
          darkness, again we bruise the serpent's head. Whenever in any shape of
          way you are blessed to the aiding of the cause of truth and
          righteousness in the world, you, too, who were once beneath his power,
          and even now have sometimes to suffer from his nibbling at your heel,
          you tread upon his head. In all deliverances and victories you
          overcome, and prove the promise true, -- |Thou shalt tread upon the
          lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under
          feet. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
          him I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let us speak awhile upon THE ENCOURAGEMENT which our text and the
          context yields to us; for it seems to me to abound.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you, brethren, to exercise faith in the promise and be
          comforted. The text evidently encouraged Adam very much. I do not
          think we have attached enough importance to the conduct of Adam after
          the Lord had spoken to him. Notice the simple but conclusive proof
          which he gave of his faith. Sometimes an action may be very small and
          unimportant, and yet, as a straw shows which way the wind blows, it
          may display at once, if it be thought over, the whole state of the
          man's mind. Adam acted in faith upon what God had said, for we read,
          |And Adam called his wife's name Eve (or Life); because she was the
          mother of all living| (verse 20). She was not a mother at all, but as
          the life was to come through her by virtue of the promised seed, Adam
          marks his full conviction of the truth of the promise though at the
          time the woman had borne no children. There stood Adam, fresh from the
          awful presence of God, what more could he say? He might have said with
          the Prophet, |My flesh trembleth fro the fear of thee,| but even then
          he turns round to his fellow-culprit as she stands there trembling
          too, and he calls her Eve, mother of the life that is yet to be. It
          was grandly spoken by Father Adam: it makes him rise in our esteem.
          Had he been left to himself he would have murmured or at least
          despaired, but no, his faith in the new promise gave him hope. He
          uttered no word of repining against the condemnation to till with toil
          the unthankful ground, nor on Eve's part was there a word of repining
          over the appointed sorrows of motherhood; they each accept the
          well-deserved sentence with the silence which denotes the perfection
          of their resignation; their only word is full of simple faith. There
          was no child on whom to set their hopes, nor would the true seed be
          born for an age, still Eve is to be the mother of all the living, and
          he calls her so. Exercise like faith, my brother, on the far wider
          revelation which God has given to you, and always extract the utmost
          comfort from it. Make a point, whenever you receive a promise from
          God, to get all you can out of it if you carry out that rule, it is
          wonderful what comfort you will gain. Some go on the principle of
          getting as little as possible out of God's word. I believe that such a
          plan is the proper way with a man's word; always understand it at the
          minimum, because that is what he means; but God's word is to be
          understood at the maximum, for he will do exceeding abundantly above
          what you ask or even think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice by way of further encouragement that we may regard our
          reception of Christ's righteousness as an installment of the final
          overthrow of the devil. The twenty-first verse says, |Unto Adam also
          and to his wife did the Lord God made coats of skins, and clothed
          them.| A very condescending, thoughtful, and instructive deed of
          divine love! God heard what Adam said to his wife, and saw that he was
          a believer, and so he comes and gives him the type of the perfect
          righteousness, which is the believer's portion -- he covered him with
          lasting raiment. No more fig leaves, which were a mere mockery, but a
          close fitting garment which had been procured through the death of a
          victim; the Lord brings that and puts it on him, and Adam could no
          more say, |I am naked.| How could he, for God had clothed him. Now,
          beloved, let us take out of the promise that is given us concerning
          our Lord's conquest over the devil this one item and rejoice in it,
          for Christ has delivered us from the power of the serpent who opened
          our eyes and told us we were naked, by covering us from head to foot
          with a righteousness which adorns and protects us, so that we are
          comfortable in heart, and beautiful in the sight of God, and are no
          more ashamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, by way of encouragement in pursuing the Christian life, I would
          say to young people, expect to be assailed. If you have fallen into
          trouble through being a Christian, be encouraged by it; do not at all
          regret of fear it, but rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy, for
          this is the constant token of the covenant. There is enmity between
          the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent still, and if you
          did not experience any of it you might begin to fear that you were on
          the wrong side. Now that you smart under the sneer of sarcasm and
          oppression rejoice and triumph, for now are ye partakers with the
          glorious seed of the woman in the bruising of his heel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still further encouragement comes from this. Your suffering as a
          Christian is not brought upon you for your own sake; ye are partners
          with the great seed of the woman, ye are confederates with Christ. You
          must not think the devil cares much about you: the battle is against
          Christ in you. When, if you were not in Christ, the devil would never
          trouble you. When you were without Christ in the world you might have
          sinned as you like, your relatives and workmates would not have been
          at all grieved with you, they would rather have joined you in it; but
          now the serpent's seed hates Christ in you. This exalts the sufferings
          of persecution to a position far above all common afflictions. I have
          heard of a woman who was condemned to death in the Marian days, and
          before her time came to be burned a child was born to her, and she
          cried out in her sorrow. A wicked adversary, who stood by said, |how
          will you bear to die for your religion if you make such ado?| |Ah,|
          she said, |Now I suffer in my own person as a woman, but then I shall
          not suffer, but Christ in me.| Nor were these idle words, for she bore
          her martyrdom with exemplary patience, and rose in her chariot of fire
          in holy triumph to heaven. If Christ be in you, nothing will dismay
          you, but you will overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil by
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last of all, let us resist the devil always with this belief that he
          has received a broken head. I am inclined to think that Luther's way
          of laughing at the devil was a very good one, for he is worthy of
          shame and everlasting contempt. Luther once threw and inkstand at his
          head when he was tempting him very sorely, and though the act itself
          appears absurd enough, yet it was a true type of what that greater
          reformer was all his life long, for the books he wrote were truly a
          flinging of the inkstand at the head of the fiend. That is what we
          have to do: we are to resist him by all means. Let us do this bravely,
          and tell him to his teeth that we are not afraid of him. Tell him to
          recollect his bruised head, which he tries to cover with a crown of
          pride, or with a popish cowl, or with an infidel doctor's hood. We
          know him, and see the deadly wound he bears. His power is gone; he is
          fighting a lost battle; he is contending against omnipotence. He has
          set himself against the oath of the Father; against the blood of the
          incarnate Son; against the eternal power and Godhead of the blessed
          Spirit, all of which are engaged in the defence of the seed of the
          woman in the day of battle. Therefore, brethren, be ye steadfast in
          resisting the evil one being strong in faith, giving glory to God.
        </p>
        <p>|Tis by thy blood, immortal Lamb,</p>
        <p>Thine armies tread the tempter down;</p>
        <p>|tis by thy word and powerful name</p>
        <p>They gain the battle and renown.</p>
        <p>|Rejoice ye heavens; let every star</p>
        <p>Shine with new glories round the sky;</p>
