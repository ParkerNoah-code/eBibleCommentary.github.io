          Of those who ought not to be admitted to clear themselves, and of the
          duty of having no fellowship with the excommunicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the dearly-beloved brethren in the ministry of the Church Catholic
          in all regions, Fabian sends greeting in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the divine precepts and the apostolic institutes, we are admonished
          to watch in behoof of the position of all the churches with unwearied
          interest. Whence it follows that you ought to know what is being done
          in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following
          her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called
          your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our
          fathers, we maintain seven deacons in the city of Rome distributed
          over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined
          on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals,
          in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the
          succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for
          religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon
          them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different
          cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged
          zealously and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore,
          we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by
          (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate
          account the histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our
          examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no doubt or
          questioning of these things may arise in later times; |for whatsoever
          things were written, were written for our learning.| And whatsoever
          things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning
          of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in
          charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them,
          from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the
          faithful. For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal
          benignity, that the holy Church may now find the good-will of your
          love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever
          there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the
          assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit
          these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church;
          so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your
          virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep
          off reproaches by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you
          also, according to the word of the apostle, to be |stedfast and
          immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye
          know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.| And in another place:
          |Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men,
          and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.| Furthermore, we
          desire you to know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed
          us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion,
          seeking whom he may devour, instigated him, Novatus came up out of
          Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of
          Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them into the
          acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep
          yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine
          different from that which the apostles and their successors have held
          and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into
          the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most
          earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it
          fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching
          and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our holy mother
          the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be
          delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from
          troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free
          course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of
          all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and
          perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious
          supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all
          men to be saved, and no one to perish, may, by His vast omnipotence,
          cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic
          faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil
          who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our
          mother the Church. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity
          upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they
          be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other
          efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye
          may approve yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy
          Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward. These
          men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the
          true faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they
          are branded with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy
          mother the Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to
          correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in
          agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal
          Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to
          the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold
          the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly
          therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of
          suspicion in the matter of the true faith, rejected. Neither are they
          at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the faith of the
          Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the
          accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy
          fathers in times past and times future alike anathematize.
          Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the
          unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the
          unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always
          troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently
          they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a
          distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason,
          dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such persons, into which we know
          many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such persons, and
          of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those
          closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of
          the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and
          comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be ye,
          according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as
          doves. See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but,
          sustained by each other's prayers and supplications, strive ye to do
          the will of God; and from those persons whom I have mentioned, if they
          show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things.
          In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the
          apostle makes mention when he says, |with such persons, no, not to
          eat;| since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected,
          and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the
          Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly
          separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until
          such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be
          admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they
          ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already
          mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or
          underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the apostles
          decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held.
          And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the
          excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with them,
          that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such
          persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are
          not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those
          who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with
          those who do them. Whence also the blessed chief of the apostles,
          Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this
          among other things: If this Clement is hostile to any one on account
          of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on
          terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as
          ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and
          separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be
          inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order
          that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the
          friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation
          all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that he may
          return to spiritual well-being (redeat et salutem) hereby, when he
          begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, however, any one is not friendly, and speaks with those with whom
          he (his chief) speaks not, such an one belongs to those who seek to
          exterminate the Church of God; and though he seems to be with you in
          body, he is against you in mind and heart. And such an one is a much
          more dangerous enemy than those who are without, and who are openly
          hostile. For this man under the guise of friendship acts the part of
          an enemy, and scatters and ruins the church. And therefore, dearly
          beloved, in these apostolic institutes we warn and teach you, that
          your charity, being instructed therein (effecta certior), may
          hereafter study to act with greater care and prudence, so that
          perverse and unbelieving men may not have the power of injuring the
          faithful and well-disposed; for the hope of such, and of all the
          ungodly, is like dust that is blown away with the wind; and like a
          thin froth that is driven away with the storm; and like as the smoke
          which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and as the
          remembrance of a guest of a single day that passeth away. With the
          utmost care, dearly beloved, are such persons to be guarded against,
          and avoided, and rejected, if they show themselves injurious. For the
          laws of the world, no less than those of the Church, do not admit the
          injurious, but reject them. Whence it is written, |The mouth of the
          wicked devoureth iniquity.| And the Lord, speaking by the prophet,
          saith, |With the holy thou wilt show thyself holy; and with the
          froward thou wilt show thyself froward; and with the excellent thou
          wilt show thyself excellent (electus); and with the innocent man thou
          wilt show thyself innocent.| And the apostle says, |Evil
          communications corrupt good manners.| Wherefore, as has already been
          indicated, the wicked are always to be avoided and shunned, and the
          good and rightly-disposed are to be stedfastly followed, in order
          that, as far as possible, we may avoid the peril of sloth. And lest
          this pest may be spread abroad more widely, let us cut it off from us
          with all possible severity; for the temerity of presumption does not
          intervene where there is the diligence of piety. Let every one of you,
          sustained by this apostolic representation, act according to his
          strength, and study in brotherly love and in godly piety to keep his
          own manners correct, and to help each other, and to abide in charity,
          and to keep himself in the will of God unceasingly, in order that we
          may praise the Lord together, and give Him thanks always without
          wearying. Fare ye well in the Lord, dearly beloved, and with the
          Lord's help strive to fulfil to the best of your ability the things
          before mentioned. -- Given on the first day of July, in the consulship
          of the most illustrious Maximinus (or, Maximus) and Africanus.
