          I found at the Armenian Convent of St. Lazarus, near Venice, a version
          of the Letter of Abgar, translated into French |from the Armenian
          version of the fifth century,| and published in 1868, which is now
          before me. It ascribes the original to Laboubnia, and adds: |The name
          Léroubna, mentioned only by Moses of Chorène, was not repeated after
          him by any one else, save, perhaps, Mekhitar d'Aïrivank (one of our
          chroniclers of the thirteenth century), who puts him among our
          historians, between Tatien and Mar Ibas Gadina, but without affirming
          whether he knew him only by name or also by his writings.| The editor
          goes on to speak of his correspondence with Dr. Cureton (a.d.1864)
          which is referred to in note 4, p.665, supra. He notes the incomplete
          and mutilated character of the Syriac copies used by Cureton, and
          congratulates himself on the entire and integral condition of the
          Armenian, which he found in 1852 in the Imperial Library at Paris, as
          Codex No.88, mss. Armen. Here the name of the author is given as
          Laboubnia, and agrees with the Syriac. The interpolations he regards
          as made after the fourth century.<br />
