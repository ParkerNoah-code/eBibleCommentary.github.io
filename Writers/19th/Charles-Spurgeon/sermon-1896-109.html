          1. Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, ye servants of Jehovah! praise the name
          of Jehovah.2. Blessed be the name of Jehovah henceforth and for
          ever.3. Jehovah's name is to be praised, from the rising of the sun
          unto his going down.4. Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory is
          above the heavens.

          1 Praise, ye servants of Jehovah! This psalm contains abundant reasons
          for all men without exception to praise God. The faithful alone being
          endued with spiritual perception to recognize the hand of God, the
          prophet addresses them in particular. And if we consider how cold and
          callous men are in this religious exercise, we will not deem the
          repetition of the call to praise God superfluous. We all acknowledge
          that we are created to praise God's name, while, at the same time, his
          glory is disregarded by us. Such criminal apathy is justly condemned
          by the prophet, with the view of stirring us up to unwearied zeal in
          praising God. The repetition, then, of the exhortation to praise him,
          ought to be considered as referring both to perseverance and ardor in
          this service. If, by the servants of God, some would rather understand
          the Levites, to whom the charge of celebrating his praises under the
          Law was committed, I am not much opposed to it, provided they do not
          exclude the rest of the faithful, over whom formerly God appointed the
          Levites as leaders and chief musicians, that he might be praised by
          all his people without exception. When the Holy Spirit addresses the
          Levites expressly in relation to the subject of God's praises, it is
          designedly that, by their example, they may show the way to others,
          and that the whole Church may respond in one holy chorus. Now that we
          are all |a royal priesthood,| (1 Peter 2:9) and as Zechariah
          testifies, (Zechariah 14:21) that under the reign of Christ, the
          meanest of the people shall be Levites, there is no question that,
          excepting unbelievers who are mute, the prophet invites us all in
          common to render this service unto God.
        </p>

          2 Blessed be the name of Jehovah The prophet confirms what I stated
          above, that the praises of God must be continued throughout the whole
          course of our life. If his name is to be continually praised, it
          ought, at least, to be our earnest endeavor, during our brief
          pilgrimage here, that the remembrance of it may flourish after we are
          dead. In the next verse, he extends the glory of God's name to all
          parts of the earth; wherefore our apathy will be totally inexcusable,
          if we do not make its praises resound among ourselves. Under the law,
          God could not be praised aright, excepting in Judea by his own people,
          to whom the knowledge of him was confined. His works, however, which
          are visible to all nations, are worthy of the admiration of the whole
          world. To the same effect is the following clause respecting the
          loftiness of God's glory; for can there be any thing more base, than
          for us to magnify it but seldom and tardily, considering it ought to
          fill our thoughts with enrapturing admiration? In extolling the name
          of God so highly, the prophet intends to show us that there is no
          ground for indifference; that silence would savor of impiety were we
          not to exert ourselves to the utmost of our ability to celebrate his
          praises, in order that our affections may, as it were, rise above the
          heavens. When he adds, that God is high above all nations, there is an
          implied reproach, by which he fastens upon the chosen people the
          charge of apathy in the exercise of praise. For can there be any thing
          more preposterous, than for those who are eye-witnesses of God's
          glory, which shines forth even among the blind, to refrain from making
          it the theme of their praises? At the very time when God conferred
          upon the Jews the exclusive honor of being the depositaries of the
          knowledge of his heavenly doctrine, he was nevertheless, according to
          Paul, not without a witness, (Acts 14:17; Romans 1:20) After the
          promulgation of the Gospel, his exaltation above the nations was more
          evident, for then the whole world was placed under his sway.<br />
