          1. While the Demiurge was thus ignorant of all things, they tell us
          that the Saviour conferred honour upon the Pleroma by the creation
          [which he summoned into existence] through means of his Mother,
          inasmuch as he produced similitudes and images of those things which
          are above. But I have already shown that it was impossible that
          anything should exist beyond the Pleroma (in which external region
          they tell us that images were made of those things which are within
          the Pleroma), or that this world was formed by any other one than the
          Supreme God. But it is a pleasant thing to overthrow them on every
          side, and to prove them vendors of falsehood; let us say, in
          opposition to them, that if these things were made by the Saviour to
          the honour of those which are above, after their likeness, then it
          behoved them always to endure, that those things which have been
          honoured should perpetually continue in honour. But if they do in fact
          pass away, what is the use of this very brief period of honour, -- an
          honour which at one time had no existence, and which shall again come
          to nothing? In that case I shall prove that the Saviour is rather an
          aspirant after vainglory, than one who honours those things which are
          above. For what honour can those things which are temporal confer on
          such as are eternal and endure for ever? or those which pass away on
          such as remain? or those which are corruptible on such as are
          incorruptible? -- since, even among men who are themselves mortal,
          there is no value attached to that honour which speedily passes away,
          but to that which endures as long as it possibly can. But those things
          which, as soon as they are made, come to an end, may justly be said
          rather to have been formed for the contempt of such as are thought to
          be honoured by them; and that that which is eternal is contumeliously
          treated when its image is corrupted and dissolved. But what if their
          Mother had not wept, and laughed, and been involved in despair? The
          Saviour would not then have possessed any means of honouring the
          Fulness, inasmuch as her last state of confusion did not have
          substance of its own by which it might honour the Propator.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Alas for the honour of vainglory which at once passes away, and no
          longer appears! There will be some Æon, in whose case such honour will
          not be thought at all to have had an existence, and then the things
          which are above will be unhonoured; or it will be necessary to produce
          once more another Mother weeping, and in despair, in order to the
          honour of the Pleroma. What a dissimilar, and at the same time
          blasphemous image! Do you tell me that an image of the Only-begotten
          was produced by the former of the world, whom again ye wish to be
          considered the Nous (mind) of the Father of all, and [yet maintain]
          that this image was ignorant of itself, ignorant of creation, --
          ignorant, too, of the Mother, -- ignorant of everything that exists,
          and of those things which were made by it; and are you not ashamed
          while, in opposition to yourselves, you ascribe ignorance even to the
          Only-begotten Himself? For if these things [below] were made by the
          Saviour after the similitude of those which are above, while He (the
          Demiurge) who was made after such similitude was in so great
          ignorance, it necessarily follows that around Him, and in accordance
          with Him, after whose likeness he that is thus ignorant was formed,
          ignorance of the kind in question spiritually exists. For it is not
          possible, since both were produced spiritually, and neither fashioned
          nor composed, that in some the likeness was preserved, while in others
          the likeness of the image was spoiled, that image which was here
          produced that it might be according to the image of that production
          which is above. But if it is not similar, the charge will then attach
          to the Saviour, who produced a dissimilar image, -- of being, so to
          speak, an incompetent workman. For it is out of their power to affirm
          that the Saviour had not the faculty of production, since they style
          Him All Things. If, then, the image is dissimilar, he is a poor
          workman, and the blame lies, according to their hypothesis, with the
          Saviour. If, on the other hand, it is similar, then the same ignorance
          will be found to exist in the Nous (mind) of their Propator, that is,
          in the Only-begotten. The Nous of the Father, in that case, was
          ignorant of Himself; ignorant, too, of the Father; ignorant, moreover,
          of those very things which were formed by Him. But if He has
          knowledge, it necessarily follows also that he who was formed after
          his likeness by the Saviour should know the things which are like; and
          thus, according to their own principles, their monstrous blasphemy is
          overthrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Apart from this, however, how can those things which belong to
          creation, various, manifold, and innumerable as they are, be the
          images of those thirty Æons which are within the Pleroma, whose names,
          as these men fix them, I have set forth in the book which precedes
          this? And not only will they be unable to adapt the [vast] variety of
          creation at large to the [comparative] smallness of their Pleroma, but
          they cannot do this even with respect to any one part of it, whether
          [that possessed by] celestial or terrestrial beings, or those that
          live in the waters. For they themselves testify that their Pleroma
          consists of thirty Æons; but any one will undertake to show that, in a
          single department of those [created beings] which have been mentioned,
          they reckon that there are not thirty, but many thousands of species.
          How then can those things, which constitute such a multiform creation,
          which are opposed in nature to each other, and disagree among
          themselves, and destroy the one the other, be the images and
          likenesses of the thirty Æons of the Pleroma, if indeed, as they
          declare, these being possessed of one nature, are of equal and similar
          properties, and exhibit no differences [among themselves]? For it was
          incumbent, if these things are images of those Æons, -- inasmuch as
          they declare that some men are wicked by nature, and some, on the
          other hand, naturally good, -- to point out such differences also
          among their Æons, and to maintain that some of them were produced
          naturally good, while some were naturally evil, so that the
          supposition of the likeness of those things might harmonize with the
          Æons. Moreover, since there are in the world some creatures that are
          gentle, and others that are fierce, some that are innocuous, while
          others are hurtful and destroy the rest; some have their abode on the
          earth, others in the water, others in the air, and others in the
          heaven; in like manner, they are bound to show that the Æons possess
          such properties, if indeed the one are the images of the others. And
          besides; |the eternal fire which the Father has prepared for the devil
          and his angels,| -- they ought to show of which of those Æons that are
          above it is the image; for it, too, is reckoned part of the creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, however, they say that these things are the images of the
          Enthymesis of that Æon who fell into passion, then, first of all, they
          will act impiously against their Mother, by declaring her to be the
          first cause of evil and corruptible images. And then, again, how can
          those things which are manifold, and dissimilar, and contrary in their
          nature, be the images of one and the same Being? And if they say that
          the angels of the Pleroma are numerous, and that those things which
          are many are the images of these -- not in this way either will the
          account they give be satisfactory. For, in the first place, they are
          then bound to point out differences among the angels of the Pleroma,
          which are mutually opposed to each other, even as the images existing
          below are of a contrary nature among themselves. And then, again,
          since there are many, yea, innumerable angels who surround the
          Creator, as all the prophets acknowledge, -- [saying, for instance,]
          |Ten thousand times ten thousand stood beside Him, and many thousands
          of thousands ministered unto Him,| -- then, according to them, the
          angels of the Pleroma will have as images the angels of the Creator,
          and the entire creation remains in the image of the Pleroma, but so
          that the thirty Æons no longer correspond to the manifold variety of
          the creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Still further, if these things [below] were made after the
          similitude of those [above], after the likeness of which again will
          those then be made? For if the Creator of the world did not form these
          things directly from His own conception, but, like an architect of no
          ability, or a boy receiving his first lesson, copied them from
          archetypes furnished by others, then whence did their Bythus obtain
          the forms of that creation which He at first produced? It clearly
          follows that He must have received the model from some other one who
          is above Him, and that one, in turn, from another. And none the less
          [for these suppositions], the talk about images, as about gods, will
          extend to infinity, if we do not at once fix our mind on one
          Artificer, and on one God, who of Himself formed those things which
          have been created. Or is it really the case that, in regard to mere
          men, one will allow that they have of themselves invented what is
          useful for the purposes of life, but will not grant to that God who
          formed the world, that of Himself He created the forms of those things
          which have been made, and imparted to it its orderly arrangement?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But, again, how can these things [below] be images of those
          [above], since they are really contrary to them, and can in no respect
          have sympathy with them? For those things which are contrary to each
          other may indeed be destructive of those to which they are contrary,
          but can by no means be their images -- as, for instance, water and
          fire; or, again, light and darkness, and other such things, can never
          be the images of one another. In like manner, neither can those things
          which are corruptible and earthly, and of a compound nature, and
          transitory, be the images of those which, according to these men, are
          spiritual; unless these very things themselves be allowed to be
          compound, limited in space, and of a definite shape, and thus no
          longer spiritual, and diffused, and spreading into vast extent, and
          incomprehensible. For they must of necessity be possessed of a
          definite figure, and confined within certain limits, that they may be
          true images; and then it is decided that they are not spiritual. If,
          however, these men maintain that they are spiritual, and diffused, and
          incomprehensible, how can those things which are possessed of figure,
          and confined within certain limits, be the images of such as are
          destitute of figure and incomprehensible?
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If, again, they affirm that neither according to configuration nor
          formation, but according to number and the order of production, those
          things [above] are the images [of these below], then, in the first
          place, these things [below] ought not to be spoken of as images and
          likenesses of those Æons that are above. For how can the things which
          have neither the fashion nor shape of those [above] be their images?
          And, in the next place, they would adapt both the numbers and
          productions of the Æons above, so as to render them identical with and
          similar to those that belong to the creation [below]. But now, since
          they refer to only thirty Æons, and declare that the vast multitude of
          things which are embraced within the creation [below] are images of
          those that are but thirty, we may justly condemn them as utterly
          destitute of sense.<br />
