          |Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.| -- 2
          Corinthians 5:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS TEXT IS exceedingly full of matter, and might require many
          treatises, and even multitudes of folios, to bring forth all its
          meaning. Holy Scripture is notably sententious. Human teachers are
          given to verbiage; we multiply words to express our meaning, but the
          Lord is wondrously laconic; he writeth as it were in shorthand, and
          gives us much in little. One single grain of the precious gold of
          Scripture may be beaten out into acres of human gold leaf, and spread
          far and wide. A few books are precious as silver, fewer still are
          golden; but God's Book hath a bank note in every syllable, and the
          worth of its sentences it were not possible for mortal intellect to
          calculate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have two great truths here, which would serve us for the subject of
          meditation for many a day: the believer's position -- he is |in
          Christ;| and the believer's character -- he is a |new creature.| Upon
          both of these we shall speak but briefly this morning, but may God
          grant that we may find instruction therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let us consider THE CHRISTIAN'S POSITION -- he is said
          to be |in Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three stages of the human soul in connection with Christ:
          the first is without Christ, this is the state of nature; the next is
          in Christ, this is the state of grace; the third is with Christ, that
          is the state of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without Christ, this is where we all are born and nurtured, and even
          though we hear the gospel, and the Bible be in all our houses, and
          even though we use a form of prayer, yet until we are born again, we
          are without God, without Christ, and strangers from the commonwealth
          of Israel. A man may stand at the banqueting-table, and may be without
          food, unless he puts out his hand to grasp that which is provided; and
          a man may have Christ preached in his hearing every Sabbath-day, and
          be without Christ, unless he putteth forth the hand of faith to lay
          hold upon him. It is a most unhappy condition to be without Christ. It
          is inconvenient to be without gold, it is miserable to be without
          health, it is deplorable to be without a friend, it is wretched to be
          without reputation, but to be without Christ is the worst lack in all
          the world. O that God would make all of us sensible of it who are now
          the subjects of it, and may we no longer tarry in the position of
          being without Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next state is that indicated in the text, |in Christ,| of which I
          will say more by-and-by. |In Christ| leadeth to the third state, which
          we can never reach without this second one, namely, to be with Christ;
          to be his companions in the rest which he has attained, all his work
          and labour done; to be with him in the glory which he has gained, made
          to see it and to participate in it world without end. To be with
          Christ is the angels' joy, it is the heaven of heaven, it is the
          centre of bliss, the sun of paradise. Let us seek after it, and in
          order that we may have it, let us labour with all our heart and mind
          to be found in Christ now, that we may be in Christ in the day of his
          appearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn we now to the expression itself, |in Christ.| I never heard of
          any persons being in any other man but Christ; we may follow certain
          leaders, political or religious, but we are never said to be included
          in them. We may take for ourselves eminent examples and high models of
          humanity, but no man is said in that respect to be in another. But
          this is a grand old scriptural phrase in which the disciple and the
          follower of Christ becomes something more than an imitator of his
          Lord, and is said to be in his Master. We must interpret this
          scriptural phrase by scriptural symbols. We were all of us in the
          first Adam. Adam stood for us. Had Adam kept the command, we had all
          of us been blessed. He took off the forbidden fruit and fell, and all
          of us fell in him. Original sin falleth upon us because of the
          transgression of our covenant head and representative, Adam the first;
          but all believers are in the same sense in Christ, Adam the second,
          the only other representative Man before God, the heavenly Man, the
          Lord from heaven. Now, as in Adam we all fell, so all who are in
          Christ are in Christ perfectly restored. The obedience of Christ is
          the obedience of all his people; the atonement of Christ is a
          propitiation for all his people's sins. In Christ we lived on earth,
          in Christ we died, in Christ we rose, and he |hath raised us up
          together, and made us sit together in heavenly places| in himself. As
          the apostle tells us that Levi was in the loins of Abraham when
          Melchisedec met him, so were we in the loins of Christ from before the
          foundation of the world; faith apprehends that blessed truth, and thus
          by faith we are experimentally in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noah's Ark was a type of Christ. The animals that were preserved from
          the deluge passed through the door into the ark, the Lord shut them
          in, and high above the foaming billows they floated in perfect safety.
          We are in Christ in the same sense. He is the ark of God provided
          against the day of judgment. We by faith believe him to be capable of
          saving us; we come and trust him, we risk our souls with him,
          believing that there is no risk; we venture on him confident that it
          is no venture; giving up every other hope or shadow of a hope, we
          trust in what Jesus did, is doing, and is in himself, and thus he
          becomes to us our ark, and we are in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another similitude may be taken from the old Jewish law. By God's
          commands certain cities were provided throughout all Canaan, that an
          Israelite who should slay his fellow at unawares, might flee there
          from the avenger of blood. The city of refuge no sooner received the
          manslayer than he was perfectly free from the avenger who pursued him.
          Once within the suburbs or through the gate, and the manslayer might
          breathe safely, the executioner would be kept at bay. In the same
          sense we are in Christ Jesus. He is God's eternal city of refuge, and
          we having offended, having slain, as it were, the command of God, flee
          for our lives and enter within the refuge city, where vengeance cannot
          reach us, but where we shall be safe world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the New Testament the Lord Jesus explains this phrase of being in
          himself in another way. He represents us as being in him as the branch
          is in the vine. Now, the branch derives all its nourishment, its sap,
          its vitality, its fruit-bearing power, from the stem with which it is
          united. It would be of no use that the branch should be placed close
          to the trunk, it would be of no service even to strap it side by side
          with the stem, it must be actually in it by a vital union. There must
          be sap-streams flowing at the proper season into it, life-floods
          gushing into it from the parent stem; and even so there is a
          mysterious union between Christ and his people, not to be explained
          but to be enjoyed, not to be defined but to be experienced, in which
          the very life of Christ flows into us, and we by the virtue that
          cometh out of him into us, become like unto him, and bring forth
          clusters of good fruit unto his honour and unto God's glory. I trust
          you know what this means, beloved, many of you. May you live in the
          possession of it daily! May you be one with Jesus, knit to him, united
          to him never to be separated for ever. As the limb is in the body,
          even so may you constantly be one with Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may be in Christ also as the stone is in the building. The stone is
          built into the wall and is a part of it. In some of the old Roman
          walls you can scarcely tell which is the firmer, the cement or the
          stone, for their cement was so exceedingly strong, that it held the
          stones together as though they were one mass of rock; and such is the
          eternal love which binds the saints to Christ. They become one rock,
          one palace wall, one temple, to the praise and glory of the God who
          built the fabric. Thus you see what it is to be in Christ: it is to
          trust him for salvation as Noah trusted the ark; it is to derive real
          life from him as the branch does from the stem; it is to lean on him,
          and to be united to him as the stone leans on the foundation and
          becomes an integral part of the structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase |in Christ Jesus,| then, has a weight of meaning in it.
          |How do we come to be there?| saith one. To whom we answer: our union
          to Christ is practically and experimentally wrought in us by faith
          when a man giveth himself up to Christ to sink or swim with Christ,
          when he leaneth his soul wholly on the Beloved, when as for his good
          works he abhorreth them, and as for his self-righteousness, he
          counteth it dross and dung, when he clingeth to the sole hope of the
          cross, then is such a man in Christ. He is further in Christ when he
          loves Jesus, when the heart having trusted and reposed in the cross,
          is moved with deep and warm affection to the Crucified, so that the
          soul clings to Christ, embracing him with fervent love, and Christ
          becomes the bridegroom, and the heart becomes his spouse, and they are
          married to one another in a union which no divorce can ever separate.
          When love and faith come together, then is there a blessedly sweet
          communion; these two graces become the double channel through which
          the Holy Spirit's influence flows forth daily, making the Christian to
          grow up more fully unto Christ Jesus in all things. The riper the
          Christian becomes, the nearer to the glory, the closer to the
          perfection which is promised, the more completely will he think and
          act, and live and move, in Christ his Master, being one with Jesus in
          all things. I shall not detain you longer over that one matter, every
          true Christian is in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we survey THE BELIEVER'S CHARACTER, for it is said that if any
          man be in Christ he is a |new creature.| This is a great utterance. We
          shall not attempt to dive into it -- this were work for a leviathan
          divine -- but merely like the swallow, we touch the surface of it with
          our wing, and away.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is meant by the Christian being a new creature? Three thoughts
          seem to me to spring up from the words, and the first is, the believer
          must then have been the subject of a radical change. He is said to be
          a new creature, which is of all things a most sweeping change. There
          are many changes which a man may undergo, but they may be far from
          being radical enough to be worth calling a new creation. Saul is among
          the prophets: hear how he prophesies; if they speak with sacred
          rapture the secrets of God, so doth he. Is not Saul converted -- the
          Scripture tells us that God gave him another heart! Ay, another heart,
          but not a new heart. A man may be changed from one sin to another,
          from reckless profanity to mocking formality, from daring sin to
          hypocritical pretension to virtue; but such a change as is very far
          from being saving, and not at all like the work which is called a new
          creation. Ahab went and humbled himself after his murder of Naboth,
          and God turned away His vengeance for awhile from him, but that
          temporary humiliation of Ahab was no sign of a renewal of his nature;
          it was like the changes of the sea, which today is smooth, but which
          anon will be as ravenous after wrecks as ever, being still unchanged
          in its nature, still voracious and cruel, fickle and unstable. Ahab
          may humble himself, but he is Ahab still, and as Ahab will he go down
          into the pit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversion is sometimes described in Scripture as healing; yet the
          idea of healing does not rise to the radical character of the text.
          Naaman went down to the Jordan full of leprosy, and he washed himself,
          and came up, after the seventh immersion, with his flesh clean like
          unto a little child; but it was the same flesh and the same Naaman,
          and he was by no means a new creature. The woman, bowed down with
          infirmity those sad eighteen years, was marvellously changed when she
          stood upright, as a daughter of Abraham, loosed at last from her
          bondage; but she was the same woman, and the description does not
          answer to a new creature. No doubt there are great moral changes
          wrought in many which are not saving. I have seen a drunkard become
          sober; I have known persons of debauched habits become regular; and
          yet their changes have not amounted to regeneration or the new birth.
          The same sin has been within them, reigning still, though it has
          assumed a different garb, and used another voice. Ah, ye may be washed
          from outward leprosies, and ye may be made straight from your visible
          infirmities, but this will not suffice you; if you are in Christ you
          must have more than this; for |if any man be in Christ, he is a new
          creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
          new.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor will the most startling changes suffice unless they are total and
          deep. The Ethiopian might change his skin, the leopard might suddenly
          lose his spots -- these would be strange prodigies; but the leopard
          would remain a leopard, and the Ethiop would still be black at heart;
          the improvement would not amount to new creation. So may a man give up
          every outward lust and every crying sin which he was wont to indulge,
          and yet, unless the change shall go far deeper than the outward life,
          he is not saved -- he is not a new creature, and, therefore, he is not
          in Christ Jesus. I venture to say, that even the metaphor of
          resurrection, which is often applied to conversion, does not go so far
          as the language of the text. The young daughter of Jairus is placed
          upon her bed, and she dies, and our Lord comes and saith to her,
          |Talitha cumi,| and she opens her eyes, she awakes, she lives, she
          eats,| still she is not a new creature; her mother receives her as the
          selfsame child. Even Lazarus, who has been dead and is supposed
          through four days of burial to have begun to stink, when he is called
          from the grave by the voice of Jesus, is the subject of a remarkable
          miracle, but it scarcely amounts to a new creation. He is the same
          Lazarus restored, not a new creature, but the same creature vivified
          from a transient sleep of death. Do you see, then, how very searching
          the word is here, a |a new creature,| absolutely a new creation. It is
          a root and branch change; not an alteration of the walls only, but of
          the foundation; not a new figuring of the visible tapestry, but a
          renewal of the fabric itself. Regeneration is a change of the entire
          nature from top to bottom in all senses and respects. Such is the new
          birth, such is it to be in Christ and to be renewed by the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text saith that we are new creatures through being in Christ. How
          comes that about? We have known persons inveigh very earnestly against
          the doctrine that men are saved by a simple faith in Jesus Christ.
          That is the gospel, and nothing else is the gospel, and those who do
          not preach that truth know nothing of God's gospel at all; for it is
          the very soul and essence of the gospel -- the article, as Luther used
          to say, by which a church stands or falls. We are saved by a simple
          faith in Jesus, but these people argue against this on the ground that
          there must be a great moral change in man before he can be reconciled
          to God and made meet to be with God for ever. But, my brethren, if the
          text be true, that those who are in Christ are new creatures, what
          greater change than this can be desired? I know no language, I believe
          there is none, that can express a greater or more thorough and more
          radical renewal, than that which is expressed in the term, |a new
          creature.| It is as though the former creature were annihilated and
          put away, and a something altogether new were formed from the breath
          of the eternal God, even as in the day when the world sprang out of
          nothing, and the morning stars sang together over a new-made universe.
          Such is the fruit of being in Christ, to be a new creature. And what,
          ye moralists, want ye more than this? What, ye pretenders to
          perfection, what, ye mystic spiritualists, who strive after a strange
          holiness to which ye never attain, what, ye that bind heavy burdens
          upon men's shoulders which ye do not touch with your fingers
          yourselves, what want ye more than this, for a man to be absolutely
          made a new creature by being in Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          How is this done? We reply that the man who is in the first Adam,
          being translated into the second Adam, becomes legally a new creature.
          As in the first Adam he is judged and condemned, his punishment is
          laid upon his substitute; but as viewed in the second representative
          Man, he is legally, and before the bar of God's justice, a new
          creature. But this is not all: he who believes in Christ, finding
          himself completely pardoned as the result of his faith in the precious
          blood of Jesus, loves Christ, and loves the God who gave Christ to be
          his redemption, and that love becomes a master passion. We have all
          heard of the expulsive power of a new affection; this new affection of
          love to God coming into the soul, expels love to sin. It enters into
          the heart of man with such a royal majesty about it that it puts down
          all his predispositions towards evil, and his prejudices against the
          Most High, and with a real and divine power it reigns within the soul.
          I suppose the mode of this great change is somewhat after this sort:
          The man at first is ignorant of his God; he does not know God to be so
          loving, so kind, so good as he is; therefore the Holy Spirit shows the
          man Christ, lets him see the love of God in the person of Christ, and
          thus illuminates the understanding. Whereas the sinner thought nothing
          of' God before, or his few stray thoughts were all dark and terrible,
          now he learns the infinite love of God in the person of Christ, and
          his understanding gets clearer views of God than it ever had before.
          Then, in turn, the understanding acts upon the affections. Learning
          God to be thus good and kind, the heart, which was hard towards God,
          is softened, and the man loves the gracious Father who gave Jesus to
          redeem him from his sins. The affections being changed, the whole man
          is on the way towards a great and radical renewal, for now the
          emotions find another ruler. The passions, once rabid as vultures at
          the sight of the carrion of sin, now turn with loathing from iniquity,
          and are only stirred by holy principle. The convert groweth vehement
          against evil, as vehement as he once was against the right. Now he
          longeth and pineth after communion with God as once he longed and
          pined after sin. The affections, like a rudder, have changed the
          direction of the emotions, and meanwhile the will, that stubbornest
          thing of all, that iron sinew, is led in a blessed captivity, wearing
          silken fetters. The heart wills to do what God wills, yea, it wills to
          be perfect, for to will is present with us, though how to perform all
          that we would we find not. See then, beloved friends, how great is the
          change wrought in us by our being in Christ! It is a thorough and
          entire change, affecting all the parts, powers, and passions of our
          manhood. Grace doth not reform us, but re-creates us; it doth not pare
          away here and there an evil excrescence, but it implants a holy and
          divine principle which goes to instant war with all indwelling sin,
          and continues to fight until corruption is subdued, and holiness is
          enthroned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall only pause to ask this one question -- do my hearers all know
          what such a change as this means? Believe me, you must know it
          personally for yourselves, or you can never enter heaven. Let no man
          deceive you. That regeneration which is said to be wrought in baptism,
          is a figment without the shadow of foundation. The sprinkling of an
          infant makes no change in that child whatever; it is, as I believe, a
          vain ceremony, not commanded of God, nor warranted in Scripture; and
          as the Church of England practises it, it is altogether pernicious and
          superstitious, and if there be any effect following it, it must be an
          evil effect upon those who wickedly lie unto Almighty God, by
          promising and vowing that the unconscious shall keep God's
          commandments, and walk in the same all the days of his life; which
          they cannot do for the child, inasmuch as they cannot even so do for
          themselves. Ye must have another regeneration than this, the work not
          of priestly fingers, with their hocus-pocus and superstitious
          genuflexions, but the work of the Eternal Spirit, who alone can
          regenerate the soul, whose office alone it is that can give light to
          the spiritually blinded eye, and sensation to the spiritually dead
          heart. Be not misled by the priests of this age. Ye profess to have
          cast off Rome, cast off her Anglican children. Wear not the rags of
          her superstition, nor bear her mark in your foreheads. Ye must be born
          again in another sense than formality can work in you. It must be an
          inward work, a spiritual work, and only this can save your souls. If
          any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature, that is, he has
          experienced a radical change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, another thought starts up from the expression in the text.
          There is divine working here. |A new creature.| Creation is the work
          of God alone. It must be so. If any doubt it, let us bid them make the
          effort to create the smallest object. The potter places his clay upon
          the wheel, and shapes it after his own pleasure, he fashions the vase,
          but he is not the creator of it. The clay was there beforehand, he
          does but change its shape. Will any man who thinks he can play the
          creator, produce a single grain of dust? Call now, and see if there be
          any that will answer thee -- call unto nothingness, and bid a grain of
          dust appear at thy bidding. It cannot be. Now, inasmuch as Paul
          declares the Christian man to be a new creature, it is proven that the
          Christian man is the work of God, and the work of God alone, |Which
          were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
          of man, but of God.| The inner life of the Christian is the sole work
          of the Most High, neither can any pretend to put his finger thereto to
          help the Creator. In creation, who helped God? who poised the clouds
          for Him? who weighed the hills in scales to aid His skill, or helped
          Him dig the channels of the sea? Who aided in rolling the stars along?
          who took a torch to light up the lamps of heaven? With whom took the
          Almighty counsel, and who instructed him? If there be any that can
          stand with God in the making of the world, then may some pretend to
          compare with Him in the conversion of souls, but until that shall be,
          the new creation is God's sole domain, and in it His attributes, and
          His attributes alone, shine resplendent. |It is not of him that
          willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.| The
          sovereign will of God creates men heirs of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brethren, it was more difficult, if such terms are ever applicable
          to Omnipotence, it was more difficult to create a Christian than to
          create a world. What was there to begin with when God made the world?
          There was nothing; but nothing could not stand in God's way -- it was
          at least passive. But, my brethren, in our hearts, while there was
          nothing that could help God, there was much that could and did oppose
          Him. Our stubborn wills, our deep prejudices, our ingrained love of
          iniquity, all these, great God, opposed thee, and aimed at thwarting
          thy designs. There was darkness in the first creation, but that
          darkness could not obstruct the incoming of light. |Light be!| was the
          eternal fiat, and light was. But, O great God, how often has thy voice
          spoken to us and our darkness has refused thy light! We loved darkness
          rather than light, because our deeds were evil; and it was only when
          thou didst put on the garments of thine omnipotence, and come forth in
          the glory of thy strength, that at the last our soul yielded to thy
          light, and the abysmal darkness of our natural depravity made way for
          thy celestial radiance. Yes, great God, it was great to make a world,
          but greater to create a new creature in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaos there was when God began to fit up this world for man; confusion
          dire, disorder rampant. But the Spirit of God moved on the face of the
          deep, and brought order speedily, for chaos could not resist the
          Spirit. But, alas! the disorder of our soul was stout in resistance to
          the order of God. We would not have His ways nor yield to His
          commands; but even as we could we set our faces like a flint against
          the will and power and majesty of the Eternal. Yet hath He subdued us,
          yet hath He made us the creatures of His mercy. Unto Him, then, be
          glory and strength! Unto Him be praise, world without end!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the creation of the old world God first gave light, and afterwards
          he created life -- the life that crept, the life that walked, the life
          that dived, the life that flew in the midst of heaven. So hath He
          wrought in our hearts; He hath given us the life that creeps upon the
          ground in humiliation for sin; the life that walks in service, the
          life that swims in sacred waters of repentance, the life that flies on
          the wings of faith in the midst of heaven; and, as God separated the
          light from the darkness, and the dry land from the sea, so in the new
          creature He hath separated the old depravity from the new life. He
          hath given to us a holy and incorruptible life which is for ever
          separated from, and opposed to, the old natural death; and at last,
          when the old creation was all but finished, God brought forth man in
          His own image as the topstone. A like work He will do in us as His new
          creatures. Having given us light, and life, and order, He will renew
          in us the image of God. Yea, that image is in every man who is in
          Christ Jesus at this hour. Though it is not yet complete, the
          outlines, as it were, are there. The great Sculptor has begun to
          chisel out the image of Himself in this rough block of human marble;
          you cannot see all the features, the lineaments divine are not yet
          apparent; still, because it is in His design, the Master seeth what we
          see not; He seeth in our unhewn nature His own perfect likeness as it
          is to be revealed in the day of the revealing of our Lord and Saviour
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, dear brethren, I have tried to show you that the work which
          wrought in us when we come to be in Christ Jesus, is a divine work,
          because it is a new creation. I shall pause here again, and say to
          each hearer, Dost thou know what it is to be under God's hand, and to
          be wrought by God's workmanship? Strangers to God must be strangers to
          heaven. Beloved, if you have no more religion than you have worked out
          in yourself, and no more grace than you have found in your nature, you
          have none at all. A supernatural work of the Holy Ghost must be
          wrought in every one of us, if we would see the face of God with
          acceptance. This change is assuredly wrought in every man that is in
          Christ Jesus. If thou believest in the Lord Jesus, this work is begun
          and shall be carried on in thee; but if thou hast nothing about thee
          but thine own strivings and resolvings, thine own prayings and
          reformings, thou fallest short of the glory of God, and thou hast not
          that which will be a passport to the skies. God grant you yet to have
          it. I pray God His truth may go right through and through your souls
          like refining fire, and may you not be satisfied unless a true new
          birth, the work of the living God, be really in your possession even
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall now come to the third point which the singular expression of
          the text brings up. The expression |a new creature,| indicates
          remarkable freshness. It is very long since this world saw a new
          creature. If geologists tell true, there have been several series of
          creatures in different periods of time, and each race has given place
          to another race of new creatures fresh from creation's mint, new from
          God's hand. But it is now six thousand years at least, and some of us
          think many thousand years more, since the day when this last set of
          creatures came into this world, and started upon the race of life: all
          the creatures we now see are old and antiquated. The flower which
          springs from the soil, is the repetition of its like which bloomed
          five thousand years ago. Yonder meads bedecked with yellow king-cups
          and fair daisies are the facsimiles of those our sires looked upon
          three score years ago. As for ourselves, removed by long lines of
          pedigree from the man whom Jehovah formed in the garden, we by nature
          show small signs of the undefiled hand and sacred finger. The world is
          hackneyed and stale and old. Time wearily drags on to its Saturday
          night, it draws near to the last of its work-days with heavy
          footsteps. Any new creature coming fresh into the world would startle
          and amaze us all. What would men give if the Almighty hand would form
          a novelty in life, and send it among us; and yet, ye Athenian wits,
          that are for ever seeking after some new thing, the text tells you
          that there are new creatures upon earth, positive new creations,
          fruits that have the freshness and bloom of Eden about them, flowers
          unfaded, life with the dew of its youth upon it; and these new
          creatures are Christian men; these new creatures fresh from the divine
          hand, as though just fashioned between the eternal palms, are the men
          that weep for sin, the inca that confess their iniquity, the men that
          say, |God be merciful to us, sinners,| the men who rest in the blood
          of the atonement, the men who love Christ Jesus, and live to the glory
          of the Most High; these are new creatures. There is a freshness about
          them; they have just come from the hand of God, they enjoy nearness to
          God, they get to the fountain-head of life, and drink where the
          crystal stream is cool and clear, and not mudded by long trickling
          through earthly channels. There is a freshness, I say, about them
          which is to be found nowhere else. I do believe this, believe it
          because I have experienced it. This world's a dream, an empty show;
          there is nothing lasting beneath the stars, everything of seeming joy
          soon palls upon the mind. Take to study, and ransack all the learned
          tomes, and your mind will soon be satiated with knowledge. Take to
          travel, and behold the fairest realms, climb the summits of the Alps,
          or traverse the valleys with all their picturesque beauty, and you
          will soon say, |I have exhausted all, I know it, I am weary of it.|
          Follow what pursuit you will, like Solomon you may get to yourself
          gardens and palaces, singing men and singing women; or you may, if
          your folly be great enough, give yourself to wine; or if you will,
          addict yourself to commerce; but of the whole you will say ere long,
          |Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.| The world is but a mirage; it
          melts, it disappears as the traveller passes on, and mocks his thirst
          with the deceptive image of the true. But, beloved, the spiritual life
          is not so. There is a freshness, a vivacity, a force, an energy, a
          power about it that never grows stale. He that prayed yesterday with
          joy, shall pray in fifty years' time, if he be on earth, with the
          selfsame delight. He that loves his Maker, and feels his heart beat
          high at the mention of the name of Jesus, shall find as much transport
          in that name, if he lives to the age of Methuselah, as he doth now.
          Year by year its sweets grow sweeter, its lights grow brighter, its
          novelties grow fresher, its joys more joyous, and its exhilarations
          more intense. We dance yet before the ark. While heart and flesh are
          failing the spirit gathers new strength, and joy gathers growing
          force. Let us seek after this new creatureship, this new power, this
          fresh life, this ever-vigorous youth, that laughs at decrepit earth
          and worn out time; this new life which counts even sun, and moon, and
          stars, but dying things, like flickering lamps smoking out their lives
          for want of oil; while the life divine, since it is fed by God, wears
          within it a secret immortality which death, and hell, and time, cannot
          impair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I shall appeal to you again. Do you know anything about this
          freshness? If you do, you will find that the world does not understand
          you. A new creature put into this world, would be in a very strange
          position, from the mere fact of its being a new creature. Believer,
          you will find that the world does not suit you as it once did. You
          will be out of your element, pining for another world; for there must
          needs be a new world to suit a new creature. Do you feel pantings
          after the new world? God will not give you what He has not taught you
          to long for, but your cravings and longings are the shadows of the
          coming mercy. Ask yourselves whether you know these mysteries. If you
          do not, may the Lord teach you; and if you do, praise and bless his
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude. This subject leads us to two things. It leads us to
          self-examination. May I press upon every one to search himself,
          whether he knoweth what this being made a new creature means! But I
          will not detain you on this point, lest I weary you on this sultry
          morning. Pursue practically the exhortation I fail to enlarge upon
          verbally.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would lead you to another thought, on which I will dwell for a
          moment. Our subject excites hope in the Christian. If God has made a
          new creature of him, which is the greatest work of grace, will he not
          do the lesser work of grace -- namely, make the new creature grow up
          unto perfection? If the Lord has turned you to himself, never be
          afraid that He will leave you to perish. If He had meant to destroy
          you, he would not have done this for you. God does not make creatures
          for annihilation. Chemists tell us that though many things are
          resolved into their primary gases by fire, yet there is not a particle
          less matter on the earth today than there was when it was created. No
          spiritual life that comes from God is ever annihilated. If you have
          obtained it, it never shall be taken from you -- it shall be in you a
          well of water springing up unto everlasting life. If when you were an
          enemy, God looked upon you in grace, and changed you, and made you
          what you now are, will He not now that you are reconciled continue to
          preserve and nurture you till He presents you faultless before His
          presence with exceeding great joy? The Lord grant it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other word of hope, and it is this: If salvation be entirely a
          creation of God, if God alone can work it, what hope this ought to
          give the most forlorn sinner! Ah! my dear friend, if your salvation
          rested on you, you might well despair. Chaos, if it remained with thee
          to make order, order could never be! Darkness, if it were thine to
          create the light, light could never shine! But God's fiat brings forth
          order and light. Sinner, if it were for thee to make thyself a saint,
          and work out thine own salvation alone, thou mightst well despair; but
          it is God's work, and He can do whatsoever He will. He can instantly
          dispel thy gloom, He can immediately overcome thine unbelief. He can
          change thy heart, He can make thee, the greatest of sinners, to become
          the brightest of saints. Lift up thy heart to Him. He heareth prayer.
          Heaven's gate is open. Seek, for he that seeketh findeth, and to him
          that knocketh it shall be opened; and God bless thee, for Christ's
          sake Amen.
