          1. But that our faith was also prefigured in Abraham, and that he was
          the patriarch of our faith, and, as it were, the prophet of it, the
          apostle has very fully taught, when he says in the Epistle to the
          Galatians: |He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and
          worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or
          by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was
          accounted unto him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they
          which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. But the
          Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through
          faith, announced beforehand unto Abraham, that in him all nations
          should be blessed. So then they which be of faith shall be blessed
          with faithful Abraham.| For which [reasons the apostle] declared that
          this man was not only the prophet of faith, but also the father of
          those who from among the Gentiles believe in Jesus Christ, because his
          faith and ours are one and the same: for he believed in things future,
          as if they were already accomplished, because of the promise of God;
          and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of God, behold
          through faith that inheritance [laid up for us] in the [future]
          kingdom.

          2. The history of Isaac, too, is not without a symbolical character.
          For in the Epistle to the Romans, the apostle declares: |Moreover,
          when Rebecca had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,| she
          received answer from the Word, |that the purpose of God according to
          election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was
          said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people
          are in thy body; and the one people shall overcome the other, and the
          elder shall serve the younger.| From which it is evident, that not
          only [were there] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the
          children brought forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two
          nations; and that the one should be indeed the greater, but the other
          the less; that the one also should be under bondage, but the other
          free; but [that both should be] of one and the same father. Our God,
          one and the same, is also their God, who knows hidden things, who
          knoweth all things before they can come to pass; and for this reason
          has He said, |Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.|

        <p>
          3. If any one, again, will look into Jacob's actions, he shall find
          them not destitute of meaning, but full of import with regard to the
          dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his birth, since he laid
          hold on his brother's heel, he was called Jacob, that is, the
          supplanter -- one who holds, but is not held; binding the feet, but
          not being bound; striving and conquering; grasping in his hand his
          adversary's heel, that is, victory. For to this end was the Lord born,
          the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand, of whom also John
          says in the Apocalypse: |He went forth conquering, that He should
          conquer.| In the next place, [Jacob] received the rights of the
          first-born, when his brother looked on them with contempt; even as
          also the younger nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when
          the elder nation rejected Him, saying, |We have no king but CÃ¦sar.|
          But in Christ every blessing [is summed up], and therefore the latter
          people has snatched away the blessings of the former from the Father,
          just as Jacob took away the blessing of this Esau. For which cause his
          brother suffered the plots and persecutions of a brother, just as the
          Church suffers this self-same thing from the Jews. In a foreign
          country were the twelve tribes born, the race of Israel, inasmuch as
          Christ was also, in a strange country, to generate the twelve-pillared
          foundation of the Church. Various coloured sheep were allotted to this
          Jacob as his wages; and the wages of Christ are human beings, who from
          various and diverse nations come together into one cohort of faith, as
          the Father promised Him, saying, |Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the
          heathen for Thine inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for
          Thy possession.| And as from the multitude of his sons the prophets of
          the Lord [afterwards] arose, there was every necessity that Jacob
          should beget sons from the two sisters, even as Christ did from the
          two laws of one and the same Father; and in like manner also from the
          handmaids, indicating that Christ should raise up sons of God, both
          from freemen and from slaves after the flesh, bestowing upon all, in
          the same manner, the gift of the Spirit, who vivifies us. But he
          (Jacob) did all things for the sake of the younger, she who had the
          handsome eyes, Rachel, who prefigured the Church, for which Christ
          endured patiently; who at that time, indeed, by means of His
          patriarchs and prophets, was prefiguring and declaring beforehand
          future things, fulfilling His part by anticipation in the
          dispensations of God, and accustoming His inheritance to obey God, and
          to pass through the world as in a state of pilgrimage, to follow His
          word, and to indicate beforehand things to come. For with God there is
          nothing without purpose or due signification.<br />
