          1. That system, then, which has respect to their Pleroma, and
          especially that part of it which refers to the primary Ogdoad being
          thus burdened with so great contradictions and perplexities, let me
          now go on to examine the remainder of their scheme. [In doing so] on
          account of their madness, I shall be making inquiry respecting things
          which have no real existence; yet it is necessary to do this, since
          the treatment of this subject has been entrusted to me, and since I
          desire all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, as well as
          because thou thyself hast asked to receive from me full and complete
          means for overturning [the views of] these men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I ask, then, in what manner were the rest of the Æons produced? Was
          it so as to be united with Him who produced them, even as the solar
          rays are with the sun; or was it actually and separately, so that each
          of them possessed an independent existence and his own special form,
          just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle from
          another? Or was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a
          tree? And were they of the same substance with those who produced
          them, or did they derive their substance from some other [kind of]
          substance? Also, were they produced at the same time, so as to be
          contemporaries; or after a certain order, so that some of them were
          older, and others younger? And, again, are they uncompounded and
          uniform, and altogether equal and similar among themselves, as spirit
          and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike
          [to each other] in their members?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If each of them was produced, after the manner of men, actually and
          according to its own generation, then either those thus generated by
          the Father will be of the same substance with Him, and similar to
          their Author; or if they appear dissimilar, then it must of necessity
          be acknowledged that they are [formed] of some different substance.
          Now, if the beings generated by the Father be similar to their Author,
          then those who have been produced must remain for ever impassible,
          even as is He who produced them; but if, on the other hand, they are
          of a different substance, which is capable of passion, then whence
          came this dissimilar substance to find a place within the
          incorruptible Pleroma? Further, too, according to this principle, each
          one of them must be understood as being completely separated from
          every other, even as men are not mixed with nor united the one to the
          other, but each having a distinct shape of his own, and a definite
          sphere of action, while each one of them, too, is formed of a
          particular size, -- qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a
          spirit. Let them therefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being
          spiritual, or of themselves as |spiritual,| if indeed their Æons sit
          feasting with the Father, just as if they were men, and He Himself is
          of such a configuration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, again, the Æons were derived from Logos, Logos from Nous, and
          Nous from Bythus, just as lights are kindled from a light -- as, for
          example, torches are from a torch -- then they may no doubt differ in
          generation and size from one another; but since they are of the same
          substance with the Author of their production, they must either all
          remain for ever impassible, or their Father Himself must participate
          in passion. For the torch which has been kindled subsequently cannot
          be possessed of a different kind of light from that which preceded it.
          Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the
          original identity, since that one light is then formed which has
          existed even from the beginning. But we cannot speak, with respect to
          light itself, of some part being more recent in its origin, and
          another being more ancient (for the whole is but one light); nor can
          we so speak even in regard to those torches which have received the
          light (for these are all contemporary as respects their material
          substance, for the substance of torches is one and the same), but
          simply as to [the time of] its being kindled, since one was lighted a
          little while ago, and another has just now been kindled.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The defect, therefore, of that passion which has regard to
          ignorance, will either attach alike to their whole Pleroma, since [all
          its members] are of the same substance; and the Propator will share in
          this defect of ignorance -- that is, will be ignorant of Himself; or,
          on the other hand, all those lights which are within the Pleroma will
          alike remain for ever impassible. Whence, then, comes the passion of
          the youngest Æon, if the light of the Father is that from which all
          other lights have been formed, and which is by nature impassible? And
          how can one Æon be spoken of as either younger or older among
          themselves, since there is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And if
          any one calls them stars, they will all nevertheless appear to
          participate in the same nature. For if |one star differs from another
          star in glory,| but not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact
          of being passible or impassible; so all these, since they are alike
          derived from the light of the Father, must either be naturally
          impassible and immutable, or they must all, in common with the light
          of the Father, be passible, and are capable of the varying phases of
          corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The same conclusion will follow, although they affirm that the
          production of Æons sprang from Logos, as branches from a tree, since
          Logos has his generation from their Father. For all [the Æons] are
          formed of the same substance with the Father, differing from one
          another only in size, and not in nature, and filling up the greatness
          of the Father, even as the fingers complete the hand. If therefore He
          exists in passion and ignorance, so must also those Æons who have been
          generated by Him. But if it is impious to ascribe ignorance and
          passion to the Father of all, how can they describe an Æon produced by
          Him as being passible; and while they ascribe the same impiety to the
          very wisdom (Sophia) of God, how can they still call themselves
          religious men?
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If, again, they declare that their Æons were sent forth just as
          rays are from the sun, then, since all are of the same substance and
          sprung from the same source, all must either be capable of passion
          along with Him who produced them, or all will remain impassible for
          ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of beings so produced,
          some are impassible and others passible. If, then, they declare all
          impassible, they do themselves destroy their own argument. For how
          could the youngest Æon have suffered passion if all were impassible?
          If, on the other hand, they declare that all partook of this passion,
          as indeed some of them venture to maintain, then, inasmuch as it
          originated with Logos, but flowed onwards to Sophia, they will thus be
          convicted of tracing back the passion to Logos, who is the Nous of
          this Propator, and so acknowledging the Nous of the Propator and the
          Father Himself to have experienced passion. For the Father of all is
          not to be regarded as a kind of compound Being, who can be separated
          from his Nous (mind), as I have already shown; but Nous is the Father,
          and the Father Nous. It necessarily follows, therefore, both that he
          who springs from Him as Logos, or rather that Nous himself, since he
          is Logos, must be perfect and impassible, and that those productions
          which proceed from him, seeing that they are of the same substance
          with himself, should be perfect and impassible, and should ever remain
          similar to him who produced them.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It cannot therefore longer be held, as these men teach, that Logos,
          as occupying the third place in generation, was ignorant of the
          Father. Such a thing might indeed perhaps be deemed probable in the
          case of the generation of human beings, inasmuch as these frequently
          know nothing of their parents; but it is altogether impossible in the
          case of the Logos of the Father. For if, existing in the Father, he
          knows Him in whom he exists -- that is, is not ignorant of himself --
          then those productions which issue from him being his powers
          (faculties), and always present with him, will not be ignorant of him
          who emitted them, any more than rays [may be supposed to be] of the
          sun. It is impossible, therefore, that the Sophia (wisdom) of God, she
          who is within the Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been produced in such a
          manner, should have fallen under the influence of passion, and
          conceived such ignorance. But it is possible that that Sophia (wisdom)
          who pertains to [the scheme] of Valentinus, inasmuch as she is a
          production of the devil, should fall into every kind of passion, and
          exhibit the profoundest ignorance. For when they themselves bear
          testimony concerning their mother, to the effect that she was the
          offspring of an erring Æon, we need no longer search for a reason why
          the sons of such a mother should be ever swimming in the depths of
          ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. I am not aware that, besides these productions [which have been
          mentioned], they are able to speak of any other; indeed, they have not
          been known to me (although I have had very frequent discussions with
          them concerning forms of this kind) as ever setting forth any other
          peculiar kind of being as produced [in the manner under
          consideration]. This only they maintain, that each one of these was so
          produced as to know merely that one who produced him, while he was
          ignorant of the one who immediately preceded. But they do not in this
          matter go forward [in their account] with any kind of demonstration as
          to the manner in which these were produced, or how such a thing could
          take place among spiritual beings. For, in whatsoever way they may
          choose to go forward, they will feel themselves bound (while, as
          regards the truth, they depart entirely from right reason) to proceed
          so far as to maintain that their Word, who springs from the Nous of
          the Propator, -- to maintain, I say, that he was produced in a state
          of degeneracy. For [they hold] that perfect Nous, previously begotten
          by the perfect Bythus, was not capable of rendering that production
          which issued from him perfect, but [could only bring it forth] utterly
          blind to the knowledge and greatness of the Father. They also maintain
          that the Saviour exhibited an emblem of this mystery in the case of
          that man who was blind from his birth, since the Æon was in this
          manner produced by Monogenes blind, that is, in ignorance, thus
          falsely ascribing ignorance and blindness to the Word of God, who,
          according to their own theory, holds the second [place of] production
          from the Propator. Admirable sophists, and explorers of the
          sublimities of the unknown Father, and rehearsers of those
          super-celestial mysteries |which the angels desire to look into!| --
          that they may learn that from the Nous of that Father who is above
          all, the Word was produced blind, that is, ignorant of the Father who
          produced him!
        </p>
        <p>
          10. But, ye miserable sophists, how could the Nous of the Father, or
          rather the very Father Himself, since He is Nous and perfect in all
          things, have produced his own Logos as an imperfect and blind Æon,
          when He was able also to produce along with him the knowledge of the
          Father? As ye affirm that Christ was generated after the rest, and yet
          declare that he was produced perfect, much more then should Logos, who
          is anterior to him in age, be produced by the same Nous,
          unquestionably perfect, and not blind; nor could he, again, have
          produced Æons still blinder than himself, until at last your Sophia,
          always utterly blinded, gave birth to so vast a body of evils. And
          your Father is the cause of all this mischief; for ye declare the
          magnitude and power of your Father to be the causes of ignorance,
          assimilating Him to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him who is
          the unnameable Father. But if ignorance is an evil, and ye declare all
          evils to have derived their strength from it, while ye maintain that
          the greatness and power of the Father is the cause of this ignorance,
          ye do thus set Him forth as the author of [all] evils. For ye state as
          the cause of evil this fact, that [no one] could contemplate His
          greatness. But if it was really impossible for the Father to make
          Himself known from the beginning to those [beings] that were formed by
          Him, He must in that case be held free from blame, inasmuch as He
          could not remove the ignorance of those who came after Him. But if, at
          a subsequent period, when He so willed it, He could take away that
          ignorance which had increased with the successive productions as they
          followed each other, and thus become deeply seated in the Æons, much
          more, had He so willed it might He formerly have prevented that
          ignorance, which as yet was not, from coming into existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Since therefore, as soon as He so pleased, He did become known not
          only to the Æons, but also to these men who lived in these latter
          times; but, as He did not so please to be known from the beginning, He
          remained unknown -- the cause of ignorance is, according to you, the
          will of the Father. For if He foreknew that these things would in
          future happen in such a manner, why then did He not guard against the
          ignorance of these beings before it had obtained a place among them,
          rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of repentance, deal
          with it through the production of Christ? For the knowledge which
          through Christ He conveyed to all, He might long before have imparted
          through Logos, who was also the first-begotten of Monogenes. Or if,
          knowing them beforehand, He willed that these things should happen [as
          they have done], then the works of ignorance must endure for ever, and
          never pass away. For the things which have been made in accordance
          with the will of your Propator must continue along with the will of
          Him who willed them; or if they pass away, the will of Him also who
          decreed that they should have a being will pass away along with them.
          And why did the Æons find rest and attain perfect knowledge through
          learning [at last] that the Father is altogether incomprehensible?
          They might surely have possessed this knowledge before they became
          involved in passion; for the greatness of the Father did not suffer
          diminution from the beginning, so that these might know that He was
          altogether incomprehensible. For if, on account of His infinite
          greatness, He remained unknown, He ought also on account of His
          infinite love to have preserved those impassible who were produced by
          Him, since nothing hindered, and expediency rather required, that they
          should have known from the beginning that the Father was altogether
          incomprehensible.<br />
