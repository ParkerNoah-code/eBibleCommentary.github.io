        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2050)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, November 4th, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|When I am weak, then am I strong.| -- 2 Corinthians 12:10.</p>
        <p>
          The expression is paradoxical, and seems somewhat singular; yet it was
          the experience of the apostle Paul, a man of calm spirit, by no means
          fanciful, a wise man, and far removed from a fanatic. It was the
          experience of one who was led of the Spirit of God, and therefore it
          was a gracious experience: the experience of one who was a father in
          Israel, who could safely bid us to be imitators of him, even as he
          imitated the Lord Jesus Christ; and therefore it was a safe
          experience. If we are weak, so was Paul; and if, like him, we are
          strong in our weakness, we shall be in the best of company. If the
          same things be seen in us which were wrought in the apostle of the
          Gentiles, we may join with him in glorying in infirmities, because the
          power of Christ doth rest upon us, and we may count ourselves happy
          that with such a saint we can cry, |When I am weak, then am I strong.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Perhaps I can expound the text best if I first TURN IT THE OTHER
          WAY UP, and use it as a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am strong, then am I weak. Perhaps, while thinking of the text
          thus turned inside out, we shall be getting light upon it to be used
          when we view it with the right side outwards, and see that when we are
          weak, then we are strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am quite sure that some people think themselves very strong, and are
          not so. Their proud consciousness of fancied strength is the
          indication of a terrible weakness. We have among us certain persons
          who think that they can do all that is needful for their own salvation
          whenever they please to do so. They can perform all sorts of good
          works, or at least quite enough to carry them to heaven. Their first
          idea is that they are to be saved by their own doings; and they really
          expect to be so saved. They may admit that they have a few faults and
          flaws in their character; but these are so trifling as to be hardly
          worth mentioning, and God Almighty is too merciful to be very
          particular. Their lives have been excellent, their tempers amiable,
          their manners courteous, their spirit generous, and they quite believe
          that by keeping on at the same pace they will win the prize: if they
          do not, who will? The ship of their character is in fine condition;
          they have no leaks which the pumps cannot keep down; their sails are
          not rent, and they hope to sail into the haven of peace with a
          glorious cargo of merit, having an abundant entrance, and hearing a
          loud, |Well done!| Ah, my friend! that consciousness of legal strength
          is a mere delusion, and it will have to be taken out of you. There is
          no going to heaven that way -- by self and the works of self. Your
          error is a common one, but it is fatal. I have seen many epitaphs of
          persons, placed by the mistaken kindness of friends upon their
          tombstones, which I felt sure would have been sufficient to shut them
          out of heaven if they had been true. These departed worthies do not
          appear to have been sinners at all: their virtues were superlative,
          their faults non-existent. Such wonderful people would appear from
          their epitaphs to have flown up to the gates of heaven upon the wings
          of their own virtues, and to have entered there without a passport of
          mercy, as burgesses by their own right of the New Jerusalem. I wonder
          how they would behave themselves in heaven, if they were really
          admitted there! All the rest are singing, |We have washed our robes,
          and made them white in the blood of the Lamb|; but these needed no
          washing, and so they would be likely to strike up a little song by
          themselves, and sing, |Our robes never needed washing; we kept them
          white as snow.| What a discord that would create in the music of the
          skies! What a division of character and feeling would be found among
          celestials! I cannot see how there could be any harmony of sentiment
          amongst sinners saved by grace and righteous ones who owed nothing to
          mercy, nothing to the atoning sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, my strong and virtuous hearer, you are under a grave delusion.
          There is a great similarity between your talk and the talk of that
          religious individual who went up to the temple in our Saviour's days,
          and, standing before the thrice-holy God, dared to say, |God, I thank
          thee that I am not as other men are.| He was not justified that day,
          nor will you be. A poor tax-gatherer, despised by himself, and an
          off-cast from his own people, stood in the temple at the same time,
          and all that he dared to say was, |God be merciful to me a sinner.|
          This unworthy sinner when to his house justified, while the other
          worthy person was not accepted. If you think yourselves strong enough
          to procure heaven by your own efforts, you are ignorantly insulting
          the cross of Christ, for you seem to insinuate that your virtues can
          avail you without Jesus. If you really mean this, there is no more
          venom of rebellion against God in your self-righteousness than in the
          outward vice of those who make no pretence to godliness. For you to
          put your works in the place of Jesus is a blasphemy against the
          Saviour's blood and righteousness. Why needed Christ to die if men
          could save themselves? Why need he bleed upon the cross if your merits
          will suffice to gain you a place among the blessed? There is a fatal
          weakness in the claim of that man who thinks himself strong enough to
          force his own passage to the throne of God; that weakness lies in the
          pride which insults the Crucified, the disloyalty which prefers itself
          to the royal Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>|Perish the virtue, as it ought -- abhorred,</p>
        <p>And the fool with it who insults his Lord.|</p>
        <p>
          Listen to me a moment, and quit your fancied strength: you, my hearer,
          cannot keep the law of God, for you have already broken it. How can
          you preserve a crystal vase entire when you have already dashed it to
          atoms? You must now be saved by the merits and the strength of
          another, or not at all; for your own merit is out of the question,
          through past failure. That strength of yours, upon which you dote so
          much, is perfect weakness. May the Lord show you this, and make you
          faint at heart on that account; for then you shall be strong, with
          real and saving strength! Now your imaginary strength is making you
          really weak, and that boasted merit of yours is shutting you out from
          true righteousness. He that is strong in the notion of merit is weak
          even to utter folly before the God of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Yes,| we hear you reply, |there is a gospel way of salvation. We know
          that there is, for you preach it continually. You tell us that men
          must repent, and believe the gospel; that they must be renewed in the
          spirit of their minds, and must both overcome sin, and follow after
          holiness.| Yes, I do say all that; but what do you say to it? Is it
          really so that you find here a ground for your own strength? Do you
          say, |I feel that I can repent whenever I please, and believe in Jesus
          when I choose?| Ah! then I must assure you that when you are strong in
          that way, you are weak. I never yet knew anybody repent who gloried in
          his power to repent; I never yet knew a man heart-broken for sin who
          boasted that he could break his own heart when and where he pleased.
          |What!| cries one, |surely I can believe in Jesus Christ when I
          please!| I have not denied that statement, have I? But I tell you that
          your notion of power to believe is your weakness; and I would rather
          by half hear you cry, with deep solemnity, |Oh, that God would give me
          faith! Lord, help my unbelief!| Your sense of inability to believe in
          Christ would be a far better token for good, in my judgment, than your
          present flippant talk about believing when you like. Men who are in
          earnest talk not so: whatever their strength may be, they find it
          little enough in the hour of need. I beg to assure you that I have
          never known a man believe in Jesus who trusted that he could so
          believe; for his trust in his own believing kept him from trusting to
          Jesus; but I have known many a poor, struggling soul lie at the
          cross-foot, and say, |Lord, help me to look to Jesus, and live;| and
          God has helped him to give that look in which there is eternal life.
          While he has been praying, his prayer, yes, his weeping prayer, has
          had in it that very look to Jesus for which he was pleading. His sense
          of inability to believe has made him look to Jesus for believing, and
          he has found it in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          You say that you can turn your heart towards God whenever you please.
          I am not going into any dispute with you about your assertion, nor the
          doctrine, which is supposed to support you in your profession of
          strength; but I will say this, that your idea of having personal
          strength, with which to purify and renew your own heart -- your idea
          that you can create in yourself a right spirit -- your idea that you
          can raise yourself from your death in sin -- is to me a prophecy of
          much evil for yourself. where self is conspicuous, I see an omen of
          mischief, I see no good in this fine opinion of yourself; but if I
          heard you cry, |Create in me a clean heart, O God| -- if I heard you
          say, |Lord, quicken me out of my death in sin| -- if I saw you lying
          down before the Most High, and praying, |Turn me, and I shall be
          turned| -- I should have a far brighter hope of you. In your weakness
          you would become strong; but in your present strength, I am sure I see
          a great weakness, which is likely to be your ruin. O dear hearts, your
          best friend does not lie within your own doors. Your hope for better
          things shines yonder at the right hand of God, where the living
          Saviour has all power given to him in heaven and earth. Sinner, if you
          grow no sweeter flowers than the dunghill of your own nature can
          nourish, you will die amid poisonous weeds. If you never drink of
          better water than the filthy well of your own heart will yield, you
          will perish of thirst, or of a deadly draught. Another, and a better
          helper than one born in your house, must come this way. Help must be
          laid upon one that is mighty, exalted of the Lord out of the people,
          and endowed with divine power and Godhead, for only such a Saviour,
          infinitely good and great, can save a soul so lost as yours. When you
          get down, down, down, into utter weakness, then you will be strong,
          because then you will rest upon the Lord's salvation; but as you are
          strong in your thoughts of yourself, you are kept from Jesus, and are
          weakness itself.
        </p>
        <p>So far I have spoken by way of warning to unconverted people.</p>
        <p>
          I desire now to say a word to those who profess to be Christians, and,
          let us hope, are so; but they are, in a measure, erring in the same
          way as those to whom I have spoken. They are remarkably strong: at
          least in their own esteem they are very Samsons, although others fear
          that the Philistines will capture them. By this token may they know
          their own weakness -- even by this, that they think themselves strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, many are wonderfully strong as to knowledge. They know almost
          everything. If in any department they are a little short, they make up
          for it by knowing so much more in the other direction. If they are too
          narrow here, they overlap there. They are knowing men, and need no man
          to tell them so. They are instructed in the faith from pole to pole:
          they know both that which is afar off, and that which is nigh. An
          argument is a pleasure to them. They go into company where the eternal
          verities are denied, and feel a delight in taking sides. They will sit
          where the vital simplicities of God's word are set up like marks for
          boys to throw at; and they like the amusement, for it exercises their
          knowing faculty, and gives them a chance of showing their mental
          power. They are not children, but quite able to think for themselves.
          They are not credulous, but amazingly clear-headed and cultured. I
          have noticed these fine gentlemen have been the first to deny the
          faith, and to fall into all manner of heresies. Do you wonder? Those
          who are so very sure are always the most uncertain. I could instance
          some that had such confidence in themselves that they would have
          argued with the very fiend of hell on any question, for they felt that
          not even Satanic craft could conquer them; but at this present moment
          the prince of darkness holds them in his power. They hold no
          controversy with the devil now, for they are very largely agreed with
          him in assailing the gospel of God's grace. They have gone entirely
          over to the denial of everything that is gracious and holy and
          scriptural, and the main cause of their apostasy is their own
          invincible self-confidence. They were so strong that they became
          weaker than others. O brethren, when we are very wise in our own
          esteem, we are bordering upon fools, even if we have not already
          entered into that company. When we tremblingly sit at Jesus' feet, to
          learn everything afresh, and fresh from him; when we shudder at
          anything that questions his Deity, or lowers his sacrifice; when we
          shut up a book and cast it from us, because we feel that it pollutes
          us with unbelief -- then are we wise and strong. When the Word of the
          Lord is enough, then are we in the way of wisdom and strength. The man
          of one book is proverbially a terrible mon; but the man of ten
          thousand books, who can baffle all adversaries and foil all foes,
          shall soon lie wounded on the plain, if he be not slain outright. Let
          us take heed unto ourselves, that we fall not through being
          headstrong, or strong in the head, which is much the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, I have noticed some professedly Christian people wonderfully
          strong through experience. Their experience has been very extensive,
          and the knowledge it has brought them they consider to be specially
          profound, and, consequently, they are not afraid of temptation, for
          they feel that they are too wise to be entrapped. They are so
          experienced now, that things which young people ought not to think of,
          they can do with impunity -- so they foolishly dream. They can go just
          so far, and then stop, for they are fitted with the patent brakes of
          prudence. They are such good mountain climbers that they can stand on
          the edge of a precipice, and look over, and even hang over, without
          fear of their ever being giddy and falling over. Of course they would
          not advise other people to go quite so far as they may safely go; but
          then, what is temptation to other men is no temptation to them. Their
          vessel is so tight and trim, and they understand navigation so
          perfectly, that they rather like a tempest than not, just to show how
          well their vessel can behave in a storm. Ah me! When you next read the
          list of wrecks, you may expect to see the name of their ship among the
          castaways. Old birds may not be caught with chaff, but they can be
          shot with a gun. No one is out of danger, and no one is more in danger
          than the man who is carnally secure. Those who feel that their
          experience, be it what it may, only teaches them that the farther they
          can keep from temptation the better, these are in a better state. When
          experience drives us to pray with emphasis the prayer |Lead us not
          into temptation,| then it is working aright. In the idea of strength
          and wisdom lurks an awfully perilous weakness; but in a sense of
          personal weakness dwells a real strength. If you are extremely
          jealous, conscientious, and watchful, many will tell you how weak you
          are; but you are, in reality, a strong man, because of your fear to
          encounter evil influences: in that fear lies one essential element of
          holy strength. While he that rather braves temptation, because he
          feels so strong, shall find, it may be to his everlasting sorrow, how
          great his weakness is; he that shuns the appearance of evil, because
          of conscious weakness, shall find therein his security and strength.
          Oh, let none of us, because we are getting gray, suppose that we are
          vulnerable to sin! Let us not dream that because we have been
          church-members so many years, or even because we have sustained a long
          and useful ministry, we are therefore beyond gun-shot of the enemy, or
          without necessity to seek daily strength for daily duty. My brethren,
          we cannot perform the smallest duty aright apart from the help of God;
          neither can we be secure against even the grossest sin, apart from the
          perpetual guard of him that keepeth Israel. If we, in our
          self-conceit, write ourselves down among the mightiest, and forget our
          entire dependence upon heavenly grace, we may be left to prove, by
          unhappy experience, that pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty
          spirit before a fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us note another point. I have known certain Christian people who
          thought themselves singularly strong in the matter of wisdom and
          prudence. They have been gifted with clear insight and a measure of
          shrewdness, and have, therefore, felt that their judgment on most
          subjects was that of an umpire. Have you ever noticed that the raw
          material of a very grossly foolish person is a cautious individual?
          The cunning are the readiest dupes when craft is busy in taking its
          prey. So, too, a wise man is needed if there is to be exhibited the
          worst form of folly. If we were called upon to select a man who, as to
          his life as a whole, perpetrated the greatest folly, we should mention
          Solomon. Yet he was the wisest of man. Yes, the cream of wisdom, when
          curdled, makes the worst of folly. Was ever man so insanely
          enthusiastic in vain pursuits as this master of all knowledge? Then,
          brethren, whenever we feel sure of our own superior intelligence, let
          us suspect ourselves of weakness. Let the same fear come upon us when
          we feel sure about our way, so sure that we think we need not pray
          about it, or in any manner wait for divine direction. Beware of those
          matters in which you think you cannot err. Men who have been wise in
          great difficulties have blundered fearfully where all was simple. The
          Israelites thought that the men who came to them begging for a league
          of brotherhood could not deceive them. It must be safe to be on good
          terms with these interesting strangers. Why, look, their shoes are
          well-nigh worn from their feet, and patched and clouted to the last
          degree! Their clothes, which we doubt not were new when they left
          their distant homes, are now threadbare, and their biscuit, which they
          took fresh from the oven, is stale with age. It is evident, upon the
          face of it, that they must have come from a very remote part of the
          world, and therefore a treaty with them will not interfere with the
          divine command. There can be no need to pray about a case so clear.
          Thus the Gibeonites overreached them, as we also shall be overreached
          when we are so exceeding sure of our course. Brethren, let us not be
          wise as to dispense with our heavenly Counsellor and Guide. Would not
          that be the height of madness? It is a salutary thing to feel that
          your case requires you to trust the helm of your ship with the divine
          Pilot. It is even a blessed thing to feel that you are shut up to
          faith, and must by absolute trust in God throw the responsibility of
          your action upon him. I will give you an instance. Abraham, the father
          of the faithful, is placed in a peculiar position. God has commanded
          him to take his son Isaac, and offer him for a sacrifice. Here is a
          terrible puzzle. Here was enough to stagger any human mind. Surely it
          could not be right for a father to slay his son! How could it be wise
          to kill the son in whom all the promises of God were vested? The more
          you think of the case from a father's standpoint, the more it will
          perplex you. Abraham could not make any thing out of it by his
          judgment, but he met it all by faith. All that he could say to Isaac
          was, |My son, God will provide himself a Lamb.| He was thus saying to
          himself, |The Lord will get me out of this difficulty.| He had no
          wisdom with which to conjecture how the affair would end: he had to
          cease from guessing, and just trust in his God. Abraham made no
          mistake in this. Oh that we could do the same! Observe that same
          Abraham when he goes down to Egypt. His wife is exceedingly beautiful,
          and he fears that the king of Egypt will kill him in order to obtain
          his wife; what will he do? I can see a great many ways in which he
          might have warded off that evil. He was not called upon to go to Egypt
          at all, if he thereby risked his wife's honour; or, if he must go, he
          should have gone boldly, acknowledging his wife, and trusting both her
          and himself with the Lord. Instead of that, the patriarch begins by
          inducing Sarah to join with him in equivocation. |Say thou art my
          sister.| She was in some sense his sister; but it was using a word in
          a double sense for a deceitful purpose, and it was a pitiful thing for
          Abraham to do. Nor was it a prudent scheme after all: in fact it was
          the cause of the very trouble which it sought to prevent. Sarah would
          not have been taken away from Abraham at all if Pharaoh had known that
          she was his wife; so that the wise was snared by his own craftiness.
          The Lord graciously delivered him, but in that very act left a root of
          bitterness behind to be his future plague. Pharaoh gave to him women-
          servants, and I doubt not among the rest was Hagar, who became the
          object of sin, and the source of sorrow to the household. In the
          fancied strength of Abraham, by which he emulated the craft of other
          Orientals, he displayed his weakness; but in the other case, where no
          wit or wisdom could assist him, he cast himself upon the Lord, and in
          his weakness he behaved like the grand man that he really was.
          Brothers, let us confess ourselves fools, that we may be wise; for
          otherwise we shall fall into that other condition, of professing
          ourselves wise, and becoming fools. Let us ignore our wisdom, even if
          we have any. God alone is wise: he that trusteth either his own heart
          or head is a fool. Lean not to thine own understanding, but lean
          wholly upon the Lord; so shalt thou be established.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, dear friends, we shall often find that our strength will lie
          in patience -- in extreme weakness which yields itself up to the will
          of God without the power or will to murmur. We sang in our hymn just
          now --
        </p>
        <p>|And when it seems no other chance or change</p>
        <p>From grief can set me free,</p>
        <p>Hope finds its strength in helplessness,</p>
        <p>And, patient, waits on thee.|</p>
        <p>
          I am sure that in reference to power, either to do or to suffer
          rightly, we are not strong when we compliment ourselves upon our
          ability; and we are strong when, under a sense of absolute inability,
          we depend wholly upon God. That sermon preached in the glory of our
          oratory turned out to be mere husks for swine; while that discourse
          which we delivered in weakness, with a humble hope that God would use
          it, proved to be royal meat for the Lord's chosen. That work which you
          performed in the vigour of your unquestioned talent came to nothing,
          while that quiet act which you washed with your tears, and perfumed
          with your prayers, will live and yield you sheaves. Creature strength
          brings forth nothing which has life in it: only the seed which the
          Creator puts into the hand of our weakness will produce a harvest. It
          is well to be nothing: it is better still to be |less than nothing.|
          We ought to dread a sense of capacity, for it will render us
          incapable; but a sense of utter incapacity apart from God is a fit
          preparation for being used by the Lord. |Unto them that have no might
          he increaseth strength.|
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is in bearing as well as acting. If we say concerning sickness,
          |I shall never be impatient. I can bear it like a stoic.| What if
          that? You will then have done no more than many have done before you,
          with no great gain to themselves or to others. But if, bowing your
          head before the Lord, you wait his sovereign will, and say, |Lord help
          me. If thy left hand shall smite me, let thy right hand sustain me. I
          am willing to drink this bitter cup, saying, 'Not as I will, but as
          thou wilt.' Lord, help me!| -- you shall bear up triumphantly, and
          come out of the furnace refined, to the praise and the glory of your
          God. When you fancy that you are strong to suffer, you will fail; but
          in conscious weakness you will be enabled to play the man.

          I have now done with the text, as I have turned it upside down. May
          God bless it to any here who feel high and mighty, by causing it to
          put them in their proper place.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, let us take our text THE RIGHT WAY UPWARDS. |When I am weak,
          then am I strong.| |When| and |then| are the two pivots of the text --
          the hinges upon which it turns.
        </p>
        <p>
          |When I am weak.| What does that mean? It means when the believer is
          consciously weak, when he painfully feels, and distinctly recognizes
          that he is weak, then he is strong. In truth, we are always weak,
          whether we know it or not; but when we not only believe this to be the
          fact, but see it to be the fact -- then it is that we are strong. When
          it is forced home upon us, that we are less than nothing and vanity --
          when our very soul echoes and re-echoes that word, |Without me ye can
          do nothing.| -- then it is that we are strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he is growingly weak. Yes, for he sees his own weakness more and
          more clearly as he advances: as he grows stronger in faith he is much
          more conscious of the weakness of the flesh. I talked about my
          weakness from this platform five-and- twenty years ago; but I stand
          here and tremble under it now to a far greater degree than I did in my
          younger and more vigourous time. I knew it three-and-thirty years ago,
          when I first spoke to you, but I did not know it as I know it now. I
          was then weak, and I owned it: but I am now weak, and groan about it
          almost involuntarily. Yes, and I sometimes sing because of my
          weakness, learning to glory in my infirmities because the power of
          Christ doth rest upon me. When we are growingly weak, when we become
          weaker and weaker, when we seem to faint into a deeper swoon than ever
          as to our own strength, till death is written upon every power that we
          once thought we had, and we feel that we can do absolutely nothing
          apart from the Holy Spirit, then we are strong indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are strong, too, when we feel painfully weak. It is well when we
          mourn because we are so weak, and cry out to ourselves, |My weakness,
          my weakness, woe unto me! When I would do good, evil is present with
          me. When I would rise to heaven, the body of this death detains me. I
          would do great things for God, but I have no might. Alas for my
          weakness!| At such a time we are really rising, and are bringing most
          glory to God. These are growing pains -- agonies such as none know but
          the truly and growingly spiritual. A painful weakness is strength. It
          may seem a paradox, but it is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are strong when we are contritely weak. When we confess that much
          of our weakness is our fault -- a weakness which we ought to have
          overcome -- even then we have in that weakness a real strength. The
          sort of weakness that makes a man say, |I cannot be any stronger, I am
          doing my best,| is not strength but folly; but that weakness which
          makes you lament your failures and deplore your shortcomings, has in
          it a holy stimulus and force. That weakness which makes you
          dissatisfied with all you are and all you do, is goading you on to
          better and stronger things. If you feel that even when most earnest
          you have not prayed as you could wish, there is evidently strength in
          your desires, and your desires are prayers. If after any service you
          pour forth showers of penitential tears because the service was
          imperfect, there is evidently a strong soul of obedience within you.
          When you can neither repent, nor believe, nor love as you wish to do,
          you are repenting, believing, and loving with a strength which is more
          true than apparent. It is the will with which we act which is the
          strength of the action; and when the will is so powerful that it makes
          us mourn because we cannot find how to perform its bidding, then are
          we strong according to the divine measurement of strength. Contrite
          weakness is spiritual strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a man is thoroughly weak -- not only partially, but altogether
          weak -- then is he strong. When apart from the Lord Jesus, he is utter
          weakness, and nothing more -- then it is that he is strong. Let me
          persuade you to make a full confession of weakness to the Lord. Say,
          |Lord, I cannot do what I ought to do: I cannot do what I want to do:
          I cannot do what I used to do: I cannot do what other people do: I
          cannot do what I mean to do: I cannot do what I am sure I shall do: I
          cannot do what I feel impelled to do; and over this sinful weakness I
          mourn.| Then add, |Lord, I long to serve thee perfectly, yet I cannot
          do it. Unless thou help me I can do nothing aright. There will be no
          good in my actions, my words, my feelings, or my desires, unless thou
          continue to fill me with thine own holy energy. Lord, help me! Lord,
          help me!| Brother, you are strong while you plead in that fashion. You
          can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth you; and he will
          strengthen you, now that you are emptied of self. How true it is,
          |When I am weak, then am I strong!|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have brought out the |when.| Now lend me your ears and hearts for
          just a minute, while I bring out the |then.| |Then am I strong.| When
          is that?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, a man is strong when he is consciously weak, because now he has
          reached the truth. He really is weak; and if he does not know that he
          is so, he is under the influence of a falsehood. Now a lie is a thing
          of weakness. Lying strength is all fluff and foam: a mere appearance,
          a mockery, a delusion. Nothing hinders from getting the reality like
          contentment with a mere appearance. The true heart is heartily sick of
          shows and shams, and it cries, |Lord, help me to get rid of these
          shadows! Help me to come at the truth! Help me to deal with
          realities!| When you are made to feel your utter weakness you are on
          sure ground of truth -- unpleasant truth, no doubt, yet sure truth.
          You are now on safe ground touching fundamentals, and making sure
          work. What you now do will be soundly done. All the while that we keep
          building on a sandy made-up foundation, we are piling up that which
          will, in all probability, come down even faster than we put it up.
          While the rotten rubbish remains on the spot, you cannot do anything
          worth doing; but if that accumulation can be carted away, there will
          seem to be a great hole, but you will get down to the real bottom, and
          get a foundation; and then what you build will be worth putting up,
          because it will stand. Therefore, a man becomes strong when he is
          consciously weak, because he is on the truth, and is not being
          flattered by false hopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, he will be strong because he will only go with a commission to
          support him. He will not be eager to run without being sent. He says
          within himself, when he proposes a service to himself, |No, I am too
          weak to undertake anything of my own head.| He will wait for a call.
          This is not the kind of man that will climb up into a pulpit, and from
          a dizzy brain pour out nonsense. He will not crave to lead, for he
          feels that he needs much help even to follow. He feels himself too
          weak to set up for a master in Israel. This is not the kind of man
          that will venture into argument with sceptics for the fun or for the
          glory of the thing. Oh, no; he is too weak for that. He says, |If I am
          called to defend the faith, I will do it in God's strength, hoping
          that it will be given me in the same hour what I shall speak. If I am
          called to preach, I will preach, and nobody shall stop me; for the
          Lord will be with my mouth. But, you see, until the man is conscious
          of his own weakness, he will run without being sent; and there is
          nobody so weak as that man. No one so weak as the man who has no
          commission from God, and no promise of help from him. Such a man will
          be thinking of this, and thinking of that, and running for this, that,
          and the other, because he has a lot of waste energy which he wants to
          use somewhere or somehow. Could we once see him consciously weak we
          should hear him say, |Here am I, send me!| in answer to the question,
          |Whom shall I send?| Then he would not go a warfare at his own
          charges, but he would draw upon the all-sufficiency of God, and find
          himself equal to every emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man who is consciously weak is strong, next, because of the holy
          caution that he will be sure to use. He will be on his guard, because
          he does not feel able to cope with adversaries. He will ask for a
          convoy for his little barque, for he is aware of pirates. If this weak
          man has to pass through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, depend upon
          it he will carry in his hand the weapon of All-prayer, like a drawn
          sword. The man that has strength goes hurrying on over hedge and
          ditch, and soon comes into mischief; but the consciously weak pilgrim
          keeps to the high-road, and travels carefully; and hence he is strong.
          Fear is a notably good housekeeper: she may not keep a luxurious
          table, but she always locks the doors at night, and takes care of all
          under her charge. Holy caution begets prudence; and prudence, by
          fostering vigour, and crying for heavenly aid, becomes strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, when a man is weak, then is he strong, because he is sure to
          pray, and prayer is power. The man who laments his weakness is sure to
          cry to the strong for strength. The more his weakness presses on him,
          the more he will pray. While he can do without his God he will do
          without his God; but when his own weakness becomes utter and entire,
          and he is ready to perish, then he turns unto his Lord, and is made
          strong. The utterly weak cry out unto God as nobody else does. He is
          too weak to play at praying: he groans, he sighs, he weeps. In his
          abject weakness he prevails, as Jacob did. He wrestled all night; but
          now at last the angel has touched the hollow of his thigh, and made
          his sinew shrink, and he cannot wrestle any longer. What will he do
          now? He falls; and as he falls he grasps his antagonist, and holds him
          fast, crying, |I will not let thee go except thou bless me.| As much
          to say, |I cannot wrestle with thee, I cannot try another fall; but I
          can and will hold thee fast. The dead weight of my weakness makes me
          hold thee as an anchor holds a ship. I will not let thee go except
          thou bless me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The weaker a man is in himself the stronger he is in prayer, if he
          makes use of his weakness as an appealing argument -- |Lord, if I were
          strong, thou mightest leave me. Do not leave me, for I am weakness
          itself. I am the feeblest child in all thy family, leave me not,
          neither forsake me. If thou leavest any, leave not thy poor dying
          infant, that can hardly wail out its griefs.| Weakness, as a plea with
          God in prayer, becomes a source of strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are weak we are strong, again, because then we are driven away
          from self to God. All strength is in God, and it is well to come to
          the one solitary storehouse and source of might. There is no power
          apart from God. As long as you and I look to the creature, we are
          looking to a cracked, broken cistern, that holds no water; but when we
          know that it is broken, and that there is not a drop of water in it,
          then we hasten to the great fountain and well-head. While we rest in
          any measure upon self, or the creature, we are standing with one foot
          on the sand; but when we get the right away from human nature because
          we are too weak to have the least reliance upon self whatever, then we
          have both feet on the rock, and this is safe standing. If thou
          believest in the living God, and if all thine own existence is by
          believing, thou livest at a mighty rate. But if thou believest in God
          in a measure, and if, at the same time, thou trustest thyself in a
          measure, thou art living at a dying rate, and half the joy which is
          possible to thee is lost. Thou are taking in bread with one hand, and
          poison with the other: thou art feeding thy soul with substance and
          with shadow, and that makes a sorry mixture. When the shadow is clean
          taken away, and thou hast nothing but the substance, then art thou a
          strong man, fed upon substantial meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last of all, dear friends, I believe that, when a man is weak, he
          becomes strong to a large extent, because his weakness compels him to
          concentrate all his faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sense of weakness brings out all the forces of a resolute spirit,
          and leads him to call in all the energy within his reach. When I have
          preached to you in extreme weakness, as I have often done, when I have
          afterwards read the sermon, I have been much more satisfied with it
          than I have been with others in which I felt more pleasure at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          God helps us most when we most need his help; and, besides that, the
          man himself is, by his weakness, forced to use himself right up. When
          a man feels himself to be rather a large vessel, he puts in the tap
          somewhere near the top, and only a small supply flows out to the
          people; but when he is, in his own feelings, like a poor little cask
          with only a small supply in it, he puts the tap right down at the
          bottom, and permits all that is in the barrel to flow forth. Many a
          poor, weak brother, who says all the little that he knows, give forth
          more instruction than the learned divine who only favours his people
          with a small portion of his vast stores. When a man, in serving God,
          spends himself to the last farthing, he will often far more enrich his
          hearers than the man of ten talents who uses his resources with a
          prudent parsimony. Dear brother, it will often be a good thing for you
          to feel, |Now, God helping me, I must do my very utmost at this time.
          I have so little ability that every faculty within me must be wide
          awake, and serve God at its best.| Thus your weakness will arouse you,
          and set you on fire, and, by the blessing of God, it will be the means
          of gaining you strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very well, then, let us pick up our tools and go to our work
          rejoicing, feeling -- Well, I may be weaker, or I may be stronger in
          myself, but my strength is in my God. If I should ever become
          stronger, then I must pray for a deeper sense of weakness, lest I
          become weak through my strength. And if I should ever become weaker
          than I am, then I must hope and believe that I am really becoming
          stronger in the Lord. Whether I am weak or strong, what matters it? He
          who never fails and never changes will perfect his strength in my
          weakness, and this is glory to me. Amen.<br />
