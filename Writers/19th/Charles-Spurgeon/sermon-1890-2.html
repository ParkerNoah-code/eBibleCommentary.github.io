        <p>To All the Bishops of Sicily.</p>
        <p>
          Of the final decision of the trials of bishops, and graver
          ecclesiastical cases in the seat of the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zephyrinus, archbishop of the city of Rome, to all the bishops settled
          in Sicily, in the Lord, greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ought to be mindful of the grace of God to us, which in His own
          merciful regard has raised us for this purpose to the summit of
          priestly honour, that, abiding by His commandments, and appointed in a
          certain supervision of His priests, we may prohibit things unlawful,
          and teach those that are to be followed. As night does not extinguish
          the stars of heaven, so the unrighteousness of the world does not
          blind the minds of the faithful that hold by the sure support of
          Scripture. Therefore we ought to consider well and attend carefully to
          the Scriptures, and the divine precepts which are contained in these
          Scriptures, in order that we may show ourselves not transgressors, but
          fulfillers of the law of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now patriarchs and primates, in investigating the case of an accused
          bishop, should not pronounce a final decision until, supported by the
          authority of the apostles, they find that the person either confesses
          himself guilty, or is proved so by witnesses trustworthy and regularly
          examined, who should not be fewer in number than were those disciples
          whom the Lord directed to be chosen for the help of the apostles --
          that is, seventy-two. Detractors also, who are to be rooted out by
          divine authority, and the advisers of enemies (auctores inimicorum),
          we do not admit in the indictment of bishops or in evidence against
          them; nor should any one of superior rank be indicted or condemned on
          the accusations of inferiors. Nor in a doubtful case should a decisive
          judgment be pronounced; nor should any trial be held valid unless it
          has been conducted according to order. No one, moreover, should be
          judged in his absence, because both divine and human laws forbid that.
          The accusers of those persons should also be free of all suspicion,
          because the Lord has chosen that His pillars should stand firm, and
          not be shaken by any one who will. For a sentence should not bind any
          of them if it is not given by their proper judge, because even the
          laws of the world ordain that that be done. For any accused bishop
          may, if it be necessary, choose twelve judges by whom his case may be
          justly judged. Nor should he be heard or excommunicated or judged
          until these be chosen by him; and on his being regularly summoned at
          first to a council of his own bishops, his case should be justly heard
          by them, and investigated on sound principles. The end of his case,
          however, should be remitted to the seat of the apostles, that it may
          be finally decided there. Nor should it be finished, as has been
          decreed of old by the apostles or their successors, until it is
          sustained by its authority. To it also all, and especially the
          oppressed, should appeal and have recourse as to a mother, that they
          may be nourished by her breasts, defended by her authority, and
          relieved of their oppressions, because |a mother cannot,| and should
          not, |forget her son.| For the trials of bishops and graver
          ecclesiastical cases, as the apostles and their holy successors have
          decreed, are to be finally decided along with other bishops by the
          seat of the apostles, and by no other; because, although they may be
          transferred to other bishops, it was yet to the blessed Apostle Peter
          these terms were addressed: |Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall
          be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
          loosed in heaven.| And the other privileges which have been granted to
          this holy seat alone are found embodied both in the constitutions of
          the apostles and their successors, and in very many others in harmony
          with these. For the apostles have prefixed seventy decrees, together
          with very many other bishops, and have appointed them to be kept. For
          to judge rashly of the secrets of another's heart is sin; and it is
          unjust to reprove him on suspicion whose works seem not other than
          good, since God alone is Judge of those things which are unknown to
          men. He, however, |knoweth the secrets of the heart,| and not another.
          For unjust judgments are to be guarded against by all, especially
          however by the servants of God. |And the servant of the Lord must not
          strive,| nor harm any one. For bishops are to be borne by laity and
          clergy, and masters by servants, in order that, under the exercise of
          endurance, things temporal may be maintained, and things eternal hoped
          for. For that increases the worth of virtue, which does not violate
          the purpose of religion. You should be earnestly intent that none of
          your brothers be grievously injured or undone. Therefore you ought to
          succour the oppressed, and deliver them from the hand of their
          persecutors, in order that with the blessed Job you may say: |The
          blessing of him that was ready to perish will come upon me, and I
          consoled the widow's heart. I put on righteousness, and clothed myself
          with a robe and a diadem, my judgment. I was eye to the blind, and
          foot to the lame. I was a father to the poor, and the cause which I
          knew not I searched out most carefully. I brake the grinders of the
          wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth;| and so forth. You,
          therefore, who have been placed in eminence by God, ought with all
          your power to check and repel those who prepare snares for brethren,
          or raise seditions and offences against them. For it is easy by word
          to deceive man, not however God. Therefore you ought to keep these
          off, and be on your guard against them, until such darkness is done
          away utterly, and the morning star shines upon them, and gladness
          arises, most holy brethren. Given on the 20th September, in the
          consulship of the most illustrious Saturninus and Gallicanus.
