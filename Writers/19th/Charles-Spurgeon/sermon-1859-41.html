        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.265)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 31st, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
          lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
          easy, and my burden is light.| -- Matthew 11:28-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE single sentence which I have selected for my text consists of
          these words: -- |I am meek and lowly in heart.| These words might be
          taken to have three distinct bearings upon the context. They may be
          regarded as being the lesson to be taught: |Learn of me; for I am meek
          and lowly in heart.| One great lesson of the gospel is to teach us to
          be meek -- to put away our high and angry spirits, and to make us
          lowly in heart. Peradventure, this is the meaning of the passage --
          that it we will but come to Christ's school, he will teach us the
          hardest of all lessons, -- how to be meek and lowly in heart. Again;
          other expositors might consider this sentence to signify, that is the
          only Spirit in which a man can learn of Jesus, -- the Spirit which is
          necessary if we would become Christ's scholars. We can learn nothing,
          even of Christ himself, while we hold our heads up with pride, or
          exalt ourselves with self-confidence. We must be meek and lowly in
          heart, otherwise we are totally unfit to be taught by Christ. Empty
          vessels may be filled; but vessels that are full already can receive
          no more. The man who knows his own emptiness can receive abundance of
          knowledge, and wisdom, and grace, from Christ; but he who glories in
          himself is not in a fit condition to receive anything from God. I have
          no doubt that both of these interpretations are true, and might be
          borne out by the connection. It is the lesson of Christ's school -- it
          is the spirit of Christ's disciples. But I choose, rather, this
          morning, to regard these words as being a commendation of the Teacher
          himself. |Come unto me and learn; for I am meek and lowly in heart.|
          As much as to say, |I can teach, and you will not find it hard to
          learn of me.| In fact, the subject of this morning's discourse is
          briefly this: the gentle, lovely character of Christ should be a high
          and powerful inducement to sinners to come to Christ. I intend so to
          use it: first of all, noticing the two qualities which Christ here
          claims for himself. He is |meek;| and then he is |lowly in heart;| and
          after we have observed these two things, I shall come to push the
          conclusion home. Come unto him, all ye that are labouring and are
          heavy laden; come unto him, and take his yoke upon you; for he is meek
          and lowly in heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, I am to consider THE FIRST QUALITY WHICH JESUS CHRIST
          CLAIMS. He declares that he is |MEEK.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is no egotist; he takes no praise to himself. If ever he utters
          a word in self-commendation, it is not with that object; it is with
          another design, namely that he may entice souls to come to him. Here,
          in order to exhibit this meekness, I shall have to speak of him in
          several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, Christ is meek, as opposed to the ferocity of spirit
          manifested by zealots and bigots. Take, for a prominent example of the
          opposite of meekness, the false prophet Mahomet. The strength of his
          cause lies in the fact, that he is not meek. He presents himself
          before those whom he claims as disciples, and says, |Take my yoke upon
          you, and learn of me, for I am neither meek, nor lowly in heart; I
          will have no patience with you; there is my creed, or there is the
          scimitar -- death or conversion, whichever you please.| The moment the
          Ma- hometan religion withdrew that very forcible argument of
          decapitation or impalement, it stayed in its work of conversion, and
          never progressed; for the very strength of the false prophet lays in
          the absence of any meekness. How opposite this is to Christ! Although
          he hath a right to demand man's love and man's faith, yet he comes not
          into the world to demand it with fire and sword. His might is under
          persuasion; his strength is quiet forbearance, and patient endurance;
          his mightiest force is the sweet attraction of compassion and love. He
          knoweth nothing of the ferocious hosts of Mahomet; he bids none of us
          draw our sword to propagate the faith, but saith, |Put up thy sword
          into its scabbard; they that take the sword shall perish by the
          sword.| |My kingdom is not of this world, else might my servants
          fight.| Nay, Mahomet is not the only instance we can bring; but even
          good men are subject to the like mistakes. They imagine that religion
          is to be spread by terror and thunder. Look at John himself, the most
          lovely of all the disciples: he would call fire from heaven on a
          village of Samaritans, because they rejected Christ. Hark to his hot
          enquiry, -- |Wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven
          and consume them?| Christ's disciples were to him something like the
          sons of Zeruiah to David; or when Shimei mocked David, the sons of
          Zeruiah said, |Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me
          go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.| But David meekly said,
          |What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? | -- and put them
          aside. He had something of the spirit of his Master; he knew that his
          honour was not then to be defended by sword or spear. O blessed Jesus!
          thou hast no fury in thy spirit; when men rejected thee thou didst not
          draw the sword to smite, but, on the contrary, thou didst yield thine
          eyes to weeping. Behold your Saviour, disciples, and see whether he
          was not meek. He had long preached in Jerusalem without effect, and at
          last he knew that they were ready to put him to death; but what saith
          he, as, standing on the top of the hill, he beheld the city that had
          rejected his gospel? Did he invoke a curse upon it? Did he suffer one
          word of anger to leap from his burning heart? Ah! no; there were
          flames, but they were those of love; there were scalding drops, but
          they were those of grief. He beheld the city, and wept over it, and
          said, |O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy
          children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
          and ye would not.| And for a further proof of the absence of all
          uncharitableness, observe that, even when they drove the nails into
          his blessed hands, yet he had no curse to breathe upon them, but his
          dying exclamation was, |Father, forgive them, for they know not what
          they do.| O sinners! see what a Christ it is that we bid you serve. No
          angry bigot, no fierce warrior, claiming your unwilling faith: he is a
          tender Jesus. Your rejection of him has made his bowels yearn over
          you; and though you abhor his gospel, he has pleaded for you, saying,
          |Let him alone yet another year, till I dig about him; peradventure he
          may yet bring forth fruit.| What a patient master is he! Oh! will you
          not serve him!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But the idea is not brought out fully, unless we take another
          sense. There is a sternness which cannot be condemned. A Christian man
          will often feel him self called to bear most solemn and stern witness
          against the error of his times, But Christ's mission, although it
          certainly did testify against the sin of his times, yet had a far
          greater reference to the salvation of the souls of men. To show the
          idea that I have in my own mind, which I have not yet brought out, I
          must picture Elijah. What a man was he! His mission was to be the bold
          unflinching advocate of the right, and to bear a constant testimony
          against the wickedness of his age. And how boldly did he speak! Look
          at him: how grand the picture! Can you not conceive him on that
          memorable day, when he met Ahab, and Ahab said, |Hast thou found me, O
          mine enemy?| Do you mark that mighty answer which Elijah gave him,
          while the king trembles at his words. Or, better still, can you
          picture the scene when Elijah said, |Take you two bullocks, ye
          priests, and build an altar, and see this day, whether God be God or
          Baal be God.| Do you see him as he mocks the worshippers of Baal, and
          with a biting irony says to them, |Cry aloud, for he is a god.| And do
          you see him in the last grand scene, when the fire has come down from
          heaven, and consumed the sacrifice, and licked up the water, and
          burned the altar? Do you hear him cry, |Take the prophets of Baal; let
          not one escape?| Can you see him in his might hewing them in pieces by
          the brook, and making their flesh a feast for the fowls of heaven?
          Now, you cannot picture Christ in the same position He had the stern
          qualities of Elijah, but he kept them, as it were, behind, hike
          sleeping thunder, that must not as yet waken and lift up its voice.
          There were some rumblings of time tempest, it is true, when he spoke
          so sternly to the Sadducees, and Scribes, and Pharisees; those woes
          were like murmurings of a distant storm, but it was a distant storm;
          whereas, Elijah lived in the midst of the whirlwind itself, and was no
          still small voice, but was as the very fire of God, and hike the
          chariot in which he mounted to heaven -- fit chariot for such a fiery
          man! Christ here stands in marked contrast. Picture him in somewhat a
          like position to Elijah with Ahab. There is Jesus left alone with an
          adulterus woman. She has been taken in the very fact. Her accusers are
          present, ready to bear witness against her. By a simple sentence he
          emptied the room of every witness; convicted by their conscience they
          all retire. And now what does Christ say? The woman might have lifted
          her eyes, and have looked at him, and said, |Hast thou found me O mine
          enemy? | -- for she might have regarded Christ as the enemy of so base
          a sin as that which she had committed against her marriage bed. But
          instead thereof Jesus said, |Doth no man condemn thee? Neither do I
          condemn thee; go and sin no more.| Oh, how different from the
          sternness or Elijah! Sinners! if I had to preach Elijah as your
          Saviour I should feel that I had a hard task, for you might throw it
          in my teeth -- |Shall we come to Elijah? He will call fire from heaven
          on us, as he did upon the captains and their fifties. Shall we come to
          Elijah? Surely he will slay us, for we have been like the prophets of
          Baal?| Nay, sinners; but I bid you come to Christ. Come to him, who,
          although he hated sin more than Elijah could do, yet nevertheless,
          loved the sinner -- who, though he would not share iniquity, yet
          spares the transgressors, and has no words but those of love and
          mercy, and peace and comfort, for those of you who will now come and
          put your trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must put in a word here by way of caveat. I am very far from
          imputing, for a single moment, any blame to Elijah. He was quite
          right. None but Elijah could have fulfilled the mission which his
          Master gave him. He needed to be all he was, and certainly not less
          stern; but Elijah was not sent to be a Saviour; he was quite unfit for
          that. He was sent to administer a stern rebuke. He was God's iron
          tongue of threatening, not God's silver tongue of mercy. Now, Jesus is
          the silver tongue of grace. Sinners! hear the sweet bells ringing, as
          Jesus now invites you to come unto him. |Come unto me, all ye that are
          weary and heavy laden;' for I am not stern, I am not harsh, I am no
          fire- killing Elijah; I am the meek, tender, lowly-hearted Jesus.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ is meek in heart. To exhibit this quality in another light,
          call to your minds Moses. Moses was the meekest of men; and yet Christ
          far excels Moses in his meekness. Around Moses there seems to be a
          hedge, a ring of fire. The character of Moses is like Mount Sinai; it
          hath bounds set about it, so that one cannot draw near unto him. Moses
          was not an approachable person, he was quiet and meek, and tender, but
          there was a sacred majesty about the King in Jeshurun that hedged his
          path, so that we cannot imagine the people making themselves familiar
          with him. Whoever read of Moses sitting down upon a well, and talking
          to a harlot like the woman of Samaria? Whoever heard a story of a
          Magdalene washing the feet of Moses? Can ye conceive Moses eating
          bread with a sinner, or passing under a sycamore tree, and calling
          Zaccheus, the thievish publican, and bidding him come down? There is a
          kind of stately majesty in Moses, no mere affectation of standing
          alone, but a loneliness of superior worth. Men looked up to him as to
          some cloud-capped mountain, and despaired of being able to enter into
          the lofty circle, within which they might have communed with him.
          Moses always had in spirit what he once had in visible token; he had a
          glory about his brow, and before he could converse with men he must
          wear a veil, for they could not bear to look upon the face of Moses.
          But how different is Jesus! He is a man among men; wherever he goes no
          one is afraid to speak to him. You scarcely meet with any one who
          dares not approach him. There is a poor woman, it is true, who hath
          the flux, and she fears to come near him, because she is ceremonially
          unclean; but even she can come behind him in the press, and touch the
          hem of his garment, and virtue goeth Out of him. Nobody was afraid of
          Jesus. The mothers brought their little babes to him: whoever heard of
          their doing that to Moses? Did ever babe get a blessing of Moses? But
          Jesus was all meekness -- the approachable man, feasting with the
          wedding guests, sitting down with sinners, conversing with the unholy
          and the unclean, touching the leper, and making himself at home with
          all men. Sinners! this is the one we invite you to -- this homely man,
          Christ. Not to Moses, for you might say, |He hath horns of light, and
          how shall I draw near to his majesty ! He is bright perfection -- the
          very lightnings of Sinai rest upon his brow.| But sinners, ye cannot
          say that of Christ. He is as holy as Moses -- as great, and far
          greater, but he is still so homely that ye may come to him. Little
          children, ye may put your trust in him. Ye may say your little prayer,
        </p>
        <p>|Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,</p>
        <p>Look on me, a little Child;</p>
        <p>Pity my simplicity,</p>
        <p>Suffer me to come to thee.|</p>
        <p>
          He will not cast you away, or think you have intruded on him. Ye
          harlots, ye drunkards, ye feasters, ye wedding guests, ye may all
          come; |This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.| He is |meek
          and lowly in heart.| That gives, I think, a still fuller and broader
          sense to the term, |meek.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But yet, to push the term a little further. Christ on earth was a
          king; but there as nothing about him of the exclusive pomp of kings,
          which excludes the common people from their society. Look at the
          Eastern king Ahasuerus, sitting on his throne. He is considered by his
          people as a superior being. None may come in unto the king, unless he
          is called for. Should he venture to pass the circle, the guards will
          slay him, unless the king stretches out the golden sceptre. Even
          Esther, his beloved wife, is afraid to draw near, and must put her
          life in her hand, if she comes into the presence of the king uncalled.
          Christ is a king; but where his pomp? Where the Janitor that keeps his
          door, and thrusts away the poor? Where the soldiers that ride on
          either side of his chariot to screen the monarch from the gaze of
          poverty? See thy King, O Sion! He comes, he comes in royal pomp!
          Behold, Judah, behold thy King cometh! But how cometh he? |Meek and
          lowly, riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.| And
          who are his attendants? See, the young children, boys and girls! They
          cry, |Hosannah! Hosannah! Hosannah!| And who are they that wait upon
          him? His poor disciples. They pull the branches from the trees; they
          cast their garments in the street, and there he rideth on -- Judah's
          royal King. His courtiers are the poor; his pomp is that tribute which
          grateful hearts delight to offer. O sinners, will you not come to
          Christ? There is nothing in him to keep you back. You need not say,
          like Esther did of old,| I will go in unto the king, if I perish I
          perish. Come, and welcome! Come, and welcome! Christ is more ready to
          receive you than you are to come to him. Come to the King! |What is
          thy petition, and what is thy request? It shall be done unto thee.| If
          thou stayest away, it is not because he shuts the door, it is because
          thou wilt not come. Come, filthy, naked, ragged, poor, lost, ruined,
          come, just as thou art. Here he stands, like a fountain freely opened
          for all comers. |Whosoever will, let him come and take of the waters
          of life freely.|
        </p>
        <p>
          5. I will give you but one more picture to set forth the meekness of
          Christ, and I think I shall not have completed the story without it.
          The absence of all selfishness from the character of Christ, makes one
          ingredient of this precious quality of his meekness. You remember the
          history of Jonah. Jonah is sent to prophecy against Nineveh; but he is
          selfish. He will not go for he shall get no honour by it. He does not
          want to go so long a journey for so small a price. He will not go. He
          will take a ship and go to Tarshish. He is thrown out into the sea,
          swallowed by a fish, and vomited by it upon dry land. He goes away to
          Nineveh, and not wanting courage, he goes through its streets, crying,
          |Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.| That one man's
          earnest cry moves the city from one end to the other. The king
          proclaims a first; the people mourn in sackcloth and confess their
          sins. God sends them tidings of mercy, and they are spared. But what
          will Jonah do? Oh, tell it not, ye heavens; let none hear it -- that
          ever a prophet of God could do the like! He sits himself down, and he
          is angry with God. And why his anger? Because, says he, |God has not
          destroyed that city.| If God had destroyed the city he would have
          shouted over the ruins, because his reputation would have been safe;
          but now that the city is saved, and his own reputation for a prophet
          tarnished, he must needs sit down in anger. But Christ is the very
          reverse of this. Sinners! Christ does thunder at you sometimes, but it
          is always that he may bring you to repentance. He does take Jonah's
          cry, and utter it far more mightily than Jonah could; he does warn you
          that there is a fire that never can be quenched, and a worm that dieth
          not; but if you turn to him, will he sit down and be angry? Oh! no;
          methinks I see him. There you come poor prodigals; your father falls
          upon your neck and kisses you, and you are accepted, and a feast is
          made. Here comes the elder brother, Jesus. What does he say? Is he
          angry because you are saved? Ah! no! |My Father,| saith he, |my
          younger brother have all come home, and I love them; they shall share
          my honours; they shall sit upon my throne; they shall share my
          heaven.| |Where I am, there they shall be also.| I will take them into
          union with myself, and as they have wasted their inheritance, all that
          I have shall be their's for ever. Oh! come home, prodigal, there is no
          angry brother and no angry father. Come back, come back, my brother,
          my wandering brother, I invite thee; for Jesus is rejoiced to receive
          thee. Do you not see, then, that the meekness of Christ is a sweet and
          blessed reason why we should come to him?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second virtue which Christ claims for himself, is LOWLINESS OF
          HEART.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I looked this passage out in the original, I half wondered how it
          was that Christ found such a sweet word for the expression of his
          meaning; for the Greeks, do not know much about humility, and they
          have not a very good word to set forth this idea of lowliness of
          heart. I find that if this passage stood in another connection, the
          word might even be interpreted |degraded, debased,| for the Greeks
          thought that if a man was humble, he degraded himself -- that if he
          stooped, he debased himself right out. |Well,| says Christ, |if you
          think so, so be it, and he takes the word. The word means, |near the
          ground.| So is Christ's heart. We cannot be so low that he will not
          stoop to reach us. I would just set out the lowliness of Christ's
          heart in this way. Christ is |lowly in heart;| that is, he is willing
          to receive the poorest sinner in the world. The pharisee thought that
          the keeper of the gate of heaven would admit only the rich, and not
          the poor. Mark Christ's teaching. There were two came to the gate once
          upon a time; one was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared
          sumptuously every day; he knocked, and thought that full sure he must
          enter; but |in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments.| There came
          another, borne on angel's wings. It was a beggar, whose many sores the
          dogs had licked and he had not so much as to knock at the gate, for
          the angel's carried him straight away into the very centre of
          paradise, and laid him in Abraham's bosom. Jesus Christ is willing to
          receive beggars into his bosom. Kings, you know, condescend, when they
          permit even the rich to be presented to them, and the kissing of a
          monarch's hand is something very wonderful indeed, but to have the
          kisses of his lips who is the King of kings, is no uncommon thing for
          men that are shivering in rags, or that are sick upon miserable beds,
          in dingy attics. Christ is |lowly in heart;| he goes with what men
          call the vulgar herd; he hath nothing of affected royalty about him --
          he hath a nobler royalty than that, the royalty that is too proud to
          think anything of a stoop, that can only measure itself by its own
          intrinsic excellence, and not by its official standing. He receiveth
          the lowest, the meanest, the vilest, for he is |lowly in heart.| If I
          have among my congregation some of the poorest of the poor, let them
          come away to Christ, and let them not imagine that their poverty need
          keep them back. I am always delighted when I see a number of women
          here from the neighbouring workhouse. I bless God that there are some
          in the workhouse that are willing to come; and though they have
          sometimes been put to a little inconvenience by so doing, yet I have
          known them sooner give up their dinner than give up coming to hear the
          Word. God bless the workhouse women, and may they be led to Christ,
          for be is meek and lowly in heart, and will not reject them. I must
          confess also, I like to see a smock frock here and there in the midst
          of the congregation. Oh! what a mercy, that in the palace of the Great
          King there shall be found these workmen, these blouses, They shall be
          made partakers of the kingdom of God. He makes no difference between
          prince and pauper; he takes men to heaven just as readily from the
          workhouse, as from the palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, this lowliness of heart in Christ leads him to receive the
          most ignorant as well as the learned to himself. I know that sometimes
          poor ignorant people get a notion in their heads that they cannot be
          saved, because they cannot read and do not know much. I have
          sometimes, especially in country villages, received this answer, when
          I have been asking anything about personal religion. |Well, you know,
          sir, I never had any learning.| Oh! but, ye unlearned, is this a
          reason why ye should stay away from him who is lowly in heart? It was
          said of an old Greek philosopher, that he wrote over his door, |None
          but the learned may enter here.| But Christ, on the contrary, writes
          over his door, |He that is simple let him turn in hither.| There are
          many great men with long handles to their names who know little of the
          gospel, while some of the poor unlettered ones spell out the whole
          secret, and become perfect masters in divinity. If they had degrees
          who deserve them, diplomas should often be transferred, and given to
          those who hold the plough handle or work at the carpenter's bench; for
          there is often more divinity in the little finger of a ploughman than
          there is in the whole body of some of our modern divines. |Don't they
          understand divinity?| you say. Yes, in the letter of it; but as to the
          spirit and life of it, D.D. often means DOUBLY DESTITUTE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lowliness of Christ may be clearly seen in yet another point of
          view. He is not only willing to receive the poor, and to receive the
          ignorant, but he is also ever ready to receive men, despite the
          vileness of their characters. Some teachers can stoop, and freely too,
          to both poor and ignorant; but they cannot stoop to the wicked. I
          think we have all felt a difficulty here. |However poor a man may be,
          or however little he knows,| you say, |I don't mind talking with him,
          and trying to do him good; but I cannot talk with a man who is a rogue
          or a vagabond, or with a woman who has lost her character.| I know you
          cannot; there are a great many things Christ did which we cannot do.
          We, who are the servants of Christ, have attempted to draw a line
          where duty has its bound. Like the domestic servant in some lordly
          mansion who stoops not to menial employment. We are above our work. We
          are so fastidious, that we cannot go after the chief of sinners, and
          the vilest of the vile. Not so, Christ. |He receiveth sinners and
          eateth with them.| He, in the days of his flesh, became familiar with
          the outcasts. He sought them out that he might save them; he entered
          their homes; he found his way into the slums. like some diligent
          officer of the police, he was willing to lodge where they lodged, eat
          at their table, and associate with their class to find them out. His
          mission was to seek as well as to save. Oh, see him stand, with arms
          wide open! Will that thief, who is justly executed for his crimes, be
          recognized by him? Yes, he will. There, with his arms outstretched, he
          hangs; the thief flies as it were to his bosom, and Jesus gives him a
          most blessed embrace. |To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.|
          Christ has received the thief with open heart and open arms too. And
          there is Mary. Do you see her? She is washing the feet of Jesus. Why,
          she is a bad character, one of the worst women on the town. What will
          Christ say? Say? Why, hear how he speaks to Simon, the pious,
          reputable Pharisee. Saith he, after putting the parable concerning the
          two debtors, |which of them shall love him most?| -- and then he
          explains that this woman hath had much forgiven, and therefore she
          loves him much. |Thy sins, which are many, are all forgiven,| saith
          he, and she goes her way in peace. There are many men you and I would
          not demean ourselves to notice, that Christ will take to heaven at
          last; for he is |lowly in heart.| He takes the base, the vilest, the
          scum, the offscouring, the filth, the garbage of the world, and out of
          such stuff and matter as that, he buildeth up a holy temple, and
          gathereth to himself trophies for his honour and praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, while I speak of the lowliness of Christ's heart, I must
          remark another thing. Perhaps one is saying here, |Oh! sir, it is not
          what I have been, as to my conduct, that keeps me back from Christ;
          but I feel that what I am as to my nature restrains me; I am such a
          dolt, I shall never learn in his school I am such a hard-hearted one,
          he will never melt me, and if he does save me, I shall never be worth
          his having. Yes, but Christ is |lowly in heart.| There are some great
          goldsmiths that of course can only think of preparing and polishing
          the choicest diamonds; but Jesus Christ polishes a common pebble, and
          makes a jewel of it. Goldmsiths make their precious treasures out of
          precious materials; Christ makes his precious things out of dross. He
          begins always with bad material. The palace of our king is not made of
          cedar wood, as Solomon's, or if it be made of wood, certainly he has
          chosen the knottiest trees and the knottiest planks wherewith to build
          his habitation. He has taken those to he his scholars who were the
          greatest dunces; so amazing is the lowliness of Christ's heart. He
          sits down on the form with us to teach us the A,B,C, of repentance,
          and if we are slow to learn it he begins again, and takes us through
          our alphabet, and if we forget it he will often teach us our letters
          over again; for though he is able to teach the angels, yet he
          condescends to instruct babes, and as we go step by step in heavenly
          literature, Christ is not above teaching the elements. He teaches not
          only in the University, and the Grammar-school, where high attainments
          are valued, but he teaches in the day-school, where the elements and
          first principles are to be instilled. It is he who teaches the sinner,
          what sinner means in deep conviction, and what faith means in holy
          assurance. It is not only he who takes us to Pisgah, and bids us view
          the promised land, but it is he also who takes us to Calvary, and
          makes us learn that simplest of all things, the sacred writing of the
          cross. He, if I may use such a phrase, will not only teach us how to
          write them highly ornamental writing of the Eden Paradise, the richly
          gilded, illuminated letters of communion and fellowship, but he
          teaches us how to make the pot-hooks amid hangers of repentance and
          faith. he begins at the beginning; for he is |meek and lowly in
          heart.| Come, then, ye dolts, ye fools; come ye sinners, ye vile ones;
          come, ye dullest of all scholars, ye poor, ye illiterate, ye who are
          rejected and despised of men; come to him who was rejected and
          despised as well as you. Come and welcome! Christ bids you come!
        </p>
        <p>|Let not conscience make you linger;</p>
        <p>Nor of fitness fondly dream;</p>
        <p>All the fitness he requireth,</p>
        <p>Is to feel your need of him:</p>
        <p>This he gives you;</p>
        <p>'Tis his Spirit's rising beam.</p>
        <p>
          Come, poor sinners! come to a gentle Saviour! and you shall never
          regret that you came to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Having thus spoken on the two marks of our Lord's character, I
          propose to conclude, if God shall help me, by knocking home the nail,
          by driving in the wedge, and pressing upon you a conclusion from these
          arguments. The conclusion of the whole matter is this, since Christ is
          |meek and lowly in heart,| sinners come to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come to him, then, first, whoever you may be, for he is |meek and
          lowly in heart.| When a man has done anything wrong, and wants a help
          through his difficulty, if about to employ some counsel to plead for
          him in a court of law, he might say, |Oh! don't engage Mr. So-and-so
          for me; I hear he is a very hard-hearted man; I should not like to
          tell him what I have done, and entrust my case in his hands. Send for
          Mr. So-and-so; I have heard that he is very kind and gentle; let him
          come and hear my case, and let him conduct the pleadings for me:|
          Sinner! you are sinful, but Christ is very tender-hearted. Speed thy
          way to Christ's private chamber, -- your own closet of prayer. Tell
          him all you have done; he will not upbraid you: confess all your sins;
          he will not chide you. Tell him all your follies; he will not be angry
          with you. Commit your case to him, and with a sweet smile he will say,
          |I have cast thy sins behind my back; thou hast come to reason with
          me; I will discover to thee a matter of faith which excels all reason,
          -- | Though thy sins be as scarlet, they shall be as wool; though they
          be red like crimson, they shall be whiter than snow Come to Christ,
          then, sinful ones, because he is |meek and lowly in heart,| and he can
          bear with the narrative of your offences. |But, sir, I am very timid,
          and I dare not go.| Ah, but however timid you may be, you need not be
          afraid of him. He knows your timidity, and he will meet you with a
          smile, and say, |Fear not. Be of good cheer. Tell me thy sin, put thy
          trust in me, and thou shalt even yet rejoice to know my power to save.
          Come now,| saith he, |come to me at once. Linger no longer. I do not
          strive nor cry, nor cause my voice to be hearth in the streets. A
          bruised reed I will not break, the smoking flax I will not quench; but
          I will bring forth judgment unto victory.| Come then, ye timid ones to
          Christ for he is meek and lowly in heart. |Oh,| says one, |but I am
          despairing; I have been so long under a sense of sin, I cannot go to
          Christ.| Poor soul! he is so meek and lowly, that, despairing though
          thou mayest be, take courage now; though it be like a forlorn hope to
          thee, yet go to him. Say, in the words of the hymn --
        </p>
        <p>|I' ll to the gracious King approach,</p>
        <p>Whose sceptre pardon gives;</p>
        <p>Perhaps he may command my touch,</p>
        <p>And then the suppliant lives.</p>
        <p>I can but perish if I go;</p>
        <p>I am resolved to try;</p>
        <p>For if I stay away, I know</p>
        <p>I must for ever die.|</p>
        <p>And you may add this comfortable reflection --</p>
        <p>|But if I die with mercy sought,</p>
        <p>When I the King have tried,</p>
        <p>This were to die (delightful thought!)</p>
        <p>As sinner never died.|</p>
        <p>
          Come to him, then, timid and despairing; for he is |meek and lowly in
          heart.| First, he bids thee confess. What a sweet confessor! Put thy
          lip to his ear, and tell him all. He is |meek and lowly in heart.|
          Fear not. None of thy sins can move him to anger. If thou dost but
          confess them. If thou keepest them in thy heart, they shall be like a
          slumbering volcano; and a furnace of destruction thou shalt find even
          to the uttermost by-and-bye. But confess thy sins; tell them all; he
          is meek and lowly in heart.| Happy confession! when we have such a
          confessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, he bids thee trust him; and canst thou not trust him? He is
          |meek and lowly in heart.| Sinner! put confidence in Christ. There
          never was such a tender heart as his, never such a compassionate face.
          Look him in the face, poor soul, as thou seest him dying on the tree,
          and say, is not that a face that any man might trust! Look at him!
          Canst thou doubt him? Wilt thou withhold thy cause from such a
          Redeemer as this? No, Jesus! thou art so generous, so good, so kind
          Take thou my cause in hand. Just as I am, I come to thee. Save me, I
          beseech thee, for I put my trust in thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then Jesus not only bids you confess and believe, but he bids you
          afterwards serve him. And sure, sinners, this should be a reason why
          you should do it. that he is so |meek and lowly in heart.| It is said,
          |Good masters make good servants.| What good servants you and I ought
          to be, for what a good Master we have! Never an ill word doth he say
          to us. If sometimes he pointeth out anything we have done amiss, it is
          only for our good. Not for his profit doth he chasten, but for ours.
          Sinner! I ask thee not to serve the god of this world -- that foul
          fiend who shall destroy thee after all thy service. The devil is thy
          master now, and ye have heard the wages he bestows. But come and serve
          Christ, the meek and lowly one, who will give thee good cheer while
          thou art serving him, and give thee a blessed reward when thy work is
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, best of all, sinners! come to Christ. Come to him in all his
          offices, for he is |meek and lowly in heart.| Sinner! thou art sick --
          Christ is a physician. If men have broken a bone, and they are about
          to have a surgeon fetched, they say, |Oh! is he a feeling tender
          hearted man?| For there is many an army surgeon that takes off a leg,
          and never thinks of the pain he is giving. |Is he a kind man?| says
          the poor sufferer, when he is about to be strapped down upon the
          table.| Ah! poor sufferer, Christ will heal thy broken bones, and he
          will do it with downy fingers. Never was there so light a touch as
          this heavenly surgeon has. |Tis pleasure even to he wounded by him,
          much more to be healed, Oh! what balm is that he gives to the poor
          bleeding heart! Fear not; there was never such a physician as this. If
          he give thee now and then a bitter pill and a sour draught, yet he
          will give thee such honied words and such sweet promises therewith,
          that thou shalt swallow it all up without murmuring. Nay, if he be
          with thee, thou canst even swallow up death in victory; and never know
          that thou hast died because victory hath taken the bitter taste away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinner! thou art not only sick, and therefore bidden to come to him,
          but thou art moreover in debt, and he offers now to pay thy debts, and
          to discharge them in full. Come, come to him, for he is not harsh.
          Some men, when they do mean to let a debtor off, first have him in
          their office, and give him as much as they can of the most severe
          rebukes; -- | You rogue, you! how dare you get in my debt, when you
          knew you could not pay? You have brought a deal of trouble on
          yourself, you have ruined your family,| and so forth; and the good man
          gives him some very sound admonition, and very right too; till at
          length he says, |I'll let you off this time; come, now, I forgive you,
          and I hope you will never do so again.| But Christ is even better than
          this. |There is all your debt,| he says, |I have nailed it to the
          cross; sinner, I forgive thee all,| and not one accusing word comes
          from his lips. Come, then, to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fear I have spoilt my master in the painting; something like the
          artist who had to depict some fair damsel, and he so misrepresented
          her features, that she lost her reputation for beauty. I have
          sometimes feared lest I should do the same, and so distort the face of
          Christ, and so fail of giving the true likeness of his character that
          you would not love him. Oh! could you see him! If he could stand here
          for one moment, and tell you that he was meek and lowly in heart. Oh,
          methinks you would run to him and say, |Jesus, we come Thou meek and
          lowly Messiah, be thou our all!| Nay, you would not come; I am
          mistaken. If sovereign grace draw you not under the sound of the
          gospel, neither would you be converted though Christ should appear
          before you. But hear now the message of that gospel -- |Believe on the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved; for he that believeth on
          him, and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not, must be
          damned.|<br />
