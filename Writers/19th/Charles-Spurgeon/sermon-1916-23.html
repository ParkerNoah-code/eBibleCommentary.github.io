        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>Published on Thursday, June 8th, 1916.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.</p>
        <p>On Lord's day Evening, January 21st, 1872.</p>
        <p>
          |In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language
          of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called the
          city of destruction. In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord
          in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof
          to the Lord. And it all be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord
          of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord
          because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a Saviour, and a
          great one, and he shall deliver them. And the Lord shall be known to
          Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do
          sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and
          perform it. And the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal
          it: and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be intreated
          of them, and shall heal them. In that day shall there be a highway out
          of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the
          Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the
          Assyrians. In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
          Assyria, even blessing in the midst of the land: whom the Lord of
          hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria
          the, work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.| -- Isaiah
          19:18-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS is a very remarkable prophecy. Attempts have been made to explain
          it, as if it were already fulfilled. I believe all such attempts to be
          utter failures. This promise stands on record to be, fulfilled at some
          future day In those bright days for which some of us are looking, when
          the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, so the waters cover
          the sea, then shall this word to Egypt be verified; yea, and God shall
          be glorified both by Egypt and Assyria, as well as in the land of
          Israel. This ought to be an encouragement to carry on missionary
          operations with great vigour. Here is a distinct promise for Assyria
          and for Egypt. Let not the missionary be afraid, even if for thousands
          of years to come there should be little apparent success to the
          preaching of the gospel. If the Lord should tarry another six thousand
          years, ay, sixty thousand years -- and he may -- we are still to go on
          working, and still to go on labouring, looking for his coming, and
          expecting it, but not relaxing our efforts because he pleases to delay
          it, for the Lord has sworn that all flesh shall know his glory, and
          you may depend upon it, there is no spot of earth that shall be left
          to be Satan's dominion. It shall be conquered for Christ, and in truth
          he shall |see of the travail of his soul, and he shall be satisfied.|
          It is most encouraging to find Egypt mentioned. You find it in one of
          the Psalms, |Princes shall come out of Egypt, and they shall come out
          of Ethiopia.| Now this I believe to be the litera1 meaning of the
          passage. You must understand that the prophecy was given to the people
          of Israel, and it was given to them, as it were, to children that were
          using types and figures. It speaks in their language. Hence it speaks
          of altars, and pillars, and oblations, all of which are to be
          understood now in the spiritual sense. The Church of God has come to
          her manhood, in which she has done with material altars and material
          oblations, seeing that she has Christ to be her only altar, her only
          priest, and prayer and praise to be the spiritual oblation which she
          shall bring. I understand the prophecy to be, in brief, just this. In
          the latter day, Egypt will be converted, and Assyria too, and wonders
          of grace will be performed in that land, and the people of the land
          shall with delight worship the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said this, I am now going to use the text for another purpose.
          Here is a wonderful display of the grace of God in this promise to
          Egypt. I see the very heart of God revealed. I see a display of what
          God will do, not to Egypt only, but to others also, and though we have
          much to say, we will try to open up, in as few particulars as we can
          make them, the display of grace which God gives among the sons of men.
          We begin thus: --
        </p>
        <p>I. THE GRACE OF GOD OFTEN COMES TO THE VERY WORST OF MEN.</p>
        <p>
          It is promised to Egypt. Now Egypt was the nation which was the type
          of God's enemies. It was over Egypt that he triumphed at the Red Sea,
          when Pharaoh said, |Who is the Lord?| and we regard Egypt as always
          being typical of the enemies of God -- the peculiar and chief enemies.
          Yet the grace of God is to come to Egypt. And so will it come often to
          the worst enemies that God has. Saul of Tarsus, foaming at the mouth
          with rage against the Christ of God, was met and conquered by eternal
          love, and his heart was renewed, and he was made an apostle. And
          oftentimes since then, electing love has chosen those that were most
          furious against Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit has come upon
          them, and turned the lions into lambs, and made them lie down at the
          feet of the Saviour. Let us have hope for the worst of men, and let
          the worst of men have hope for themselves under the gospel of Jesus
          Christ. The Egyptians were a peculiarly debased people as to their
          idolatry. If you go into the British Museum you will still see the
          cats, the crocodiles, the scarlet ibis, which they were accustomed to
          worship. Besides that, it was one of the sarcasms of the Roman poets
          that the Egyptians worshipped gods which they grew in their own
          gardens. They had the sacred beetle, the sacred mouse, and I know not
          what. And yet, degraded as they were by idolatry, the grace of God was
          to come to them. And men may have gone far into superstition; they may
          have debased even their own intellect by what they have tried to
          believe, and forced themselves down into the very deeps of
          superstition, and yet, for all that, the grace of God can come to them
          and lift them up. And the Egyptian were degraded politically too, for
          we read in one passage of the prophets that Egypt shall be the basest
          of all nations; and yet, though the basest of nations in that respect,
          the grace of God shall coma to them. Oh! how wondrous is the
          sovereignty of God! The devil cannot dye a soul so scarlet in sin but
          what the blood of Christ can make it white as snow. Satan cannot drive
          a chosen sheep of Christ so far on the mountains of vanity, or into
          the deserts of sin, but what the great Shepherd of the sheep can find
          that sheep, and bring it back again. There is hope for the mart
          sunken. There is hope for those that grovel, and that sink in the mire
          The infinite compassion of God can reach them, and the eternal power
          of God can lift them up.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one singular note in the text, that one of the cities in
          that land of Egypt (if I read the text aright) that was to be saved
          was called the City of Destruction. It had come to be named by that
          name, and yet, think of that, God looked upon it with mercy. Now there
          are in villages, and there are in towns, and certainly there are in
          London, men that have become so notorious for every sort of vice and
          sin that they are only known as the devil's own servants; and if
          anybody in the place were to speak of them, it would be with no
          question about the horrible condition of their minds and the state of
          their character. And yet in how many cases has the Lord been pleased
          to make such beings, new men in Christ Jesus! I have some in my mind's
          eye now, who have been to me a source of unutterable joy, whose
          characters were known, and certainly not admired. They were the dread
          of all with whom they dwelt. I remember one whose fist had many a time
          laid low his adversary, and whose oaths, and cursings, and songs at
          midnight often made the village tremble when he was filled with drink.
          But what a humble child he became when at last the gospel brought him
          down! How changed and how quiet was his manner when Jesus Christ had
          renewed his soul -- something like John Bunyan with his drink and his
          Sabbath breakings -- but what a saint was he when bowed at his
          Saviour's feet, he found his sins forgiven! We must not say, |Our
          children are hopeful, and God will save them, but we cannot expect him
          to look upon the fallen and degraded.| Ah! if, is Pharisaism that
          would make us speak so. The gospel has found some of its brightest
          jewels in the lowest haunts of vice. Bear it, bear it into the caves
          of darkness, where the blackness seems to be palpable, and to hang
          like the glooms of death -- bear ye aloft the everlasting torch, which
          the divine Lord himself has kindled, and you shall discover by its
          light some precious blood -- redeemed ones, who shall be to the praise
          of the glory of his grace. |One shall be called the City of
          Destruction, but thus saith the Lord, I have delivered it, I will save
          it, for my name's sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this ought to be very encouraging to every hearer present, for
          where there is mercy proclaimed to the chief of sinners, there is
          encouragement to every form of sinner to come humbly to the heavenly
          Father, and plead the precious blood of Jesus, and obtain life and
          peace. God grant we may be led there for his name's sake! But now the
          second observation is that grace is displayed in our text from the
          fact that: --
        </p>
        <p>II. GOD'S GRACE SENDS A SAVIOUR.</p>
        <p>
          Note, too, that he adds this word, |A GREAT ONE, and he shall deliver
          them.| Beloved friends, you know, all of you, what I have to say, but
          yet, though you know it, I know no story ever make score glad your
          spirit than the old, old story of the Saviour. He that has same to
          save us is Jesus, the Son of God; to save us from every stain of sin;
          to save us from our propensity to sin, from the power of our habits,
          and from the snares of Satan. He has come to save us from the death
          eternal, to save us from the wrath to come. God has sent us a Saviour.
          We could not have saved ourselves, but one has come who can. The text
          says that Saviour is a great one. Oh! I wanted a great Saviour. A
          little Saviour would not have answered my turn, for great sin wanted a
          great atonement, and my hard heart wanted great grace to soften it
          down. Now he that came to save us was God himself -- Jesus -- nothing
          less than God -- counting it not robbery to be equal with God. He is
          great in his nature, for as God he is infinite -- omnipotent. He is
          great also in what he has done. Look to him on the cross; it is the
          Son of God pouring out his life for sinners that they may live through
          his death. There most be great merit in such a sacrifice. I never dare
          believe in any limited merit in Christ. He who gave himself there upon
          the cross, being very God of very God, though certainly man -- there
          can be no limit set to the value of the atonement which he made. Oh!
          beloved, it is a great Saviour that God gives. And now that he has
          risen from the dead, he stands before God to plead for us, and it is
          no little plea -- no plea which might be put back or put off. With
          authority he pleads before his Father's throne, points to his own
          wounds, and the Father's heart always yields to the Son's
          intercession. You have a great Saviour, for he is a great pleader.
          And, besides that, all power is in his hands; the keys of death and
          hell are at his girdle, and the government shall be upon his
          shoulders, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the
          Mighty God. Oh! what a Saviour we have! Dare we doubt him? When we
          cast ourselves upon him, is there not an end to all our fears, for
          Jesus is mighty to save,
        </p>
        <p>
          And what a word that is in the text?|a Saviour and a great one, and he
          shall deliver them|! God did not send Christ at a haphazard. Jesus did
          not come here to save those who might perchance be saved -- to make
          men salvable, but he will save all he came to save. Those on whom he
          fixed his eye of everlasting love, for whom the precious drops were
          shed -- these he will, by the power of his arm, pluck from the jaws of
          the lion, because, with the blood of his heart he had redeemed them.
          |He shall deliver them.| Oh! you that trust in Jesus, lay this word
          home. May the Spirit of God lay it home to you. He shall deliver them
          from all temptation, from all trial, from all affliction, from death
          itself. |He shall deliver them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now put the two points together. We have mentioned that the grace of
          God comes to the greatest of sinners, and it brings to them a Saviour,
          and a great one, and I have laid open to you something of the heart of
          God in the greatness of his compassion. But we must pass on. Where the
          grace of God comes, it seems from the text that: --
        </p>
        <p>III. IT CHANGES MEN'S LANGUAGE.</p>
        <p>
          Turn to the 18th verse. |In that day shall five cities in the land of
          Egypt speak the language of Canaan| -- the spiritual meaning of which
          is that the grace of God shall make men speak that holy and pure
          language which is the mark of a child of God. O dear hearer, if the
          grace of God ever meets with you, your friends will know it -- every
          one -- by your conversation. That man could not speak without an oath;
          there will be no oath now. When he did speak, it was in a proud,
          boastful, hectoring way about himself. Ah! you will hardly know him to
          be the same man; for he will speak so humbly and so gently, and when
          he comes to speak about himself he will have the tears in his eyes to
          think of what he used to be, and what the grace of God has done for
          him now. Then his language would be lascivious and unclean at times,
          but now he desires not even to hear of such things, much less to
          mention them; for it is a shame for a Christian to speak of the things
          which are done by many in secret. The grace of God soon rinses out a
          man's mouth. His wife knows it; his children know it; his workfolk
          know it; and though some of them will think him a fool to speak after
          the way in which he now does though he does not imitate the language
          of Christians, and is not a cant, yet there is something about his
          very brogue and talk that might make men say, |Thou also west with
          Jesus of Nazareth, for thy speech betrayeth thee.| Oh! would not it be
          a mercy if God would change the speech of some in London! Even our
          boys in the streets sometimes talk in a way that is enough to make
          your blood chill. Foul words are very common in our streets and
          elsewhere. O sovereign grace, come and visit these, and they shall
          speak no longer the language of Babylon and the language of Belial,
          but they shall speak the language of Canaan, for God shall give them a
          pure language. When you hear men that once could curse begin to pray,
          when those who were given to blasphemies begin to pray, and when,
          instead of hearing the noise of strife in the working-man's house, you
          hear the song of praise, then is fulfilled the saying that is written,
          |In that day shall five cities speak the language of Canaan. and swear
          to the Lord of Hosts.| But I must pass on. Where the grace of God
          comes: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. IT SETS MEN ON HOLY SERVICE.</p>
        <p>
          |There shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of
          :Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. |When a man is
          in sin he worships himself, or he serves his pleasure and Satan; but
          when the grace of God comes, the man begins at once to serve God, and
          becomes God's servant. I am sure I know houses now that have an altar
          to God in them -- the family altar -- where you would not have thought
          such a thing could ever have been. I know some, too, that will this
          very day give of their substance to God, who two or three years ago
          would have scorned the act. They would have said it was a waste of
          money altogether to give anything to the cause of the Most High. There
          are some teaching at the Sabbath school, and spending the day of rest
          in, perhaps, the hardest toil of the week, and doing it very
          cheerfully too, who once would have laughed to scorn any proposal that
          they should have done any such thing. But the Lord, when he gets men's
          hearts, and washes away their sins, takes them into his service, and
          males those who were most ready to serve Satan become most willing to
          serve him. Is not this true -- I appeal to many here present -- is it
          not your delight now to do all you can for the Lord Jesus Christ?
          Perhaps, however, while you say |Yes,| you also add, |But I do not do
          half as much as I should, nor as I ought. |You feel precisely as I
          also felt -- and I must make the same confession as yourself. But,
          brothers and sisters, do not let it end in confession. Let us wake up
          and do more; for the love that saved us, the love that bought us at
          such a price, ought not to be recompensed so poorly as it has been.
          And let us pray for the grace of God, that we may ever have an altar
          in our own hearts, and be ourselves the sacrifice -- that our whole
          life may be a life of consecration to the living God. Oh! that our
          common dress might be as priestly vestment, and our ordinary meals as
          sacraments, and ourselves as priests unto the living God; our whole
          life a psalm, and our whole being a hallelujah to the Most High! Where
          the grace of God comes with power, it makes the worst of men become
          the boss, and the lowest of the low become true servants of the living
          God. |Can it be?| says one; |can I ever be a servant of God| Ah! yes:
          hark to the song of heaven! |We have washed our robes| -- then they
          needed washing -- |and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, Glory
          be to him who hath made us kings and priests unto our God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The next display of divine grace in the text is to be seen in this,
          that where the grace of God comes: --
        </p>
        <p>V. IT TEACHES MEN TO PRAY.</p>
        <p>
          We read in the 20th verse, |They shall cry unto the Lord because of
          oppressors.| This is a kind of prayer that only God can teach us. You
          can easily learn to say a form of prayer, or to read one from a book,
          but a prayer that can fairly be called a cry is the fruit of grace.
          The cry is the natural expression of distress. There is no hypocrisy
          in a cry. When one is sore sick and ready to die, and cries out in
          anguish, it is the genuine expression of an oppressed spirit. And God
          always teaches his children to pray such prayers an those. And oh! how
          sweetly will saved souls pray next to the songs of angels, I think the
          prayers of new converts are among the sweetest things that ever reach
          our ears. When we have been a long time professors, we are very apt to
          get into a sort of stilted mode of talking to God in prayer, and men
          that have more gifts than graces will spend the time in words, words,
          words. But oh! how has my heart leaped when I have heard a cry, such
          as |God, be merciful to me, a sinner!| when some soul, ready to burst
          with fear of the wrath to come, has cried out, |Jesus, Lord, have
          mercy upon me!| or when some heart that has just found Jesus has
          praised and magnified the exceeding mercy that has put away its sin.
          Christ can teach the blasphemer to pray; he can take the profane into
          his school, and teach them all to cry, and what all the clergy and
          ministry in the land could not do, namely, teach a man to pray one
          sincere prayer, God the Holy Ghost can do to the very offscouring and
          the scum of the universe, when once he comes to deal with them in the
          way of grace. Wonders of grace to God belong. He that teaches us to
          pray will teach us to praise him in heaven. The soul that lisps out
          its desires sincerely to God shall one day sing with cherubim and
          seraphim before the eternal throne. But I must hasten on. Where grace
          comes: --
        </p>
        <p>VI. IT INSTRUCTS MEN.</p>
        <p>
          We learn this from the next verse, |And the Lord shall be known in
          Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day.| It is a
          very serious evil with many hearers that they are altogether ignorant
          of the things of God; but it is delightful to observe how sweetly the
          Holy Spirit can teach. I have spoken lately with some whom God has
          called by his grace during the past few weeks, and I have been
          surprised that, although they had never been Bible readers, nor
          received any religious instruction in their youth, when the grace of
          God showed them their sin, he did it thoroughly, and when he showed
          them the Saviour, he did it in a wondrous way, so that when they came
          to read the Bible it was not difficult to them to understand it, nor
          to lay hold upon it with delight, and some have become well instructed
          in the things of the kingdom in a very short time indeed. There is no
          teacher like the Holy Spirit! |All thy children shall be taught of the
          Lord,| and when he teaches they are taught indeed. What boots it to a
          man to know all earthly knowledge if he knows not his God? But where
          grace comes, the man is no longer a stranger to the Lord; he knows the
          Father, the Son, the Spirit. He must know the Father, for he has
          become a child. He must know the Son, for he is his only confidence.
          He must know the Spirit, for it is the Spirit that dwelleth in him,
          and hath renewed him. Oh! that God would be pleaded to-night to take
          some fresh scholars into his school! Don't say, |I am poor and
          illiterate.| What matters that? With the Lord to teach you, you will
          make an apt scholar. We can only teach your ears; he can teach your
          hearts. We can only write the copy in a book, but he can write it on
          the fleshy tablets of your souls. Never despair of being instructed in
          the things of heaven. The Lord can graciously instruct you, and if he
          leads you to-night to receive the Saviour -- the great one -- he will
          begin the divine teaching which will end in your being complete in
          Christ, and your entering into his glory. I want you to notice a
          little more. Where the grace of God comes into a man's heart: --
        </p>
        <p>VII. IT MAKES EVEN TROUBLE A BLESSING TO HIM</p>
        <p>
          Read the 22nd verse. |The Lord shall smite Egypt| -- there is the
          trouble-|he shall smite| -- there is the trouble again-|and heal it|
          -- there is the mercy -- |and they shall return even to the Lord, and
          he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.| An ungodly man
          when he is in trouble, has nothing whatever to sustain him, and no
          good comes out of the trouble. But get the heart renewed, and let the
          man receive the Saviour, and perhaps the greatest mercies he has are
          those which are blessings in disguise. I read a story the other day --
          an incident which happened to a City Missionary. He was preaching one
          night out in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and there was a man -- an extremely
          aged man, who had lost his wife, and lived in a garret alone. He had
          scarcely a rag upon him and was nearly starved, and he was going out
          to commit suicide, but, moved by curiosity, he listened to the
          preaching of the gospel, and it saved his soul. It turned out that he
          had once been worth £100,000, and had been a distinguished merchant,
          but had lost his all in a foolish speculation, and had come down from
          the heights of riches to the lowest poverty, and at an extreme age he
          found Christ. The missionary found him friends who kept him with about
          enough to keep body and soul together -- a humble crust in a very
          lowly, solitary room -- but he used to say that now he had found the
          Lord; but he might never have found him if he had not lost all his
          wealth, and he looked upon it as the greatest blessing that had ever
          occurred to him, that he was brought to such beggary, that he was able
          and willing to stand in the street to listen to a sermon; for he said
          that in his riches he had despised the gospel, and had been altogether
          an atheist and an unbeliever but now, when brought to the lowest,
          Christ had found him, and he had more happiness with his cross than he
          had with his wealth. Oh! get the grace of God in your heart, and then
          broken limbs will be a bleeding. That long depression of trade that
          brought you oft low will appear a very different thing now. Your lot
          is very lowly now perhaps, and your toils severe, but God's grace will
          gild all these dark things in such a way that you shall even learn to
          glory in tribulation also, and bless the Lord that he did not leave
          you to be a stranger to him, but made you his child and, therefore,
          made you feel his rod for what son is there whom his father chasteneth
          not? Beloved, what a blessing it is to have the grace of God, seeing
          it turns adverse circumstances into true prosperity and makes our
          losses to be our lasting gains! One other reflection, and that is this
          concerning the grace of God: --
        </p>
        <p>VIII. IT CHANGES THE RELATIONS OF MEN ONE TO ANOTHER.</p>
        <p>
          Read the 23rd verse. |In that day there shall be a highway out of
          Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the
          Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the
          Assyrians.| Now the Egyptians and the Assyrians were enemies to one
          another; they were always fighting. There was a bloody feud and war
          between them century after century; but when the grace of God shall
          visit them both, there shall be no more fighting; the Egyptian shall
          go and visit the Assyrian, and the Assyrian shall visit the Egyptian.
          Have you never met with a case? Two brothers were at enmity, and would
          not speak to each other. One of them was saved by grace, and he
          thought, |Oh! if my brother John might be converted!| He wanted to
          fall into his brother's arms and make it all up, and be friends again.
          Meanwhile, brother John had heard the gospel somewhere else, and his
          soul had been saved, and he goes to find out the other brother, and
          all are reconciled, and the families that had been at a distance are
          knit together in love. Oh! the gospel soon breaks down barriers. I
          won't give a penny for your religion if you are at enmity with anybody
          -- if you can say of anyone of your kith and kin, |I will never speak
          to them again.| Mind, in that day when you appear before God, how can
          you expect mercy? Well, now, genuine grace makes us forgive as we have
          been forgiven, and it establishes intercommunications between those
          who had long been enemies to one another. Should there happen to be in
          this place at this time any that have long been at variance, I believe
          that there is no way of establishing a lasting love between you like
          your both loving Jesus Christ. If you cannot meet anywhere else, you
          are sure to meet if you come to the cross. A common Saviour will hind
          you together. Bought with the same blood, and filled with tile same
          divine life, you will become members of the same mystical body; you
          cannot help loving each other. Oh! that God would put an end in the
          world to all wars between nations, as well as all strifes between
          individuals. It won't come about by trade, nor yet be politics, nor by
          anything of man's devising; but if the gospel spreads, if God converts
          Egypt and converts Assyria, then Egypt will not desire war with Asia,
          nor Assyria with Egypt, but they shall be one in Christ Jesus the
          Lord. Wonders of grace! wonders of grace, that those that hated should
          love, and enemies should become friends. We will close with these last
          words. Where the grace of God comes: --
        </p>
        <p>IX. IT MAKES MEN TO BE BLESSED, AND TO BE A BLESSING.</p>
        <p>
          You will find that affirmed in the last two verses. |They shall be a
          blessing in the midst of the land, and it shall be said, Blessed be
          Egypt, my people.| The man that was accursed before, and was a curse,
          becomes blessed, and is a blessing. I will not enlarge upon it, but I
          will say this to you, the members of the church. It has delighted me
          to find the many earnest hearts there are here that are trying, to do
          good, some in one way, and some in another. I would in every case, if
          my encouragement were worth your having, give it you very heartily.
          But, beloved, if I do not know of it, and if no one knows of it but
          yourself and God, go on, go on. It is God's work to save souls, and
          you are workers together with him. Oh! this city wants you -- wants
          ten thousand earnest spirits. The lodging-houses want you; the alleys
          and the courts want you; the poor want you; the rich want you. If you
          have anything to say of the remedy which wisdom has prepared for the
          remedy of sins disease, the millions want it. They won't come to hear
          the gospel presaged, take it to their houses, carry it to their doors.
          If they reject a Saviour, let it not he for want of your hunting after
          them. Push it in their way. Sow beside all waters. In season and out
          of season teach ye the Word. Ye know not where God may bless you. But
          never be discouraged because of the badness of the neighbourhood, or
          the lowness of the character of the people. If Egypt shall be saved,
          have faith for this Egypt. If Assyria shall be saved, have confidence
          in God for those who are often worse than heathens, and you shall have
          your reward in that day when he of the pierced hand shall distribute
          crowns to those who faithfully serve him. Rewards, not of debt, but of
          grace, shall be given to the most obscure and unknown of you, who for
          his sake have sought to teach little children or to reclaim the adult
          who had fallen into sin. Take courage -- your work of faith and labour
          of love are not in vain in the Lord, and will do wonders yet to the
          praise of his grace. And as to you that are not saved. I have been
          saying great things of encouragement to you. I don't know who may take
          hold of them, but if there were one here who should reckon himself to
          be quite out of hope, it is to that man I spoke; and if there is a man
          here who says. |You don't mean me; you don't know my character,| I
          will suppose it to be the worst character that was ever heard of -- I
          meant you. He is |able to save unto the uttermost than that come unto
          God by him.| |All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
          men.| Seek ye the Lord! Confess your sins to him. Weep out your
          confession with your head on your Father's bosom and say, |Forgive me,
          forgive me for thy Son's sake,| and it shall be done unto you. God
          grant it may be done, even now: for his name's sake! Amen.<br />
