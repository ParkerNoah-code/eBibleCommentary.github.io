          17. Do good to thy servant The term gml gamal, which some render to
          requite, does not, among the Hebrews, import mutual recompense, but
          frequently signifies to confer a benefit, as in Psalm 116:7, and many
          other passages. Here it must be viewed as expressive of free favor.
          The words, however, may admit of two senses. They may be read as a
          separate clause, in this manner: O God! display thy goodness to thy
          servant, and thus I shall live, or then I shall esteem myself happy.
          Or the verse may form one connected statement: O God! grant to thy
          servant the favor that, while I live, I may keep thy commandments. If
          the former lection is adopted, then, by these words, the prophet
          declares that, without the favor of God, he is like a dead man; that
          though he might abound in every thing else, yet he could not subsist
          without feeling that God was propitious towards him. The latter
          interpretation is preferable, That the prophet asks as a principal
          favor, that, while he lives, he may devote himself entirely to God;
          being fully persuaded that the grand object of his existence consists
          in his exercising himself in his service, an object which he firmly
          resolves to pursue. For this reason these two clauses are connected
          together, that I may live, and keep thy word. |I desire no other mode
          of living than that of approving myself to be a true and faithful
          servant of God.| All wish God to grant them a prolongation of their
          life; a wish after which the whole world ardently aspire, and yet
          there is scarcely one among a hundred who reflects upon the purpose
          for which he ought to live. To withdraw us from cherishing such
          irrational propensities, the prophet here describes the main object of
          our existence. He declares it to be owing to the peculiar grace of the
          Holy Spirit, that any person keeps the law of God. Had he imagined
          that the preparing oneself for the observance of his law depended on
          his own free will, then this prayer would have been nothing else than
          downright hypocrisy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very similar is the doctrine contained in the next verse. Having
          acknowledged, that power to keep the law is imparted to men by God,
          he, at the same time, adds, that every man is blind, until he also
          enlighten the eyes of his understanding. Admitting that God gives
          light to us by his word, the prophet here means that we are blind amid
          the clearest light, until he remove the veil from our eyes. When he
          confesses that his eyes are veiled and shut, rendering him unable to
          discern the light of the heavenly doctrine, until God, by the
          invisible grace of his Spirit, open them, he speaks as if he were
          deploring his own blindness, and that of the whole human race. But,
          while God claims this power for himself, he tells us that the remedy
          is at hand, provided we do not, by trusting to our own wisdom, reject
          the gracious illumination offered to us. Let us learn, too, that we do
          not receive the illumination of the Spirit of God to make us contemn
          the external word, and take pleasure only in secret inspirations, like
          many fanatics, who do not regard themselves spiritual, except they
          reject the word of God, and substitute in its place their own wild
          speculations. Very different is the prophet's aim, which is to inform
          us that our illumination is to enable us to discern the light of life,
          that God manifests by his word. He designates the doctrine of the law,
          marvelous things, to humble us, to contemplate with admiration its
          height; and to convince us the more of our need of the grace of God,
          to comprehend the mysteries, which surpass our limited capacity. From
          which we infer, that not only the ten commandments are included in the
          term la but also the covenant of eternal salvation, with all its
          provisions, which God has made. And knowing, as we do, that Christ,
          |in whom are hid all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom,| |is the
          end of the law,| we need not be surprised at the prophet commending
          it, in consequence of the sublime mysteries which it contains,
          Colossians 2:3; Romans 10:4
        </p>
        <p>
          19. I am a stranger on the earth. It is proper to inquire into the
          reason for his calling himself a sojourner and stranger in the world.
          The great concern of the unholy and worldly is to spend their life
          here easily and quietly; but those who know that they have their
          journey to pursue, and have their inheritance reserved for them in
          heaven, are not engrossed nor entangled with these perishable things,
          but aspire after that place to which they are invited. The meaning may
          be thus summed up: |Lord, since I must pass quickly through the earth,
          what will become of me if I am deprived of the doctrine of thy law?|
          We learn from these words from what point we must commence our
          journey, if we would go on our way cheerfully unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, God is said to conceal his commandments from those whose eyes
          he does not open, because, not being endued with spiritual vision, in
          seeing they see not, so that what is before their eyes is hid from
          them. And, to demonstrate that he does not present his request in a
          careless manner, the prophet adds, that his affection for the law is
          most intense; for it is no common ardor which is expressed by him in
          the following language, My soul is rent with the desire it hath at all
          times unto thy judgments. As the man who may concentrate all his
          thoughts on one point with such intensity as almost to deprive him of
          the power of perception, may be said to be the victim of his
          intemperate zeal, so the prophet declares the energy of his mind to be
          paralyzed and exhausted by his ardent love for the law. The clause, at
          all times, is meant to express his perseverance; for it may
          occasionally happen that a man may apply himself with great ardor to
          the study of the heavenly doctrine; but it is only temporary-his zeal
          soon vanishes away. Steadfastness is therefore necessary, lest,
          through weariness, we become faint in our minds.
        </p>

          21. Thou hast destroyed the proud. Others render it:, Thou hast
          rebuked the proud; a translation of which the Hebrew term gr, gaar,
          admits when the letter v, beth, is joined with it in construction; but
          this being awaiting, it is better to render it destroy It makes,
          however, little difference to the main drift of the passage, there
          being no doubt that the intention of the prophet is, to inform us that
          God's judgments instructed him to apply his mind to the study of the
          law; and certainly this is an exercise which we ought on no account to
          defer till God visit us with chastisement.. But when we behold him
          taking vengeance upon the wicked, and the despisers of his word, we
          must be stupid, indeed, if his rod do not teach us wisdom; and,
          doubtless, it is an instance of special kindness on God's part, to
          spare us, and only to terrify us from afar, that he may bring us to
          himself without injuring or chastising us at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not without reason that he denominates all unbelievers proud,
          because it is true faith alone which humbles us, and all rebellion is
          the offspring of pride. From this we learn how profitable it is to
          consider carefully and attentively the judgments of God, by which he
          overthrows such haughtiness. When the weak in faith see the wicked
          rise in furious. opposition against God, arrogantly casting off all
          restraint, and holding all religion in derision with impunity, they
          begin to question whether there be a God who sits as judge in heaven.
          God may, for a time, wink at this: by-and-bye, we witness him setting
          forth some indication of his judgment, to convince us that he hath not
          in vain uttered threatening against the violators of his law; and we
          ought to bear in mind that all who depart from him are reprobate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be carefully observed that, by wandering from his commandments,
          is not meant all kinds of transgression indiscriminately, but that
          unbridled licentiousness which proceeds from impious contempt of God.
          It is, indeed, given as a general sentence, that
        </p>
        <p>
          |every one is cursed who continueth not in all<br />things which are
          written,| Deuteronomy 27:26
        </p>
        <p>
          But as Godwin his paternal kindness, bears with those who fail through
          infirmity of the flesh, so here we must understand these judgments to
          be expressly executed upon the wicked and reprobate; and their end, as
          Isaiah declares, is,
        </p>
        <p>
          |that the inhabitants of the earth may learn righteousness,| (Isaiah
          26:9)
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Remove from me reproach This verse may admit of two senses: Let
          the children of God walk as circumspectly as it is possible for them
          to do, they will not escape being liable to many slanders, and
          therefore they have good reason to petition God to protect the
          unfeigned godliness which they practice against poisonous tongues. The
          following meaning may not inappropriately be given to the passage: O
          Lord, since I am conscious to myself, and thou art a witness of my
          unfeigned integrity, do not permit the unrighteous to sully my
          reputation, by laying unfounded accusations to my charge. But the
          meaning will be more complete if we read it as forming one continued
          sentence: O God, permit not the ungodly to mock me for endeavoring to
          keep thy law. For this impiety has been rampant in the world even from
          the beginning, that the sincerity of God's worshippers has been matter
          of reproach and derision; even as, at this day, the same reproaches
          are still cast upon God's children, as if not satisfied with the
          common mode of living, they aspired being wiser than others. That
          which was spoken by Isaiah must now be accomplished, |Behold I and my
          children, whom thou hast given me to be for a sign;| so that God's
          children, with Christ their head, are, among the profane, as persons
          to be wondered at. Accordingly, Peter testifies that they charge us
          with madness for not following their ways, (1 Peter 4:4;) and as this
          reproach -- the becoming the subjects of ridicule on account of their
          unfeigned affection for God's law -- tends to the dishonor of his
          name, the prophet very justly demands the suppression of all these
          taunts; and Isaiah also, by his own example, directs us to flee to
          this refuge, because, although the wicked may arrogantly pour out
          their blasphemies on the earth, yet God sitteth in heaven as our
          judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following verse, he states more plainly that it was not in vain
          he besought God to vindicate him from such calumnies; for he was held
          in derision, not only by the common people, and by the most abandoned
          of mankind, but also by the chief men, who sat as judges. The term, to
          sit, imports that they had spoken injuriously and unjustly of him, not
          merely in their houses and at their tables, but publicly and on the
          very judgment-seat, where it behooved them to execute justice, and
          render to every one his due. The particle gm, gam, which he employs,
          and which signifies also or even, contains an implied contrast between
          the secret whisperings of the common people, and the imperious
          decisions of these imperious men, enhancing still more the baseness of
          their conduct. Nevertheless, in the midst of all this he steadfastly
          persevered in following after godliness. Satan was assailing him with
          this device in order to drive him to despair, but he tells us that he
          sought a remedy from it in meditation on the law of God. We are here
          taught, that it is not unusual for earthly judges to oppress God's
          servants, and make a mock of their piety. If David could not escape
          this reproach, why should we, in these times, expect to do so? Let us
          further learn, that there is nothing more perverse than to place
          dependence upon the judgments of men, because, in doing so, we must,
          of necessity, constantly be in a state of vacillation. Let us
          therefore rest satisfied with the approbation of God, though men
          causelessly defame us -- not only men of low degree, but also the very
          judges themselves, from whom the utmost impartiality might be
          expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          24. Also thy testimonies are my delight The particle gm, gam, connects
          this with the preceding verse. To adhere unflinchingly to our purpose,
          when the world takes up an unjust opinion of us, and, at the same
          time, constantly to mediate on God's law, is an example of Christian
          fortitude seldom to be met with. The prophet now informs us how he
          overcame this temptation. Thy testimonies, says he, are my delight:
          |Although the cruel injustice of men, in charging me falsely, grieves
          and annoys me, yet the pleasurable delight which I take in thy law is
          a sufficient recompense for it all.| He adds, that God's testimonies
          are his counselors, by which we are to understand he did not rely on
          his own judgment simply, but took counsel from the word of God. This
          point ought to be carefully considered, inasmuch as we see how blind
          affection predominates in directing the lives of men. Whence does the
          avaricious man ask council, but from the erroneous principle which he
          has assumed, that riches are superior to every thing? Why does the
          ambitious man aspire after nothing so much as power, but because he
          regards nothing equal to the holding of honorable rank in the world?
          It is not surprising, therefore, that men are so grievously misled,
          seeing they give themselves up to the direction of such evil
          counselors. Guided by the word of God, and prudently yielding
          obedience to its dictates, there will then be no inlet to the deceits
          of our flesh, and to the delusions of the world, and we will stand
          invincible against all the assaults of temptation.<br />
