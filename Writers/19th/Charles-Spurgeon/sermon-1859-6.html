        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.230)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 26th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>

          |The Lord will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
          rereward.| -- Isaiah 52:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE CHURCH OF CHRIST is continually represented under the figure of an
          army; yet its Captain is the Prince of Peace; its object is the
          establishment of peace, and its soldiers are men of a peaceful
          disposition. The spirit of war is at the extremely opposite point to
          the spirit of the gospel. Yet nevertheless, the church on earth has,
          and until the second advent must be, the church militant, the church
          armed, the church warring, the church conquering. And how is this? It
          is in the very order of things that so it must be. Truth could not be
          truth in this world if it were not a warring thing, and we should at
          once suspect that it were not true if error were friends with it. The
          spotless purity of truth must always be at war with the blackness of
          heresy and lies. I say again, it would cast a suspicion upon its own
          nature; we should feel at once that it was not true, if it were not an
          enmity with the false. And so at this present time, the church of
          Christ, being herself the only incarnation of truth left upon this
          world, must be at war with error of every kind of shape; or if she
          were not, we should at once conclude that she was not herself the
          church of the living God. It is but a rule of nature that holiness
          must be at enmity with sin. That would be but a mock purity which
          could lie side by side with iniquity and claim its kinship. |Shall the
          throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee?| Shall Christ and Belial
          walk together? Shall the holy be linked with the unholy? If it were
          so, beloved, we might then not only suspect that the church was not
          the holy, universal and apostolic church; we might not only suspect
          it, but we might beyond suspicion pronounce a verdict upon her, |Thou
          art no more Christ's bride; thou art an antichrist, an apostate.
          Reprobate silver shall men call thee, because thou hast not learned to
          distinguish between the precious and the vile.| Thus, you see, if the
          church be a true church, and a holy church, she must be armed: there
          are so many untrue things and unholy things, that she must be
          perpetually with her sword in her hand, carrying on combat against
          them. And every child of God proveth by experience that this is the
          land of war. We are not yet come to the time when every man shall sit
          under his vine and under his fig tree, none daring to make him afraid.
          The mountains do not bring peace to the people, nor the little hills
          righteousness. On the contrary, the children of God hear the sound of
          war; the shrill clarion is constantly sounding in their ears; they are
          compelled to carry with them the sword and the shield, and constantly
          to gird their armor on, for they are not yet come to the land of
          peace; they are in an enemy's country, and every day will convince
          them that such is their position. Now, how comforting is this text to
          the believer who recognizes himself as a soldier, and the whole church
          as an army! The church has its van-guard: |Jehovah will go before
          you.| The church is also in danger behind; enemies may attack her in
          her hinder part, |and the God of Israel shall be her rereward.| So
          that the army is safe from enemies in front -- and God alone knoweth
          their strength and it is also perfectly secure from any foes behind,
          however malicious and powerful they may be; for Jehovah is in the van,
          and the covenant God of Israel is behind: therefore the whole army is
          safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall first consider this as it respects the church of God; and
          then, in the second place, I shall endeavour to consider it as it
          respects us, as individual believers. May God comfort our hearts while
          considering this precious truth!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, consider THE WHOLE CHURCH OF GOD AS AN ARMY. Remember that
          part of the host have crossed the flood; a large part of the army are
          standing this day upon the hills of glory; having overcome and
          triumphed. As for the rear, it stretches far into the future; some
          portions are as yet uncreated; the last of God's elect are not perhaps
          yet in existence. The rear-guard will be brought up in that day when
          the last vessel of mercy is full to the brim of grace, the last
          prodigal is restored to his Father's house, and the last of Christ's
          redeemed ones redeemed by power, as they were of old redeemed by
          blood. Now, cast your eyes forward to the front of the great army of
          God's elect, and you see this great truth coming up with great
          brilliance before you: |Jehovah shall go before you.| Is not this
          true? Have you never heard of the eternal counsel and of the
          everlasting covenant? Did that not go before the church? Yea, my
          brethren, it went before manhood's existence, before the creation of
          this world that was to be the stage whereon the church should play its
          part, before the formation of the universe itself, when as yet all
          things that we now behold were unborn, when God lived alone in
          solitary majesty without a fellow, when there were no creatures. If
          there were such an eternity, an eternity filled with the Creator, and
          not one creature with him, even then it was, that God determined in
          his mind that he would form a people to himself who should show forth
          his praise; it was then that he settled how men should be redeemed; it
          was then the council of peace was held between the three divine
          persons, and it was determined that the Father should give the Son,
          that the Son should give himself, that the Holy Spirit should be the
          active agent to fetch out all the lost sheep, and restore them to the
          fold. Oh! think, beloved, of that great text which says, |His goings
          forth were of old, even from everlasting.| Do not think that the
          gospel is a new thing; it is older than your hoary mountains, nay, it
          is older than the firstborn sons of light. Before that |beginning,|
          when God created the heavens and the earth, there was another
          |beginning,| for |In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
          God, and the Word was God.| And assuredly, the Gospel was ever in the
          Word, for Jesus was set up front everlasting as the great head of the
          covenant of grace. Behold, then, the glorious Jehovah in the Trinity
          of his persons, treading the pathless depths of eternity, that a way
          for his elect might be prepared herein. He has gone before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another view of the case. Jehovah shall go before you. Has he not
          gone before his church in act and deed? Perilous has been the journey
          of the church from the day when first it left Paradise even until now.
          When the church left Paradise, I say, for I believe that Adam and Eve
          were in the church of God, for I believe that both of them were
          redeemed souls, chosen of God, and precious. I see God give the
          promise to them before they leave the garden, and they go out from the
          garden, the church of God. Since that time, what a path has the church
          had to tread, but how faithfully hat Jehovah led the way. We see the
          floods gather round about her, but even then she floats safely in the
          ark which Jehovah had provided for her beforehand, for the Lord had
          gone before her. I see the church going out from Ur of the Chaldees.
          It is but a little church, with the patriarch Abraham at its head. I
          see that little church dwelling in an enemy's country, moving to and
          fro; but I observe how the Lord is its constant leader -- |When they
          went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
          he suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their
          sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.| I
          see the church afterwards going down to the land of the cruel
          Pharaohs. It was a black part of her pilgrimage, for she was going to
          the lash of the taskmaster and to the heat of the burning fiery
          furnace; but I see Joseph going down before, Jehovah's great
          representative; Joseph goeth down into Egypt, and he saith, |God sent
          me before you to provide a place for you in the time of famine.| So
          sings the Psalmist, |He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was
          sold for a servant: whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in
          iron: until the time that his word came: the word of the Lord tried
          him. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
          let him go free. He made him lord or his house, and ruler of all his
          substance: to bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
          wisdom. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
          of Ham.| But now the church has to come up out of Egypt, and God goes
          before her still; |But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and
          guided them in the wilderness like a flock. And he led them on safely
          so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.| The
          Red Sea is before them; Jehovah goes in front and dries up the sea.
          The desert must then be trodden; Jehovah marches in front, and
          scatters manna with both his hands; he splits the rock, and sends out
          a living stream. For forty years the church wanders there; Jehovah is
          with them; the fiery cloud-pillar leads them all their journey
          through. And now they come to the banks of Jordan; they are about to
          enter into the promised land; Jehovah goes before them and the Jordan
          is driven back, and the floods are dry. They came into the country of
          the mighty ones, the sons of Anak, men that were of the race of
          giants; but Jehovah had gone before them; the hornet was sent and the
          pestilence, so that when they came they said it was a land that did
          eat up the inhabitants thereof, for God himself with the sword and the
          pestilence was mowing down their foes that they might be an easier
          victory. |And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
          this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. He cast out the
          heaten also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and
          made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But why need I go through all the pages of the history of the church
          of God in the days of the old dispensation? Hath it not been true from
          the days of John the Baptist until now? Brethren, how can ye account
          for the glorious triumphs of the church if ye deny the fact that God
          has gone before her? I see the church emerge, as it were, from the
          bowels of Christ. Twelve fishermen -- what are these to do? Do? Why
          they are to shake the world, to uproot old systems of paganism that
          have become venerable, and whose antiquity seems a guarantee that men
          will never renounce them. These men are to blot out the name of
          Jupiter; they are to cast Venus from her licentious throne; they are
          to pull down the temple of Delphos, scatter all the oracles, and
          disrobe the priests: these men are to overthrow a system and an empire
          of error that has stood for thousands of years -- a system which has
          brought in to its help all the philosophy of learning and all the pomp
          of power; -- these twelve fishermen are to do it. And they have done
          it, they have done it. The gods of the heatens are cast clown; they
          only remain among us as memorials of men's folly; but who bows down to
          Jupiter now? Where is the worshipper of Ashtaroth? Who calls Diana a
          divinity? The twelve fishermen have done it; they have erased from the
          world the old system of superstition; it seemed old as the eternal
          hills, yet have they dug up its foundations and scattered them to the
          winds. Could they have accomplished it unless Jehovah had been in the
          van and led the way? No, beloved, if ye read the history of the
          church, ye will be compelled to confess that whenever she went forward
          she could discern the footsteps of Jehovah leading the way. Our
          missionaries in these later times tell us that, when hey went to the
          South Seas to preach the gospel, there was an evident preparedness in
          the minds of the people for the reception of the truth, and I believe
          that at this time, if the church were true to herself, there are
          nations and people and tribes that are just in the condition of the
          ancient Canaanites: the hornet is among them making way for the Lord's
          army to win an easy conquest. But sure I am that never minister
          ascends the pulpit, if he be a true minister of Christ; never
          missionary crosses the sea, never Sunday school teacher goes to his
          work, but that Jehovah goes before him to help him if he goes in
          earnest prayer and constant faith. If I were a poet I think I have a
          subject that might suggest a grand epic poem -- the march of the
          church through the world, with Jehovah in her fore front. See, when
          first she comes forth, |the kings of the earth stand up, and the
          rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his
          anointed.| Alas, poor church, what is now thy fate? But I hear a voice
          ahead. What is it? It is a laugh. Who laughs? Why the leader of the
          army laughs. |He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh at them. The
          Lord shall have them in derision.| And shall we that are behind be
          mourning? Shall the church tremble? Let her call to mind the days of
          old, and comfort herself, that the Breaker has gone up before her, and
          the King at the head of her. But the enemy approaches. They bring out
          the rack, the bloody sword, the burning faggot. The march of the
          church lies through the flames, the floods must be forded, torments
          must be endured. Did the church ever stop a moment in its march for
          all the martyrdoms that fell upon her like the drops of a fiery
          shower? Never, never did the church seem to march on with feet so
          ready, never were her steps so firm as when she dipped her foot each
          time in blood, and every moment passed through the fire. It was the
          marvel of those days that men were better Christians then, and more
          willing to make a profession of Christ than they are even now. And
          whereas this seems to be the day of cravens, the time of persecution
          was the age of heroes, the time of the great and the bold. And why?
          Because God had gone beforehand with his church, and provided stores
          of grace for stores of trouble, shelter and mercy for tempests and
          persecution, abundance of strength for a superfluity of trial. Happy
          is the church because God has gone before her. Whether it were over
          the tops of the mountains, where her pastors fell frozen by cold, or
          whether it were in the depths of the dungeon where her confessors
          expired upon the rack, whether it were in the flame or at the block,
          everywhere God went before his church, and she came forth triumphant
          because her great vanguard had cleared the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, we have come to the sweet part of the text, which
          saith, |And the God of Israel shall be the rereward.| The original
          Hebrew is, |God of Israel shall gather you up.| Armies in the time of
          war diminish by reason of stragglers, some of whom desert, and others
          of whom are overcome by fatigue; but the army of God is |gathered up;|
          none desert from it if they be real soldiers of the cross, and none
          drop down upon the road. The God of Israel gathers them up. He who
          goes before, like a shepherd before the flock, providing pasture for
          them, comes behind that he may gather the lambs in his arms -- that he
          may gently lead those that are with young. |The God of Israel is your
          rereward.| Now the church of Christ has been frequently attacked in
          the rear. It often happens that the enemy, tired of opposing the
          onward march by open persecution, attempts to malign the church
          concerning something that has either been taught, or revealed, or done
          in past ages. Now, the God of Israel is our rereward. I am never at
          trouble about the attacks of infidels or heretics, however vigorously
          they may assault the doctrines of the Gospel, I will leave them alone;
          I have no answer for their logic; if they look to be resisted by mere
          reason, they look in vain; I have the simple answer of an affirmation,
          grounded upon the fact that God had said it. It is the only warfare I
          will enter into with them. If they must attack the rear let them fight
          with Jehovah himself. If the doctrines of the Gospel be as base as
          they say they are, let them cast discredit upon God, who revealed the
          doctrines; let them settle the question between God's supreme wisdom
          and their own pitiful pretensions to knowledge. It is not for
          Christian men to fear about the rear of the church. The doctrines of
          the Gospel, which are like the heavy baggage carried in the rear, or
          like the great guns kept behind against the time when they are wanted
          in the hour of battle, these are quite safe. The Amalekites may fall
          upon the stuff, or the Philistines may attack the ammunition, all is
          safe, for God is in the rereward; and let them but appear against our
          rear, and they shall instantly be put to the rout.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I am thinking that perhaps the later trials of the church may
          represent the rereward. There are to come, perhaps, to the church, in
          days that are approaching, fiercer persecutions that she has ever
          known. We cannot tell, we are no pretenders to prophecy, but we know
          that it always has been so with the church -- a time of prosperity and
          then a period of persecution. She has a Solomon, and she reigns in all
          her glory under his shadow; hut in after years Antiochus oppresses
          her, and she needs a Judas Maccabæus to deliver her. Perhaps we are
          living in an age too soft for the church. The Capuan holidays that
          ruined the soldiers of Hannibal may rob the church now; ease and lack
          of persecution may put us off our guard. Perhaps, there may come yet
          fiercer times for us. I know not what is meant by the battle of
          Armageddon, but sometimes I fear we are to expect trial and trouble in
          years to come; but certain I am, however fierce those troubles shall
          be, that God, who has gone before his church in olden times, will
          gather up the rear, and she who has been Ecclesia victrix -- the
          church, the conqueror, will still be the same, and her rear shall
          constitute at last a part of the church triumphant, even as already
          glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you now conceive the last great day when Jehovah, the rereward
          shall gather up his people? The time is come; the last of the salt is
          about to be removed; the church of God is now about to be carried up
          to dwell with her husband. Do you see the church moving upwards
          towards heaven? Behind her she leaves a world in flames; she sees the
          earth destroyed, God removes it as a shepherd's tent; the inhabitants
          thereof are gone, and the tent must be folded up; as a vesture shall
          they be folded up, and they shall be changed. But between the church
          and a blazing world, between the church and the terrible destruction
          of hell, there is the bright pillar of God's presence -- black to his
          enemies behind, but bright to his church in front. The close of the
          great dispensation of the Mediator shall be that the God of Israel
          shall be all in all, his church shall be completely safe; he shall
          have gathered up all things in one, whether they be things in heaven
          or things on earth. Then shall the sonnet of the poet be more than
          fulfilled to the rejoicing and perfected church.
        </p>
        <p>|Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness,</p>
        <p>Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more;</p>
        <p>Bright o'er thy hills dawns the day-star of gladness:</p>
        <p>Arise, for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.</p>
        <p>Strong were thy foes, but the arm that subdued them,</p>
        <p>And scatter'd their legions, was mightier far;</p>
        <p>They fled, like the chaff, from the scourge that pursued them,</p>
        <p>Vain were their steeds, and their chariots of war.</p>
        <p>Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee</p>
        <p>Extoll'd with the harp and the timbrel should be:</p>
        <p>Shout, for the foe is destroy'd that enslaved thee,</p>
        <p>The oppressor is vanquish'd, and Zion is free.|</p>
        <p>
          II. Let us turn to the second part of the sermon. We are now come to
          the last Sabbath of the year. Two troubles present themselves, the
          future and the past. We shall soon launch into another year, and
          hitherto we have found our years, years of trouble. We have had
          mercies, but still we find this house of out pilgrimage is not an
          abiding city, not a mansion of peace and comfort. Perhaps we are
          trembling to go forward. Foreseeing trouble, we know not how we we
          shall be able to endure to the end. We are standing here and pausing
          for a while, sitting down upon the stone of our Ebenezer to rest
          ourselves, gazing dubiously into the future, saying, |Alas! what shall
          I do? Surely, I shall one day fall by the hand of the enemy.| Brother,
          arise, arise; anoint your head, and wash your face, and fast no
          longer; let this sweet morsel now cheer you; put this bottle to your
          lips, and let your eyes be enlightened: |The Lord Jehovah will go
          before you.| He has gone before you already. Your future path has all
          been marked out in the great decrees of his predestination. You shall
          not tread a step which is not mapped out in the great chart of God's
          decree. Your troubles have been already weighed for you in the scales
          of his love; your labour is already set aside for you to accomplish by
          the hand of his wisdom. Depend upon it.
        </p>
        <p>|Your times of trial and of grief,</p>
        <p>Your times of joy and sweet relief,</p>
        <p>All shall come and last and end</p>
        <p>As shall please your heavenly Friend.|</p>
        <p>
          Remember, you are not a child of chance. If you were, you might indeed
          fear. You will go nowhere next year except where God shall send you.
          You shall be thrust into the hot coals of the fire, but God shall put
          you there. You shall perhaps be much depressed in spirit, but that
          heaviness shall be for your good, and shall come from your Father; you
          shall have the rod, but it shall not be the rod of the wicked -- it
          shall be in God's hand. Oh! how comfortable the thought that
          everything is in the hand of God, and that all that may occur to me
          during the future years of my life is fore-ordained and overruled by
          the great Jehovah, who is my Father and my friend! Now stop,
          Christian, a moment, and realize the idea that God has gone before,
          mapping the way; and then let me ask you if you could now this morning
          be allowed to draw a fresh map, would you do it? If he should
          condescend to say, |Now your circumstances next year shall be just
          what you like; you shall have your own way, and go your own route to
          heaven, would you dare, even with God's permission, to draw a new
          chart?| If you should have that presumption, I know the result: you
          would find that you had gone the wrong way; you would soon be glad
          enough to retrace your step, and with many tears you would go to your
          heavenly Father, and say, |My Father, I have had enough to do with the
          helm of this ship; it is hard work to hold it; do what thou wilt with
          it; steer which way thou pleasest, though it be through the deepest
          floods and the hottest flame. I am weary, I sleep at the tiller, I
          cannot guide the ship, my tears fall fast from my eyes, for when I
          think to be wise I find myself to have committed folly; when I thought
          I was promoting my own advantage in my scheme, I find I am rushing
          into a sea of losses.| God, then, has gone before you in the decree of
          his predestination.
        </p>
        <p>
          And recollect, God has gone before you in all your future journey in
          the actual preparations of his providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not think I am capable this morning, for my mind seems to wander
          far more than I could desire, of sketching how it is, but so it is,
          that God always makes a providence beforehand ready for his people
          when they get to the place. My God does not hastily erect a tent over
          me when I come to a certain spot. No; he builds an inn of mercy, and
          before I get there he provides a bed of comfort, and stores up the old
          wines of grace, that I may feast upon them. And all this is done long
          before I come to the actual necessity. None of us can tell how the
          future leans on the past, how a simple act of to-day shall bring about
          a grand event in a hundred years. We do not know how the future lies
          in the bowels of the post, and how what is to be is the child of that
          which is. As all men spring from their progenitors, so the providence
          of to-day springs from the providence of a hundred years past. The
          events of next year have been forestalled by God in what he has done
          this year and years before. I am certain of this, that on the road I
          am to travel during the next year, everything is ready for me. I am
          not going a road of hills and deep valleys, but I have heard the voice
          of one crying in the wilderness, |Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
          straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be
          exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the
          crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: and the
          glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
          together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.| |I will open
          rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I
          will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of
          water.| |And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I
          will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness
          light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do
          unto them, and not forsake them.| I say again, you are not going
          through a land that God has not prepared for you. O Israel, there is a
          well of Elim made for you long before you came out of Egypt, and there
          are palm trees that have been growing there that they might just come
          to the fruit-bearing state, and have fruit upon them, when you come
          there. O Israel, God is not going to extemporize a Canaan for you; it
          is ready made, it is even now flowing with milk and honey; the vines
          that are to bear you grapes of Eshcol are already there and coming to
          perfection. God has forestalled your trials and troubles for the next
          year. The Lord Jehovah has gone before you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also another phase of this subject. Jehovah has gone before
          us in the incarnation of Christ. As to our future troubles for next
          year and the remnant of our days, Jesus Christ has borne them all
          before. As for temptation, he |has been tempted in all points like as
          we are, yet without sin.| As for trials and sorrows, he has felt all
          we can possibly feel, and infinitely more. As for our difficulties,
          Christ has trodden the road before. We may rest quite sure that we
          shall not go anywhere where Christ has not gone. The way of God's
          people in providence is the exact track of Christ himself. The
          footsteps of the flock are identical with the footsteps of the
          shepherd, so far as they follow the leading and guidings of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is this reflection also, that, inasmuch as Christ has gone
          before us, he has done something in that going before, for he has
          conquered every foe that lies in his way. Cheer up now thou
          faint-hearted warrior. Not only has Christ travelled the road, but he
          has slain thine enemies. Dost thou dread sin? he has nailed it to his
          cross. Dost thou dread death? he has been the death of Death. Art thou
          afraid of hell? he has barred it against the advent of any of his
          children; they shall never see the gulf of perdition. Whatever foes
          may be before the Christian, they are all overcome. There are lions,
          but their teeth are broken; there are serpents, but their fangs are
          extracted; there rivers but they are bridged or fordable; there are
          flames, but we have upon us that matchless garment which renders us
          invulnerable to fire. The sword that has been forged against us is
          already blunted; the instruments of war which the enemy is preparing
          have already lost their point. God has taken away in the person of
          Christ all the power that anything can have to hurt us. Well then, the
          army may safely march on and you may go joyously along your journey,
          for all your enemies are conquered beforehand. What shall you do but
          march on to take the prey? They are beaten, they are vanquished; all
          you have to do is to divide the spoil. Your future life shall be only
          the dividing of the spoil. You shall, it is true, often dread combat;
          and you shall sometimes have to wield the spear, but your fight shall
          be with a vanquished foe. His head is broken; he may attempt to injure
          you, but his strength shall not be sufficient for his malicious
          design. Your victory shall he easy, and your treasure shall be beyond
          all count. Come boldly on then, for Jehovah shall go before you. This
          shall be our sweet song when we come to the river of death: Black are
          its streams, and there are terrors there of which I cannot dream. But
          shall I fear to go through the dark stream if Jehovah goes before me?
          There may be goblins of frightful shape, there may be horrors of a
          hellish hue, but thou, Jehovah, shalt clear the way, thou shalt bid
          each enemy begone, and each fiend shall flee at thy bidding. I may
          march safely on. So confident would I feel in this great vanguard,
          that shouldst thou bid me go through hell itself, I need not fear all
          the terrors of the place of doom; for if Jehovah went before, he would
          tread out even to the last spark the fire; he would quench even to the
          last flame that burning; and the child of God might march safely
          through the flame that had been quenched and the ashes that were
          extinguished. Let us therefore never be troubled about the future. It
          is all safe, for Jehovah has gone before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I hear one say, |The future seldom troubles me, sir; it is the
          past -- what I have done and what I have not done -- the years that
          are gone -- how I have sinned, and how I have not served my master as
          I ought. These things grieve me, and sometimes my old sins start up in
          my recollection and accuse me; What! shalt THOU be saved?' say they,
          Remember us.' And they spring up in number like the sands of the sea.
          I cannot deny that I have committed all these sins, nor can I say that
          they are not the most guilty of iniquities. Oh! it is the rereward
          that is most unsafe. I dead most the sins of the past.| O beloved, the
          God of Israel shall be your rereward. Notice the different titles. The
          first is |the Lord,| or properly |Jehovah| -- |Jehovah will go before
          you.| That is the I am, full of omniscience and omnipotence. The
          second title is |God of Israel,| that is to say, the God of the
          Covenant. We want the God of the Covenant behind, because it is not in
          the capacity of the I am, the omnipotent, that we require him to
          pardon sin, to accept our persons, to blot out the past, and to remove
          iniquity by the blood of Christ; it is as the God of the Covenant that
          he does that. He goes behind; here he finds that his child has left a
          black mark, and he takes that away; he finds here a heap of rubbish, a
          mass of broken good works, and here another load of evil, of filth,
          and he carefully removes all, so that in that track of his children
          there is not a spot or a blemish; and though they have trodden the
          road the most observant of their foes at the last great day shall not
          be able to find that they have done any mischief on the journey, or
          one wrong thing in all their march, for the God of Israel hath so
          swept the way that he has taken away their iniquities and cast their
          sins behind his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me always think, that I have God behind me as well as before
          me. Let not the memories of the past, though they cause me grief,
          cause me despair. Let me never bemoan because of past trial or past
          bereavement; let me never be cast down on account of past sin; but let
          me look to Christ for the pardon of the past, and to God for the
          sanctification of my past troubles. Let me believe that he who has
          cleared the way before me, has removed all enemies from behind me,
          that I am and must he perpetually safe. And now, are there any here
          to-day whose hearts God hath touched, who desire to join this great
          army? Have I one here who has been enlisted in the black army of the
          devil, and has long been fighting his way against God and against
          right? I pray that he may be compelled this day to ground his arms,
          and surrender at discretion to God. Sinner, if the Lord inclines thine
          heart this day to yield up thyself to him, the past shall all be
          blotted out; God shall be thy rereward. As for thy innumerable sins,
          leave them to Christ; he will make short work of them; by his blood he
          will slay them all; they shall not be mentioned against thee for ever.
          And as for the future, thou chief of sinners, if now thou enlistest
          into the army of Christ by faith, thou shalt find the future shall be
          strewn with the gold of God's grace, and the silver of his temporal
          mercies; thou shalt have enough and to spare, from this day forth even
          to the end, and at the last thou shalt be gathered in by the great
          arms of God, that constitute the rear guard of his heavenly army. Come
          ye chief of sinners, come away to Christ. He now invites you to come
          to him; he asks nothing of you as a preparation. Christ's regiment is
          made up of men that are in debt and are discontented: the rag-tag of
          the world Christ will take; the scum, the dross, the offal of the
          universe Christ loves; the sweepings of our dens of iniquity, the very
          leavings of the devil's mill Christ is willing to receive, the chief
          of sinners, those who have been ministers in guilt, abortions of
          iniquity. Come to him; lay hold of him by faith; look to him as he
          hangs upon the tree; believe in his merits, and then shalt this
          promise be yours with innumerable others that are rich beyond all
          estimation; and you shall rejoice that Jehovah is gone before you, and
          that the God of Israel shall be your rereward.<br />
