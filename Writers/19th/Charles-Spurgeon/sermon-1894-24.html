An Essay with a Sonnet</p><p></p><p> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; and remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement. Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for youth and the prime of life are vanity.</p><p> The Coming of the Evil Days</p><p> Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth:</p><p> Or ever the evil days come,<br/>And the years draw nigh,<br/>When thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them:</p><p> Or ever the sun.<br/>And the light,<br/>And the moon,<br/>And the stars,<br/>Be darkened,<br/>And the clouds return after the rain:<br/>In the days when the keepers of the house shall tremble, And the strong men shall bow themselves,<br/>And the grinders cease because they are few,<br/>And those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the street;</p><p> When the sound of the grinding is low,<br/>And one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,<br/>And all the daughters of music shall be brought low;</p><p> Yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high.<br/>And terrors shall be in the way;</p><p> And the almond tree shall blossom,<br/>And the grasshopper shall be a burden,<br/>And the caperberry shall burst:</p><p> Because man goeth to his long home,<br/>And the mourners go about the streets:</p><p> Or ever the silver cord be loosed,<br/>Or the golden bowl be broken,<br/>Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain,<br/>Or the wheel broken at the cistern:</p><p>And the dust return to the earth,<br/>As it was;<br/>And the spirit return unto God<br/>Who gave it.</p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
