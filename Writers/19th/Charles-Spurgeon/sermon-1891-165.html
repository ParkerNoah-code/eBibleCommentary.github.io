          1. In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to
          the Lord's disciples what shall happen in the last times, and
          concerning the ten kings who shall then arise, among whom the empire
          which now rules [the earth] shall be partitioned. He teaches us what
          the ten horns shall be which were seen by Daniel, telling us that thus
          it had been said to him: |And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten
          kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but shall receive power as
          if kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and give their
          strength and power to the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb,
          and the Lamb shall overcome them, because He is the Lord of lords and
          the King of kings.| It is manifest, therefore, that of these
          [potentates], he who is to come shall slay three, and subject the
          remainder to his power, and that he shall be himself the eighth among
          them. And they shall lay Babylon waste, and burn her with fire, and
          shall give their kingdom to the beast, and put the Church to flight.
          After that they shall be destroyed by the coming of our Lord. For that
          the kingdom must be divided, and thus come to ruin, the Lord [declares
          when He] says: |Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to
          desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not
          stand.| It must be, therefore, that the kingdom, the city, and the
          house be divided into ten; and for this reason He has already
          foreshadowed the partition and division [which shall take place].
          Daniel also says particularly, that the end of the fourth kingdom
          consists in the toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, upon which
          came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: |The
          feet were indeed the one part iron, the other part clay, until the
          stone was cut out without hands, and struck the image upon the iron
          and clay feet, and dashed them into pieces, even to the end.| Then
          afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: |And as thou sawest the
          feet and the toes, partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the
          kingdom shall be divided, and there shall be in it a root of iron, as
          thou sawest iron mixed with baked clay. And the toes were indeed the
          one part iron, but the other part clay.| The ten toes, therefore, are
          these ten kings, among whom the kingdom shall be partitioned, of whom
          some indeed shall be strong and active, or energetic; others, again,
          shall be sluggish and useless, and shall not agree; as also Daniel
          says: |Some part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be
          broken from it. As thou sawest the iron mixed with the baked clay,
          there shall be minglings among the human race, but no cohesion one
          with the other, just as iron cannot be welded on to pottery ware.| And
          since an end shall take place, he says: |And in the days of these
          kings shall the God of heaven raise up a kingdom which shall never
          decay, and His kingdom shall not be left to another people. It shall
          break in pieces and shatter all kingdoms, and shall itself be exalted
          for ever. As thou sawest that the stone was cut without hands from the
          mountain, and brake in pieces the baked clay, the iron, the brass, the
          silver, and the gold, God has pointed out to the king what shall come
          to pass after these things; and the dream is true, and the
          interpretation trustworthy.|

          2. If therefore the great God showed future things by Daniel, and
          confirmed them by His Son; and if Christ is the stone which is cut out
          without hands, who shall destroy temporal kingdoms, and introduce an
          eternal one, which is the resurrection of the just; as he declares,
          |The God of heaven shall raise up a kingdom which shall never be
          destroyed,| -- let those thus confuted come to their senses, who
          reject the Creator (Demiurgum), and do not agree that the prophets
          were sent beforehand from the same Father from whom also the Lord
          came, but who assert that prophecies originated from diverse powers.
          For those things which have been predicted by the Creator alike
          through all the prophets has Christ fulfilled in the end, ministering
          to His Father's will, and completing His dispensations with regard to
          the human race. Let those persons, therefore, who blaspheme the
          Creator, either by openly expressed words, such as the disciples of
          Marcion, or by a perversion of the sense [of Scripture], as those of
          Valentinus and all the Gnostics falsely so called, be recognised as
          agents of Satan by all those who worship God; through whose agency
          Satan now, and not before, has been seen to speak against God, even
          Him who has prepared eternal fire for every kind of apostasy. For he
          did not venture to blaspheme his Lord openly of himself; as also in
          the beginning he led man astray through the instrumentality of the
          serpent, concealing himself as it were from God. Truly has Justin
          remarked: That before the Lord's appearance Satan never dared to
          blaspheme God, inasmuch as he did not yet know his own sentence,
          because it was contained in parables and allegories; but that after
          the Lord's appearance, when he had clearly ascertained from the words
          of Christ and His apostles that eternal fire has been prepared for him
          as he apostatized from God of his own free-will, and likewise for all
          who unrepentant continue in the apostasy, he now blasphemes, by means
          of such men, the Lord who brings judgment [upon him] as being already
          condemned, and imputes the guilt of his apostasy to his Maker, not to
          his own voluntary disposition. Just as it is with those who break the
          laws, when punishment overtakes them: they throw the blame upon those
          who frame the laws, but not upon themselves. In like manner do those
          men, filled with a satanic spirit, bring innumerable accusations
          against our Creator, who has both given to us the spirit of life, and
          established a law adapted for all; and they will not admit that the
          judgment of God is just. Wherefore also they set about imagining some
          other Father who neither cares about nor exercises a providence over
          our affairs, nay, one who even approves of all sins.<br />
