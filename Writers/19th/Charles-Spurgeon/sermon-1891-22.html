          1. Besides the above [misrepresentations], they adduce an unspeakable
          number of apocryphal and spurious writings, which they themselves have
          forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish men, and of such as are
          ignorant of the Scriptures of truth. Among other things, they bring
          forward that false and wicked story which relates that our Lord, when
          He was a boy learning His letters, on the teacher saying to Him, as is
          usual, |Pronounce Alpha,| replied [as He was bid], |Alpha.| But when,
          again, the teacher bade Him say, |Beta,| the Lord replied, |Do thou
          first tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell thee what Beta is.|
          This they expound as meaning that He alone knew the Unknown, which He
          revealed under its type Alpha.

          2. Some passages, also, which occur in the Gospels, receive from them
          a colouring of the same kind, such as the answer which He gave His
          mother when He was twelve years of age: |Wist ye not that I must be
          about My Father's business?| Thus, they say, He announced to them the
          Father of whom they were ignorant. On this account, also, He sent
          forth the disciples to the twelve tribes, that they might proclaim to
          them the unknown God. And to the person who said to Him, |Good
          Master,| He confessed that God who is truly good, saying, |Why callest
          thou Me good: there is One who is good, the Father in the heavens;|
          and they assert that in this passage the Ã†ons receive the name of
          heavens. Moreover, by His not replying to those who said to Him, |By
          what power doest Thou this?| but by a question on His own side, put
          them to utter confusion; by His thus not replying, according to their
          interpretation, He showed the unutterable nature of the Father.
          Moreover, when He said, |I have often desired to hear one of these
          words, and I had no one who could utter it,| they maintain, that by
          this expression |one| He set forth the one true God whom they knew
          not. Further, when, as He drew nigh to Jerusalem, He wept over it and
          said, |If thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things
          that belong unto thy peace, but they are hidden from thee,| by this
          word |hidden| He showed the abstruse nature of Bythus. And again, when
          He said, |Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
          will give you rest, and learn of Me,| He announced the Father of
          truth. For what they knew not, these men say that He promised to teach
          them.

          3. But they adduce the following passage as the highest testimony,
          and, as it were, the very crown of their system: -- |I thank Thee, O
          Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things
          from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. Even so,
          my Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight. All things have been
          delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knoweth the Father but the
          Son, or the Son but the Father, and he to whom the Son will reveal
          Him.| In these words they affirm that He clearly showed that the
          Father of truth, conjured into existence by them, was known to no one
          before His advent. And they desire to construe the passage as if
          teaching that the Maker and Framer [of the world] was always known by
          all, while the Lord spoke these words concerning the Father unknown to
          all, whom they now proclaim.<br />
