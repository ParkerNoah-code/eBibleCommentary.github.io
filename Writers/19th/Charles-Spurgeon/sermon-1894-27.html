          Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;<br />And the years of thy life
          shall be many.<br />I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;<br />I
          have led thee in paths of uprightness.<br />When thou goest, thy steps
          shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not
          stumble.<br />Take fast hold of instruction;<br />Let her not go:<br />Keep
          her;<br />For she is thy life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter not into the path of the wicked,<br />And walk not in the way of
          evil men.<br />Avoid it,<br />Pass not by it;<br />Turn from it,<br />And
          pass on.<br />For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; And
          their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. For they
          eat the bread of wickedness,<br />And drink the wine of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, That shineth
          more and more unto the perfect day.<br />The way of the wicked is as
          darkness:<br />They know not at what they stumble.
