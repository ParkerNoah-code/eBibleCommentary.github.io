          1. Since, therefore, the tradition from the apostles does thus exist
          in the Church, and is permanent among us, let us revert to the
          Scriptural proof furnished by those apostles who did also write the
          Gospel, in which they recorded the doctrine regarding God, pointing
          out that our Lord Jesus Christ is the truth, and that no lie is in
          Him. As also David says, prophesying His birth from a virgin, and the
          resurrection from the dead, |Truth has sprung out of the earth.| The
          apostles, likewise, being disciples of the truth, are above all
          falsehood; for a lie has no fellowship with the truth, just as
          darkness has none with light, but the presence of the one shuts out
          that of the other. Our Lord, therefore, being the truth, did not speak
          lies; and whom He knew to have taken origin from a defect, He never
          would have acknowledged as God, even the God of all, the Supreme King,
          too, and His own Father, an imperfect being as a perfect one, an
          animal one as a spiritual, Him who was without the Pleroma as Him who
          was within it. Neither did His disciples make mention of any other
          God, or term any other Lord, except Him, who was truly the God and
          Lord of all, as these most vain sophists affirm that the apostles did
          with hypocrisy frame their doctrine according to the capacity of their
          hearers, and gave answers after the opinions of their questioners, --
          fabling blind things for the blind, according to their blindness; for
          the dull according to their dulness; for those in error according to
          their error. And to those who imagined that the Demiurge alone was
          God, they preached him; but to those who are capable of comprehending
          the unnameable Father, they did declare the unspeakable mystery
          through parables and enigmas: so that the Lord and the apostles
          exercised the office of teacher not to further the cause of truth, but
          even in hypocrisy, and as each individual was able to receive it!

          2. Such [a line of conduct] belongs not to those who heal, or who give
          life: it is rather that of those bringing on diseases, and increasing
          ignorance; and much more true than these men shall the law be found,
          which pronounces every one accursed who sends the blind man astray in
          the way. For the apostles, who were commissioned to find out the
          wanderers, and to be for sight to those who saw not, and medicine to
          the weak, certainly did not address them in accordance with their
          opinion at the time, but according to revealed truth. For no persons
          of any kind would act properly, if they should advise blind men, just
          about to fall over a precipice, to continue their most dangerous path,
          as if it were the right one, and as if they might go on in safety. Or
          what medical man, anxious to heal a sick person, would prescribe in
          accordance with the patient's whims, and not according to the
          requisite medicine? But that the Lord came as the physician of the
          sick, He does Himself declare saying, |They that are whole need not a
          physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous,
          but sinners to repentance.| How then shall the sick be strengthened,
          or how shall sinners come to repentance? Is it by persevering in the
          very same courses? or, on the contrary, is it by undergoing a great
          change and reversal of their former mode of living, by which they have
          brought upon themselves no slight amount of sickness, and many sins?
          But ignorance, the mother of all these, is driven out by knowledge.
          Wherefore the Lord used to impart knowledge to His disciples, by which
          also it was His practice to heal those who were suffering, and to keep
          back sinners from sin. He therefore did not address them in accordance
          with their pristine notions, nor did He reply to them in harmony with
          the opinion of His questioners, but according to the doctrine leading
          to salvation, without hypocrisy or respect of person.

          3. This is also made clear from the words of the Lord, who did truly
          reveal the Son of God to those of the circumcision -- Him who had been
          foretold as Christ by the prophets; that is, He set Himself forth, who
          had restored liberty to men, and bestowed on them the inheritance of
          incorruption. And again, the apostles taught the Gentiles that they
          should leave vain stocks and stones, which they imagined to be gods,
          and worship the true God, who had created and made all the human
          family, and, by means of His creation, did nourish, increase,
          strengthen, and preserve them in being; and that they might look for
          His Son Jesus Christ, who redeemed us from apostasy with His own
          blood, so that we should also be a sanctified people, -- who shall
          also descend from heaven in His Father's power, and pass judgment upon
          all, and who shall freely give the good things of God to those who
          shall have kept His commandments. He, appearing in these last times,
          the chief cornerstone, has gathered into one, and united those that
          were far off and those that were near; that is, the circumcision and
          the uncircumcision, enlarging Japhet, and placing him in the dwelling
          of Shem. <br />
