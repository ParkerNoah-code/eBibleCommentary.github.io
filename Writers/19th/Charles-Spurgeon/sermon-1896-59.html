          31. Glory be to Jehovah for ever; let Jehovah rejoice in his works.32.
          When he looketh upon the earth, it shall tremble: if he touch the
          mountains, they shall smoke. 33. I will sing to Jehovah whilst I live:
          I will sing psalms to my God as long as I have my being. 34. Let my
          speech [or words ] be acceptable to him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.35.
          Let sinners perish from the earth, and the wicked till they cease to
          be any more. O my soul! bless thou Jehovah. Hallelujah.

          31. Glory be to Jehovah for ever The inspired writer shows for what
          purpose he has celebrated in the preceding part of the psalm the
          power, wisdom, and goodness of God in his works, namely, to stir up
          men to praise him. It is no small honor that God for our sake has so
          magnificently adorned the world, in order that we may not only be
          spectators of this beauteous theater, but also enjoy the multiplied
          abundance and variety of good things which are presented to us in it.
          Our gratitude in yielding to God the praise which is his due, is
          regarded by him as a singular recompense. What the Psalmist adds, Let
          Jehovah rejoice in his works, is not superfluous; for he desires that
          the order which God has established from the beginning may be
          continued in the lawful use of his gifts. As we read in Genesis 6:6,
          that |it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,| so when
          he sees that the good things which he bestows are polluted by our
          corruptions, he ceases to take delight in bestowing them. And
          certainly the confusion and disorder which take place, when the
          elements cease to perform their office, testify that God, displeased
          and wearied out, is provoked to discontinue, and put a stop to the
          regular course of his beneficence; although anger and impatience have
          strictly speaking no place in his mind. What is here taught is, that
          he bears the character of the best of fathers, who takes pleasure in
          tenderly cherishing his children, and in bountifully nourishing them.
          In the following verse it is shown, that the stability of the world
          depends on this rejoicing of God in his works; for did he not give
          vigor to the earth by his gracious and fatherly regard, as soon as he
          looked upon it with a severe countenance, he would make it tremble,
          and would burn up the very mountains.

          33. I will sing to Jehovah whilst I live Here the Psalmist points out
          to others their duty by his own example, declaring, that throughout
          the whole course of his life he will proclaim the praises of God
          without ever growing weary of that exercise. The only boundary which
          he fixes to the celebration of God's praises is death; not that the
          saints, when they pass from this world into another state of
          existence, desist from this religious duty, but because the end for
          which we are created is, that the divine name may be celebrated by us
          on the earth. Conscious of his unworthiness to offer to God so
          precious a sacrifice, he humbly prays, (verse 34,) that the praises
          which he will sing to God may be acceptable to him, although they
          proceed from polluted lips. It is true, that there is nothing more
          acceptable to God, nor any thing of which he more approves, than the
          publication of his praises, even as there is no service which he more
          peculiarly requires us to perform. But as our uncleanness defiles that
          which in its own nature is most holy, the prophet with good reason
          betakes himself to the goodness of God, and on this ground alone
          pleads that He would accept of his song of praise. Accordingly, the
          Apostle, in Hebrews 13:15 teaches that our sacrifices of thanksgiving
          are well pleasing to God, when they are offered to him through Christ.
          It being however the case, that whilst all men indiscriminately enjoy
          the benefits of God, there are yet very few who look to the author of
          them, the prophet subjoins the clause, I will rejoice in the Lord;
          intimating, that this is a rare virtue; for nothing is more difficult
          than to call home the mind from those wild and erratic joys, which
          disperse themselves through heaven and earth in which they evanish,
          that it may keep itself fixed on God alone.

          35. Let sinners perish from the earth This imprecation depends on the
          last clause of the 31st verse, Let Jehovah rejoice in his works As the
          wicked infect the world with their pollutions, the consequence is,
          that God has less delight in his own workmanship, and is even almost
          displeased with it. It is impossible, but that this uncleanness,
          which, being extended and diffused through every part of the world,
          vitiates and corrupts such a noble product of his hands, must be
          offensive to him. Since then the wicked, by their perverse abuse of
          God's gifts, cause the world in a manner to degenerate and fall away
          from its first original, the prophet justly desires that they may be
          exterminated, until the race of them entirely fail. Let us then take
          care so to weigh the providence of God, as that being wholly devoted
          to obeying him, we may rightly and purely use the benefits which he
          sanctities for our enjoying them. Farther, let us be grieved, that
          such precious treasures are wickedly squandered away, and let us
          regard it as monstrous and detestable, that men not only forget their
          Maker, but also, as it were, purposely turn to a perverse and an
          unworthy end, whatever good things he has bestowed upon them.<br />
