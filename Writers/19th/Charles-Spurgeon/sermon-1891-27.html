          1. Carpocrates, again, and his followers maintain that the world and
          the things which are therein were created by angels greatly inferior
          to the unbegotten Father. They also hold that Jesus was the son of
          Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he
          differed from them in this respect, that inasmuch as his soul was
          stedfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those things which he had
          witnessed within the sphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a
          power descended upon him from the Father, that by means of it he might
          escape from the creators of the world; and they say that it, after
          passing through them all, and remaining in all points free, ascended
          again to him, and to the powers, which in the same way embraced like
          things to itself. They further declare, that the soul of Jesus,
          although educated in the practices of the Jews, regarded these with
          contempt, and that for this reason he was endowed with faculties, by
          means of which he destroyed those passions which dwelt in men as a
          punishment [for their sins].
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ can despise those
          rulers who were the creators of the world, and, in like manner,
          receives power for accomplishing the same results. This idea has
          raised them to such a pitch of pride, that some of them declare
          themselves similar to Jesus; while others, still more mighty, maintain
          that they are superior to his disciples, such as Peter and Paul, and
          the rest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no respect
          inferior to Jesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as
          his, and therefore despising in like manner the creators of the world,
          are deemed worthy of the same power, and again depart to the same
          place. But if any one shall have despised the things in this world
          more than he did, he thus proves himself superior to him.
        </p>

          3. They practise also magical arts and incantations; philters, also,
          and love-potions; and have recourse to familiar spirits, dream-sending
          demons, and other abominations, declaring that they possess power to
          rule over, even now, the princes and formers of this world; and not
          only them, but also all things that are in it. These men, even as the
          Gentiles, have been sent forth by Satan to bring dishonour upon the
          Church, so that, in one way or another, men hearing the things which
          they speak, and imagining that we all are such as they, may turn away
          their ears from the preaching of the truth; or, again, seeing the
          things they practise, may speak evil of us all, who have in fact no
          fellowship with them, either in doctrine or in morals, or in our daily
          conduct. But they lead a licentious life, and, to conceal their
          impious doctrines, they abuse the name [of Christ], as a means of
          hiding their wickedness; so that |their condemnation is just,| when
          they receive from God a recompense suited to their works.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. So unbridled is their madness, that they declare they have in their
          power all things which are irreligious and impious, and are at liberty
          to practise them; for they maintain that things are evil or good,
          simply in virtue of human opinion. They deem it necessary, therefore,
          that by means of transmigration from body to body, souls should have
          experience of every kind of life as well as every kind of action
          (unless, indeed, by a single incarnation, one may be able to prevent
          any need for others, by once for all, and with equal completeness,
          doing all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of, nay,
          which we must not even conceive in our thoughts, nor think credible,
          if any such thing is mooted among those persons who are our
          fellow-citizens), in order that, as their writings express it, their
          souls, having made trial of every kind of life, may, at their
          departure, not be wanting in any particular. It is necessary to insist
          upon this, lest, on account of some one thing being still wanting to
          their deliverance, they should be compelled once more to become
          incarnate. They affirm that for this reason Jesus spoke the following
          parable: -- |Whilst thou art with thine adversary in the way, give all
          diligence, that thou mayest be delivered from him, lest he give thee
          up to the judge, and the judge surrender thee to the officer, and he
          cast thee into prison. Verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not go out
          thence until thou pay the very last farthing.| They also declare the
          |adversary| is one of those angels who are in the world, whom they
          call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that
          he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the
          Supreme Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers
          of the world, and maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been
          mentioned] to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut
          them up in other bodies; for they declare that the body is |the
          prison.| Again, they interpret these expressions, |Thou shalt not go
          out thence until thou pay the very last farthing,| as meaning that no
          one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but
          that he must pass from body to body, until he has experience of every
          kind of action which can be practised in this world, and when nothing
          is longer wanting to him, then his liberated soul should soar upwards
          to that God who is above the angels, the makers of the world. In this
          way also all souls are saved, whether their own which, guarding
          against all delay, participate in all sorts of actions during one
          incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from body to body, are
          set free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every
          form of life into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no
          longer be [shut up] in the body.

          5. And thus, if ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden actions are committed
          among them, I can no longer find ground for believing them to be such.
          And in their writings we read as follows, the interpretation which
          they give [of their views], declaring that Jesus spoke in a mystery to
          His disciples and apostles privately, and that they requested and
          obtained permission to hand down the things thus taught them, to
          others who should be worthy and believing. We are saved, indeed, by
          means of faith and love; but all other things, while in their nature
          indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men -- some good and some
          evil, there being nothing really evil by nature.

          6. Others of them employ outward marks, branding their disciples
          inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose
          Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] Anicetus, and,
          holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style
          themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted,
          and others formed from different kinds of material; while they
          maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time
          when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up
          along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say,
          with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest.
          They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same
          manner of the Gentiles.<br />
