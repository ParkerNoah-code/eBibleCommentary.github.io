          |Therefore let us not sleep, as do others: but let us watch and be
          sober.| -- 1 Thess.5:6
        </p>
        <p>
          As the spiritual guide of the flock of God along the intricate mazes
          of experience, it is the duty of the gospel minister to point out
          every turning of the road to heaven, to speak concerning its dangers
          or its privileges, and to warn any whom he may suspect to be in a
          position peculiarly perilous. Now, there is a portion of the road
          which leadeth from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City,
          which has in it, perhaps, more dangers than any other portion of the
          way. It doth not abound with lions; there are no dragons in it; it
          hath no dark woods, and no deep pitfalls; yet more seeming pilgrims
          have been destroyed in that portion of the road than anywhere else,
          and not even Doubting Castle, with all its host of bones, can show so
          many who have been slain there. It is the part of the road called the
          Enchanted Ground. The great geographer, John Bunyan, well pictured it
          when he said:
        </p>
        <p>
          |I then saw in my dream that they went on till they came into a
          certain country, whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy, if he
          came a stranger into it. And here Hopeful began to be very dull, and
          heavy of sleep; wherefore he said unto Christian, I do now begin to
          grow so drowsy that I can scarcely hold up mine eyes; let us lie down
          here, and take one nap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian: |By no means, said the other, lest sleeping we never awake
          more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopeful: |Why, my brother? Sleep is sweet to the laboring man; we may
          be refreshed if we take a nap.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian: |Do you not remember that one of the shepherds bid us
          beware of the Enchanted Ground? He meant by that, that we should
          beware of sleeping; wherefore, let us not sleep as others do, but let
          us watch and be sober.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no doubt, many of us, beloved, who are passing over this
          plain; and I fear that this is the condition of the majority of
          churches in the present day. They are lying down on the settles of
          Lukewarmness, in the Arbors of the Enchanted Ground. There is not that
          activity and zeal we could wish to see among them; they are not,
          perhaps, notably heterodox; they may not be invaded by the lion of
          persecution, but they are somewhat worse than that, -- they are lying
          down to slumber, like Heedless and Too-Bold in the Arbor of Sloth. May
          God grant that his servants may be the means of arousing the church
          from its lethargy, and stirring it up from its slumbers, lest haply
          professors should sleep the sleep of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I intend to show you what is meant by the state of sleep
          into which Christians sometimes fall; secondly, I shall use some
          considerations, if possible, to wake up such as are slumbering;
          thirdly, I shall mark sundry times when the Christian is most liable
          to fall asleep; and shall conclude by giving you some advice as to the
          mode in which you should conduct yourselves when you are passing over
          the Enchanted Ground, and feel drowsiness weighing down your eyelids.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, what is that state of sleep into which the Christian man may
          fall? It is not death. He was dead once, but he is now alive in Christ
          Jesus; and therefore shall never die; but though a living man shall
          never die, being quickened by an immortal life, yet that living man
          may sleep; and that sleep is so nearly akin to death that I have known
          slumbering Christians mistaken for dead, carnal sinners. Come,
          beloved, let me picture to you the state of the Christian while he is
          in a condition of sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, sleep is a state of insensibility; and such is that state which
          too often falls upon even the best children of God. When a man is
          asleep he is insensible. The world goes on, and he knows naught about
          it. The watchman calls beneath his window, and he sleeps on still. A
          fire is in a neighboring street, his neighbor's house is burned to
          ashes, but he is asleep, and knows it not. Persons are sick in the
          house, but he is not awakened; they may die, and he weeps not for
          them. A revolution may be raging in the streets of his city; a king
          may be losing his crown; but he that is asleep shares not in the
          turmoil of politics. A volcano may burst somewhere near him, and he
          may be in imminent peril; but he escapeth not; he is sound asleep, he
          is insensible. The winds are howling, the thunders are rolling across
          the sky, and the lightnings flash at his window; but he that can sleep
          on careth not for these, and is insensible to them all. The sweetest
          music is passing through the street; but he sleeps, and only in dreams
          doth he hear the sweetness. The most terrific wailings may assail his
          ears; but sleep has sealed them with the wax of slumber, and he hears
          not. Let the world break in sunder, and the elements go to ruin, keep
          him asleep, and he will not perceive it. Christian, behold your
          condition. Have you not sometimes been brought into a condition of
          insensibility? You wished you could feel; but all you felt was pain
          because you could not feel. You wished you could pray. It was not that
          you felt prayerless, but it was because you did not feel at all. You
          sighed once; you would give a world if you could sigh now. You used to
          groan once; a groan now would be worth a golden star if you could buy
          it. As for songs, you can sing them, but then your heart does not go
          with them. You go to the house of God; but when |the multitude that
          keep holy day| in the full tide of song send their music up to heaven,
          you hear it, but your heart does not leap at the sound. Prayer goeth
          solemnly like the evening sacrifice up to God's throne; once you could
          pray, too; but now, while your body is in the house of God, your heart
          is not there. You feel you have brought the chrysalis of your being;
          but the fly is gone away from it; it is a dead, lifeless case. You
          have become like a formalist; you feel that there is not savor, that
          unction, in the preaching that there used to be. There is no
          difference in your minister, you know; the change is in yourself. The
          hymns and the prayers are just the same, but you have fallen into a
          state of slumber. Once, if you thought of a man's being damned, you
          would weep your very soul out in tears; but now you could sit at the
          very brink of hell, and hear its wailings unmoved. Once the thought of
          restoring a sinner from the error of his ways would have made you
          start from your bed at midnight, and you would have rushed through the
          cold air to help rescue a sinner from his sins. Now, talk to you about
          perishing multitudes, and you hear it as an old, old tale. Tell you of
          thousands swept by the mighty flood of sin onwards to the precipice of
          destruction, you express your regret, you give your contribution, but
          your heart goeth not with it. You must confess that you are
          insensible. -- not entirely, but too much so. You want to be awake:
          but you groan because you feel yourselves to be in this state of
          slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, he that sleepeth is subject to divers illusions. When we
          sleep, judgment goeth from us, and fancy holdeth carnival within our
          brain. When we sleep, dreams arise and fashion in our head strange
          things. Sometimes we are tossed on the stormy deep, and anon we revel
          in king's palaces. We gather up gold and silver as if they were but
          the pebbles of the sea; and anon we are poor and naked, shivering in
          the blast. What illusions deceive us! The beggar in his dream becomes
          richer than Plautus, and the rich man as poor as Lazarus: the sick man
          is well, the healthy man hath lost his limbs, or is dead. Yea, dreams
          do make us descend to hell, or even carry us to heaven. Christian, if
          thou art one of the sleepy brotherhood, thou art subject to divers
          illusions. Strange thoughts come to thee which thou never hadst
          before. Sometimes thou doubtest if there be a God, or if thou dost
          exist thyself. Thou tremblest lest the gospel should not be true, and
          the old doctrine which once thou didst hold with a stern hand, thou
          art almost inclined to let go. Vile heresies assail thee. Thou
          thinkest that the Lord that bought thee was not the Son of God. The
          devil tells thee that thou art none of the Lord's, and thou dreamest
          that thou art cast away from the love of the covenant. Thou criest
        </p>
        <p>|I would, but cannot sing;</p>
        <p>I would, but cannot pray;|</p>
        <p>
          and thou feelest as if it were all in question whether thou art one of
          the Lord's or no. Or perhaps thy dreams are brighter, and thou
          dreamest that thou art somebody, great and mighty, a special favorite
          of Heaven; pride puffs thee up; thou dreamest that thou art rich, and
          hast need of nothing, whilst thou art naked, poor, and miserable. Is
          this thy state, O Christian? If so, may God wake thee up from it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, sleep is a state of inaction. No daily bread is earned by him
          that sleepeth. The man who is stretched upon his couch neither writeth
          books, nor tilleth the ground, nor plougheth the sea, nor doth aught
          else. His hands hang down, his pulse beateth, and life there is, but
          he is positively dead as to activity. O beloved, here is the state of
          many of you. How many Christians are inactive! Once it was their
          delight to instruct the young in the Sabbath- school, but that is now
          given up. Once they attended the early prayer-meeting, but not now.
          Once they would be hewers of wood and drawers of water, but alas! they
          are asleep now. Am I talking of what may happen! Is it not too true
          almost universally? Are not the churches asleep? Where are the
          ministers that preach? We have men that read the manuscripts, and talk
          essays: but is that preaching? We have men that can amuse an audience
          for twenty minutes. Is that preaching? Where are the men that preach
          their hearts out, and say their soul in every sentence? Where are the
          men that make it, not a profession, but a vocation, the breath of
          their bodies, the marrow of their bones, the delight of their spirits?
          Where are the Whitefields and Wesleys now? Are they not gone, gone,
          gone? Where are the Rowland Hills now, who preached every day, and
          three times a day, and were not afraid of preaching everywhere the
          unsearchable riches of Christ? Brethren, the Church slumbers. It is
          not merely that the pulpit is a sentry-box with the sentinel fast
          asleep; but the pews are affected. How are the prayer-meetings almost
          universally neglected! Our own church stands out like an almost
          solitary green islet in the midst of a dark, dark, sea; one bright
          pearl in the depths of an ocean of discord and confusion. Look at
          neighboring churches. Step into the vestry, and see a smaller band of
          people than you would like to think of, assembled round the pastor,
          whose heart is dull and heavy. Hear one brother after another pour out
          the dull monotonous prayer that he has said by heart these fifty
          years; and then go away and say: |Where is the spirit of prayer, where
          the life of devotion?| Is it not almost extinct? Are not our churches
          |fallen, fallen, fallen from their high estate?| God wake them up, and
          send them more earnest and praying men!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. The man who is asleep is in a state of insecurity. The
          murderer smiteth him that sleeps: the midnight robber plundereth his
          house that resteth listlessly on his pillow. Jael smiteth a sleeping
          Sisera. Abner taketh away the spear from the bolster of a slumbering
          Saul A sleeping Eutychus falleth from the third loft, and is taken up
          dead. A sleeping Samson is shorn of his locks, and the Philistines are
          upon him. Sleeping men are ever in danger; they cannot ward off the
          blow of the enemy, or strike another. Christian, if thou art sleeping,
          thou art in danger. Thy life, I know, can never be taken from thee;
          that is hid with Christ in God. But O! thou mayest lose thy spear from
          thy bolster; thou mayest lose much of thy faith; and thy cruse of
          water, wherewith thou dost moisten thy lips, may be stolen by the
          prowling thief. O! thou little knowest thy danger. Even now the
          black-winged angel takes his spear, and standing at thy head, he says
          to Jesus (to David), |Shall I smite him? I will smite him but once.|
          (David says) Our Jesus whispers, |Thou shalt not smite him. Take his
          spear and his cruse, but thou shalt not kill him.| But O! awake, thou
          slumber! Start up from the place where thou now liest in thy
          insecurity! This is not the sleep of Jacob, in which ladders unite
          heaven and earth, and angels tread their ascending rounds; but this is
          the sleep where ladders are raised from hell, and devils climb upward
          from the pit to molest thy spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings me to the second point, Some considerations to wake up
          sleepy Christians. I remember, once in my life, having a sleepy
          congregation. They had been eating too much dinner, and they came to
          the chapel in the afternoon very sleepy, so I tried an old expedient
          to rouse them. I shouted with all my might, |Fire! fire! fire!| when,
          starting from their seats, some of the congregation asked where it
          was; and I told them it was in hell, for such sleepy sinners as they
          were. So, beloved, I might cry |Fire! fire!| this morning, to waken
          sleepy Christians; but that would be a false cry, because the fire of
          hell was never made for Christians at all, and they need never tremble
          at it. The honor of God is engaged to save the meanest sheep; and
          whether that sheep is asleep or awake, it is perfectly safe, so far as
          final salvation is concerned. There are better reasons why I should
          stir up a Christian, and I shall use a very few of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, O Christian! awake from thy slumber, because thy Lord is
          coming. That is the grand reason used in the text. The apostle says,
          |Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.|
          |Yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
          thief in the night.| |Ye brethren, are not in darkness, that that day
          should overtake you as a thief.| O Christians! do you know that your
          Lord is coming? In such an hour as ye think not, the man who once hung
          quivering on Calvary will descend in glory; |The head that once was
          crowned with thorns| will soon be crowned with a diadem of brilliant
          jewels. He will come in the clouds of heaven to his church. Would you
          wish to be sleeping when your Lord comes? Do you want to be like the
          foolish virgins, or like the wise ones, either, who, while the
          bridegroom tarried, slumbered and slept? If our Master were to appear
          this morning, are there not half of us in such a state that we should
          be afraid to see him? Why, you know, when a friend comes to your
          house, if he is some great man, what brushing and dusting there is.
          Every corner of the room has its cobwebs removed; every carpet is
          turned up; and you make every effort to have the house clean for his
          coming. What! and will you have your house dusty, and the spiders of
          neglect building the cobwebs of indolence in the corners of your
          house, when your Lord may arrive tomorrow? And if we are to have an
          audience with the Queen, what dressing there is! How careful will men
          be that everything should be put on aright, that they should appear
          properly in court dress! Do you not know, servant of the Lord, that
          you are to appear before the king in his beauty, and to see him soon
          on earth? What! will ye be asleep when he comes? When he knocks at the
          door, shall he have for an answer, |The good man is asleep; he did not
          expect you|? Oh, no; be ye like men who watch for their Lord, that at
          his coming he may find you ready. Ah! ye carnal professors, who attend
          plays and balls, would you like Christ to come and find you in the
          middle of your dance? would you like him to look you in the face in
          the opera? Ah! ye carnal tradesmen, ye can cheat, and then pray after
          it. Would you like Christ to find you cheating? Ye devour widows'
          houses, and for a show make long prayers. You would not mind him
          coming in the middle of your long prayer; but he will come just at
          that poor widow's house is sticking in your throat, just as you are
          swallowing the lands of the poor oppressed on, and putting in your
          pocket the wages of which you have defrauded the labourer. Then he
          will come; and how terrible will he be to such as you! We have heard
          of the sailor, who, when his ship was sinking, rushed to the cabin to
          steal a bag of gold, and though warned that he could no swim with it,
          tied it about his loins, leaped into the sea with it, and sank to rise
          no more. And I am afraid there be some rich men who know not how to
          use their money, who will sink to hell, strangled by their gold,
          hanging like millstones round their necks. O Christian, it shall not b
          so with you; but wake from thy slumbers, for thy Lord cometh.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, Christian, thou art benevolent; thou lovest men's souls,
          and I will speak to thee of that which will touch thy heart. Wilt thou
          sleep while souls are being lost? A brother here, some time ago,
          rushed into a house which was burning, and he saved a person from it;
          he then returned to his wife, and what did she say to him? |Go back
          again, my husband, and see if you cannot save another. We will not
          rest till all are delivered.| Methinks that this is what the Christian
          man would say: |If I have been the means of saving one soul, I will
          not rest until I have saved another.| Oh, hast thou ever thought how
          many souls sink into hell every hour? Did the dreary thought that the
          death-knell of a soul is tolled by every tick of yonder clock, ever
          strike thee? Hast thou never thought that myriads of thy fellow
          creatures are in hell now, and that myriads more are hastening
          thither? and yet dost thou sleep? What! physician, wilt thou sleep
          while men are dying? Sailor, wilt thou sleep when the wreck is out at
          sea, and the life- boat is waiting for hands to man it! Christian,
          wilt thou tarry while souls are being lost? I do not say that thou
          canst save them -- God alone can do that -- but thou mayest be the
          instrument; and wouldst thou lose the opportunity of winning another
          jewel for thy crown in heaven? wouldst thou sleep while work is being
          done? Well, said the British king, at the battle of Agincourt, |Come
          on, and conquer.|
        </p>
        <p>And gentlemen in England -- now a-bed,</p>
        <p>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here:</p>
        <p>And hold their manhood cheap, when any speaks</p>
        <p>That fought with us upon this glorious day.|</p>
        <p>
          So methinks, when souls are being saved, Christians in bed may think
          themselves accursed they are not here. Sleep Christian, let me shout
          in thine ears -- thou art sleeping while souls are being lost --
          sleeping while men are being damned -- sleeping while hell is being
          peopled -- sleeping while Christ is being dishonored -- sleeping while
          the devil is grinning at thy sleepy face -- sleeping while demons are
          dancing around thy slumbering carcase, and telling it in hell that a
          Christian is asleep. You will never catch the devil asleep; let not
          the devil catch you asleep. Watch, and be sober, that ye may be always
          up to do your duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no time to use other considerations, though the subject is
          large enough, and I should have no difficulty in finding sticks enough
          to beat a sleeping dog with. |Let us not sleep as do others.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now it may be asked, When is the Christian most liable to sleep?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I answer, he is most liable to sleep when his temporal
          circumstances are all right. When your nest is well feathered you are
          then most likely to sleep; there is little danger of your sleeping
          when there is a bramble-bush in the bed. When all is downy, then the
          most likely thing will be that thou wilt say, |Soul, soul, thou hast
          much goods laid up for many years; take thy rest, eat, drink, and be
          merry.| Let me ask some of you, when you were more straightened in
          circumstances, when you had to rely upon providence each hour and had
          troubles to take to the throne of grace, were you not more wakeful
          than you are now? The miller who hath his wheel turned by a constant
          stream goes too sleep; but he that attendeth on the wind, which
          sometimes bloweth hard and sometimes gently, sleeps not, lest haply
          the full gust might rend the sails or there should not be enough to
          make them go round. Those who live by the day often sleep not by day,
          but they sleep in the night, -- the sleep of the beloved. Easy roads
          tend to make us slumber. Few sleep in a storm; many sleep on a calm
          night. He is a brave boy, indeed, who can have his eyes sealed when
          |upon the high and giddy mast, in bosom of the rude imperious surge;|
          but he is no wonder who sleepeth when there is no danger. Why is the
          church asleep now? She would not sleep if Smithfield were filled with
          stakes, if Bartholomew's tocsin were ringing in her ears; she would
          not sleep if Sicilian Vespers might be sung tomorrow's eve; she would
          not sleep if massacres were common now. But what is her condition?
          Every man sitting under his own vine and his own fig tree, none daring
          to make him afraid. Tread softly! she is fast asleep. Wake up, church!
          or else we will cut down the fig tree about thine ears. Start up! for
          the figs are ripe, they hang into thy sleepy mouth, and thou art too
          lazy to bite them off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now another dangerous time is when all goes well in spiritual matters.
          You never read that Christian went to sleep when lions were in the
          way; he never slept when he was going through the river Death, or when
          he was in Giant Despair's castle, or when he was fighting with
          Apollyon. Poor creature! he almost wished he could sleep then. But
          when he got halfway up the Hill Difficulty, and came to a pretty
          little arbor, in he went, and sat down and began to read his roll. O,
          how he rested himself! How he unstraped his sandals and rubbed his
          weary feet! Very soon his mouth was open, his arms hung down, and he
          was fast asleep. Again, the enchanted ground was a very easy, smooth
          place, and liable to send the pilgrim to sleep. You remember Bunyan's
          description of some of the arbors: |Then they came to an arbor, warm,
          and promising much refreshing to the weary pilgrims; for it was finely
          wrought above head, beautified with greens, and furnished with benches
          and settles. It had also in it a soft couch, where the weary might
          lean.| |The arbor was called the Slothful's Friend, and was made on
          purpose to allure, if it might be, some of the pilgrims to take up
          their rest there when weary.| Depend upon it, it is in easy places
          that men shut their eyes and wander into the dreamy land of
          forgetfulness. Old Erskine said a good thing when he remarked, |I like
          a roaring devil better than a sleeping devil.| There is no temptation
          half so bad as not being tempted. The distressed soul does not sleep;
          it is after we get into confidence and full assurance that we are in
          danger of slumbering. Take care, thou who art full of gladness. There
          is no season in which we are so likely to fall asleep as that of high
          enjoyment. The disciples went to sleep after they had seen Christ
          transfigured on the mountain-top. Take heed, joyous Christian, good
          frames are very dangerous; they often lull you into a sound sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet there is one more thing; and, if I ever were afraid of anything, I
          should fear to speck before my grave and reverend fathers in the faith
          the fact that one of the most likely places for us to sleep in is when
          we get near our journey's end. It is ill for a child to say that, and
          I will therefore back it up by the words of that great pilot John
          Bunyan: |For this enchanted ground is one of the last refuges that the
          enemy to pilgrims has; wherefore it is, as you see, placed almost at
          the end of the way, and so it standeth against us with the more
          advantage. For when, thinks the enemy, will these fools be so desirous
          to sit down as when they are weary? and when so like to be weary as
          when almost at their journey's end? Therefore it is, I say, that the
          enchanted ground is placed so nigh to the land Beulah, and so near the
          end of their race. Wherefore let pilgrims look to themselves, lest it
          happen to them as it has done to these that, as you see, are fallen
          asleep, and none can awake them.| May a child speck to those who are
          far before him in years and experience? But I am not a child when I
          preach. In the pulpit we stand as ambassadors of God, and God knoweth
          nothing of childhood or age; he teacheth whom he willeth, and speaketh
          as he pleases. It is true, my brethren, that those who have been years
          in grace are most in danger of slumbering. Somehow we get into the
          routine of the thing; it is usual for us to go to the house of God; it
          is usual for us to belong to the church, and that of itself tends to
          make people sleepy. Go into some of your churches in London, and you
          will hear a most delicious sermon preached to a people all sound
          asleep. The reason is that the service is all alike; they know when
          they have got to the third |Our Father which art in heaven.| when they
          have passed the confession general, and when they have got to the
          sermon, -- which is the time to sleep for twenty minutes. If the
          minister should smite his fist ecclesiastic upon the Bible, or enliven
          his faculties with a pinch of snuff, or even use his pocket
          handkerchief, the people would wake up, because it would be something
          out of the usual course. Or if he uttered an odd sentiment, they might
          be aroused, and would probably think that he had broken the 59th
          commandment, in making some of the congregation smile. But he never
          violates decorum; he stands, the very mirror of modesty and the
          picture of everything that is orderly. I have digressed, but you will
          see what I mean. If we are always going on the same road we are liable
          to sleep. If Moab gets at ease, and is not emptied from vessel to
          vessel, he sleeps on, for he knows no change, and when years have worn
          our road with a rut of godliness, we are apt to throw the reins on our
          horse's neck and sleep soundly.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, lastly let me give a little good advice to the sleeping
          Christian. But, Christian, if thou art asleep, thou wilt not hear me.
          I will speck gently, then, and let thee sleep on. No, I will not, I
          will shout in thine ears, |Awake, thou that sleepest! Arise from the
          dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Go to the ant, thou sluggard,
          consider her ways and be wise. Put on thy beautiful garments, O
          Jerusalem. Put on thy glorious array, thou church of the living God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But now what is the best plan to keep awake when you are going across
          the enchanted ground? This book tells us that one of the best plans is
          to keep Christian company, and talk about the ways of the Lord.
          Christian and Hopeful said to themselves, |Let us talk together, and
          then we shall not sleep.| Christian said, |Brother, where shall we
          begin?| And Hopeful said, |We will begin where God began with us.|
          There is no subject so likely to keep a man awake as talking of the
          place where God began with him. When Christian men talk together they
          won't sleep together. Hold Christian company, and you will not be so
          likely to slumber. Christians who isolate themselves and stand alone
          are very liable to lie down and sleep on the settle or the soft couch,
          and go to sleep; but, if you talk much together, as they did in old
          time, you will find it extremely beneficial. Two Christians talking
          together of the ways of the Lord will go much faster to heaven than
          one; and when a whole church unite in specking of the Lord's loving
          kindness, verily, beloved, there is no way like that of keeping
          themselves awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let me remind you that if you will look at interesting things you
          will not sleep; and how can you be kept awake in the enchanted ground
          better than by holding up your Saviour before your eyes? There are
          some things, it is said, which will not let men shut their eyes if
          they are held before them. Jesus Christ crucified on Calvary is one of
          them. I never knew a Christian go to sleep at the foot of the cross;
          but he always said --
        </p>
        <p>|Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,</p>
        <p>Which before the cross I spend.|</p>
        <p>And he said, too --</p>
        <p>|Here I'd sit, for ever viewing</p>
        <p>Mercies' streams in streams of blood.|</p>
        <p>
          But he never said, |Here I would lay down and sleep;| for he could not
          sleep with that shriek, |Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,| in his ears.
          He could not sleep with |It is finished!| going into his very soul.
          Keep thou near to the cross, Christian, and thou wilt not sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I would advise thee to let the wind blow on thee; let the breath
          of the Holy Spirit continually fan thy temples, and thou wilt not
          sleep. Seek to live daily under the influence of the Holy Ghost;
          derive all thy strength from him, and thou wilt not slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, labor to impress thyself with a deep sense of the value of the
          place to which thou art going. If thou rememberest that thou art going
          to heaven, thou wilt not sleep on the road. If thou thinkest that hell
          is behind thee, and the devil pursuing thee, I am sure thou wilt not
          be inclined to sleep. Would the man-slayer sleep if the avenger of
          blood were behind him, and the city of refuge before him? Christian,
          wilt thou sleep whilst the pearly gates are open; the songs of angels
          waiting for thee to join them; a crown decorated with delight to be
          worn upon thy brow? Ah, no!
        </p>
        <p>|Forget the steps already trod,</p>
        <p>And onward urge thy way.|</p>
        <p>|Weak as thou art, thou shalt not faint,</p>
        <p>Or, fainting, shalt not die;</p>
        <p>He feeds the strength of every saint,</p>
        <p>He'll help thee from on high.|</p>
        <p>
          Dearly beloved, I have finished my sermon. There are some of you that
          I must dismiss, because I find nothing in the text for you. It is
          said, |Let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.|
          There are some here who do not sleep at all, because they are
          positively dead; and, if it takes a stronger voice than mine to wake
          the sleeper, how much more mighty must be that voice which wakes the
          dead. Yet even to the dead I speck; for God can wake them, though I
          cannot. O, dead man! dost thou not know that thy body and thy soul are
          worthless carrion? that whilst thou art dead thou liest abhorred of
          God, abhorred of man? that soon the vultures of remorse will come and
          devour thy lifeless soul; and, though thou hast lived in this world
          these seventy years (perhaps) without God and without Christ, in thy
          last hour the vulture of remorse shall come and tear thy spirit; and,
          though thou laughest now at the wild bird that circles in the sky, he
          will descend upon thee soon, and thy death will be a bed of shrieks,
          howlings, and wailings, and lamentations and yells! Dost thou know
          more still, that afterwards that dead soul will be cast into Tophet;
          and, as in the East they burn the bodies, so thy body and thy soul
          together shall be burned in hell? Go not away and dream that this is a
          metaphor. It is truth. Say not it is a fiction; laugh not at it as a
          mere picture. Hell is a positive flame; it is a fire that burns the
          body, albeit that it burns the soul, too. There is physical fire for
          the body, and there is spiritual fire for the soul. Go thy way, O man;
          such shall be thy fate. E'en now thy funeral pile is building, thy
          years of sin have laid huge trees across each other; and see, the
          angel is flying down from heaven with a brand already lit; thou art
          lying dead upon the pile; he puts the brand to the base thereof; thy
          disease proves that the lower parts are kindling with the flame; those
          pains of thine are the crackling of the fire. It shall reach thee
          soon, thou poor diseased one; thou art near death, and when it reaches
          thee thou shalt know the meaning of the fire that is unquenchable, and
          the worm that dieth not. Yet while there is hope I will tell thee the
          gospel. |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that
          believeth not shall be,| must be |damned.| He that believeth on the
          Lord Jesus, that is, with a simple, naked faith, comes and puts his
          trust in him, shall be saved, without anything else; but he that
          believeth not shall inevitably -- hear it, men, and tremble -- he that
          believeth not shall assuredly be damned.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S. -- It is frequently objected that the preacher is censorious: he
          is not desirous of defending himself from the charge. He is confident
          that many are conscious that his charges are true, and if true,
          Christian love requires us to warn those who err; nor will candid men
          condemn the minister who is bold enough to point out the faults of the
          church and the age, even when all classes are moved to anger by his
          faithful rebukes, and pour on his head the full vials of their wrath.
          IF THIS BE VILE, WE PURPOSE TO BE VILER STILL. -- C.H.S.<br />
