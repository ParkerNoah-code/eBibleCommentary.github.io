          17. But the goodness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting
          upon them that fear him, and his righteousness upon the children's
          children; 18. To those who keep his covenant, and remember his
          statutes to do them

          17. But the goodness of Jehovah, etc The Psalmist leaves nothing to
          men to rely upon but the mercy of God; for it would be egregious folly
          to seek a ground of confidence in themselves. After having shown the
          utter emptiness of men, he adds the seasonable consolation, that,
          although they have no intrinsic excellence, which does not vanish into
          smoke, yet God is an inexhaustible fountain of life, to supply their
          wants. This contrast is to be particularly observed; for whom does he
          thus divest of all excellence? The faithful who are regenerated by the
          Spirit of God, and who worship him with true devotion, these are the
          persons whom he leaves nothing on which their hope may rest but the
          mere goodness of God. As the Divine goodness is everlasting, the
          weakness and frailty of the faithful does not prevent them from
          boasting of eternal salvation to the close of life, and even in death
          itself. David does not confine their hope within the limits of time --
          he views it as commensurate in duration with the grace on which it is
          founded. To goodness is subjoined righteousness, a word, as we have
          had occasion frequently to observe before, denoting the protection by
          which God defends and preserves his own people. He is then called
          righteous, not because he rewards every man according to his desert,
          but because he deals faithfully with his saints, in spreading the hand
          of his protection over them. The Prophet has properly placed this
          righteousness after goodness, as being the effect of goodness. He also
          asserts that it extends to the children and children's children,
          according to these words in Deuteronomy 7:9, |God keepeth mercy to a
          thousand generations.| It is a singular proof of his love that he not
          only receives each of us individually into his favor, but also herein
          associates with us our offspring, as it were by hereditary right, that
          they may be partakers of the same adoption. How shall He cast us off,
          who, in receiving our children and children's children into his
          protection, shows to us in their persons how precious our salvation is
          in his sight?

          Farther, as nothing is more easy than for hypocrites to flatter
          themselves under a false pretext, that they are in favor with God, or
          for degenerate children groundlessly to apply to themselves the
          promises made to their fathers, it is again stated, by way of
          exception, in the 18th verse, that God is merciful only to those who,
          on their part, keep his covenant, which the unbelieving make of none
          effect by their wickedness. The keeping, or observing of the covenant,
          which is here put instead of the fear of God, mentioned in the
          preceding verse, is worthy of notice; for thus David intimates that
          none are the true worshippers of God but those who reverently obey his
          Word. Very far from this are the Papists, who, thinking themselves
          equal to the angels in holiness, nevertheless shake off the yoke of
          God, like wild beasts, by trampling under foot his Holy Word. David,
          therefore, rightly judges of men's godliness, by their submitting
          themselves to the Word of God, and following the rule which he has
          prescribed to them. As the covenant begins with a solemn article
          containing the promise of grace, faith and prayer are required, above
          all things, to the proper keeping of it. Nor is the additional clause
          superfluous -- who remember his statutes; for, although God is
          continually putting us in mind of them, yet we soon slide away to
          worldly cares -- are confused by a multiplicity of avocations, and are
          lulled asleep by many allurements. Thus forgetfulness extinguishes the
          light of truth, unless the faithful stir up themselves from time to
          time. David tells us that this remembrance of God's statutes has an
          invigorating effect when men employ themselves in doing them. Many are
          sufficiently forward to discourse upon them with their tongues whose
          feet are very slow, and whose hands are well nigh dead, in regard to
          active service.<br />
