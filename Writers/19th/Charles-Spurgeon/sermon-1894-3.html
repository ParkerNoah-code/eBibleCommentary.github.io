And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out. And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p><p> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak, the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more. And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men be come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p><p> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side. And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff. And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now I had killed thee. And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me: and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive. And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.</p><p> So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the city of Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p><p> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth. And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height. And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. And he took up his parable, and said:</p><p> From Aram hath Balak brought me,<br/>The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:<br/>Come, curse me Jacob,<br/>And come, defy Israel.<br/>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?<br/>And how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied? For from the top of the rocks I see him,<br/>And from the hills I behold him:<br/>Lo, it is a people that dwell alone,<br/>And shall not be reckoned among the nations.<br/>Who can count the dust of Jacob,<br/>Or number the fourth part of Israel?<br/>Let me die the death of the righteous,<br/>And let my last end be like his!</p><p> And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?</p><p> And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder. And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken? And he took up his parable, and said:</p><p> Rise up, Balak, and hear;<br/>Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:<br/>God is not a man, that he should lie;<br/>Neither the son of man, that he should repent:<br/>Hath he said, and shall he not do it?<br/>Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<br/>Behold, I have received commandment to bless:<br/>And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.<br/>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,<br/>Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:<br/>The LORD his God is with him,<br/>And the shout of a king is among them.<br/>God bringeth them forth out of Egypt;<br/>He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.<br/>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob,<br/>Neither is there any divination against Israel:<br/>Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness,<br/>And as a lion doth he lift himself up:<br/>He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,<br/>And drink the blood of the slain.</p><p> And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?</p><p> And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. And he took up his parable, and said:</p><p>Balaam the son of Beor saith,<br/>And the man whose eye is opened saith:<br/>He saith, which heareth the words of God,<br/>Which seeth the vision of the Almighty,<br/>Falling down, and having his eyes open:</p><p>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,<br/>Thy tabernacles, O Israel!<br/>As valleys are they spread forth,<br/>As gardens by the river side,<br/>As lign-aloes which the LORD hath planted,<br/>As cedar trees beside the waters.<br/>Water shall flow from his buckets,<br/>And his seed shall be in many waters,<br/>And his king shall be higher than Agag,<br/>And his kingdom shall be exalted.<br/>God bringeth him forth out of Egypt;<br/>He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox:<br/>He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,<br/>And shall break their bones in pieces,<br/>And smite them through with his arrows.<br/>He couched, he lay down as a lion,<br/>And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?<br/>Blessed be every one that blesseth thee,<br/>And cursed be every one that curseth thee.</p><p>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what the LORD speaketh, that will I speak? And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. And he took up his parable, and said:</p><p>Balaam the son of Beor saith,<br/>And the man whose eye is opened saith:<br/>He saith, which heareth the words of God,<br/>And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High,<br/>Which seeth the vision of the Almighty,<br/>Falling down, and having his eyes open:</p><p>I see him, but not now:<br/>I behold him, but not nigh:<br/>There shall come forth a star out of Jacob,<br/>And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,<br/>And shall smite through the corners of Moab,<br/>And break down all the sons of tumult.<br/>And Edom shall be a possession,<br/>Seir also shall be a possession, which were his enemies; While Israel doeth valiantly.<br/>And out of Jacob shall one have dominion,<br/>And shall destroy the remnant from the city.</p><p>And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said:</p><p>Amalek was the first of the nations;<br/>But his latter end shall come to destruction.</p><p>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said:</p><p>Strong is thy dwelling place,<br/>And thy nest is set in the rock.<br/>Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,<br/>Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p><p>And he took up his parable, and said:</p><p>Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?<br/>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim,<br/>And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, And he also shall come to destruction.</p><p>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.</p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
