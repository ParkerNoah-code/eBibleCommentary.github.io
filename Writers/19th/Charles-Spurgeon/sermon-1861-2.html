        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.349)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 9th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          |Suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.| --
          Jeremiah 4:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE sorrow of the weeping prophet was exceeding heavy when he uttered
          these words of bitter lamentation. A great and present burden from the
          Lord is weighing so heavily upon our hearts this morning, that we
          cannot spare so much as a moment for sympathy with the griefs of past
          ages. God has visited our land, and his strokes have been exceeding
          hard. We are constrained to take up a wailing, and cry aloud,
          |Suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.| There is
          a spot in South Wales which has frequently yielded me a quiet and
          delightful retreat. Beautiful for situation, surrounded by lofty
          mountains, pierced by romantic valleys, the breathing of its air
          refreshes the body, and the sight of the eyes makes glad the heart. I
          have climbed its hills, I have seen the ever widening landscape, the
          mountains of Wales, the plains of England, and the seas sparkling
          afar. I have descended the hills and marked the mist creeping up the
          side of the hills and covering the woods in clouds. I have mingled
          with its godly men and women, and worshipped God in their assemblies.
          These lips have ministered the Word in that once happy valley. I have
          been fired with the glorious enthusiasm of the people when they have
          listened to the Word. Well doth my soul remember one night, which I
          shall never forget in time or in eternity, when, crowded together in
          the place of worship, hearty Welsh miners responded to every word of
          Christ's minister, with their |gogoniants| encouraging me to preach
          the Gospel, and crying |Glory to God| while the message was
          proclaimed. I remember how they constrained me, and kept me well nigh
          to midnight, preaching three semons, one after another, almost without
          rest, for they loved to listen to the gospel. God was present with us,
          and many a time has the baptismal pool been stirred since then by the
          fruit of that night's labour. Nor shall I ever forget when standing in
          the open air beneath God's blue sky, I addressed a mighty gathering
          within a short distance of that spot; when the Spirit of God was
          poured upon us, and men and women were swayed to and fro under the
          heavenly message, as the corn is moved in waves by the summer winds.
          Great was our joy that day when the people met together in thousands,
          and with songs and praises separated to their homes, talking of what
          they had heard. But now our visitation of that neighbourhood must ever
          be mingled with sorrow. How hath God been pleased to smite down strong
          men, and to take away the young men upon a sudden! |How suddenly are
          my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.| Oh! vale of Risca, I
          take up a lamentation for thee: the Lord hath dealt sorely with thee.
          Behold, and see if there be sorrow in any valley like unto thy sorrow
          which is done unto thee. The angel of death has emptied out his quiver
          upon thee; the awful reaper hath gathered to himself full sheaves from
          thy beautifull valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          You all know the story; it scarce needs that I should tell it to you.
          Last Saturday week some two hundred or more miners descended in health
          and strength to their usual work in the bowels of the earth. They had
          not been working long, their wives and their children had risen, and
          their little ones had gone to their schools, when suddenly there was
          heard a noise at the mouth of the pit; -- it was an explosion, -- all
          knew what it meant. Men's hearts failed them, for well they prophesied
          the horror which would soon reveal itself. They wait awhile, the foul
          gas must first be scattered, brave men with their lives in their hands
          descend into the pit, and when they are able to see with the dim
          miner's lamp, the light falls upon corpse after corpse. A few, a
          handful are brought up alive, and scarce alive, but yet, thank God,
          with enough of the vital spark remaining to be again kindled to a
          flame; but the great mass of those strong men have felt the grip of
          death. Some of them were brought up to the top with their faces burned
          and scarred, with their bodies disfigured by the fire; but many are
          discovered whose faces looked as if they sweetly slept, so that it was
          scarcely possible to believe that they really could be dead, so
          quietly had the spirit quitted the habitation of clay. Can you picture
          to yourselves the scene? The great fires lit around the pit, flaming
          both night and day, the thick mist, the pouring rain drenching the
          whole of the valley. Do you see the women as they come clustering
          round the pit, shrieking for their sons, and their husbands, and their
          fathers. Do you hear that shrill scream as yonder woman has just
          discovered the partner of her soul; and there do you mark another
          bending over the form of her two stalwart sons, now alas taken from
          her for ever? Do you mark the misery that sits upon the face of some
          who have not found their sons, or their fathers, or their husbands, or
          their brothers, and who know not where they are, and feel a thousand
          deaths themselves because they feel convinced that their precious ones
          have fallen, though their corpses cannot be found? The misery in that
          valley is past description; those who have witnessed it, fail to be
          able to picture it. As the cry of Egypt in the night when the
          destroying angel went through all the land and smote the firstborn; as
          the wail of Rachel when she could not be comforted for her children,
          because they were not; such has been the howling, the weeping, the
          lamentation of that fair but desolate valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends, this judgment has a voice to us, and the scarce buried
          bodies of those men which lie around us in vision, have each a
          sorrowful lesson. The cry of the widow, and of the childless mother,
          shall come up into our ears to-day; and, O Lord God of Saboath, may it
          so arouse us that we may hear, and fear, and tremble, and turn unto
          thee -- that this dread calamity may be to us the means of our
          salvation, or if saved, the means of stirring us up more earnestly to
          seek the salvation of our fellow men.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three points upon which I shall try to address you this
          morning, though I feel inadequate to such a task. First, I shall say
          somewhat upon sudden bereavements; then I shall dwell awhile upon the
          fact of sudden death; and afterwards we will say but a little, for we
          know but little, of the sudden exchange which sudden death shall bring
          both to saints and sinners.
        </p>
        <p>I. Our first sorrowful theme is SUDDEN BEREAVEMENTS.</p>
        <p>
          Alas! alas! how soon may we be childless; how soon may we be widowed
          of the dearest objects of our affections! O Lord, thou hast shown to
          us this day, how soon thou canst blast our gourds and wither all the
          fruits of our vineyard. The dearest ones, the partners of our blood,
          how soon can death proclaim a divorce between us -- our children, the
          offspring of our loins, how soon canst thou lay them beneath the sod.
          We have not a single relative who may not become to us within the next
          moment a fountain of grief. All that are dear and precious to us are
          only here by God's good pleasure. What should we be to-day if it were
          not for those whom we love, and who love us? What were our house
          without its little prattlers? What were our habitation without the
          wife of our bosom? What were our daily business without our associates
          and friends to cheer us in our trials? Ah! this were a sad world
          indeed, if the ties of kindred, of affection, and of friendship all be
          snapped; and yet it is such a world that they must be sundered, and
          may be divided at any moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the fact that sudden bereavements are possible -- not only to
          miners and to women whose husbands are upon the sea, but to us also --
          I would that we would learn profitable lessons. And first let us learn
          to set loose by our dearest friends that we have on earth. Let us love
          them -- love them we may, love them we should -- but let us always
          learn to love them as dying things. Oh, build not thy nest on any of
          these trees, for they are all marked for the axe. |Set not thine
          affections on things on earth,| for the things of earth must leave
          thee, and then what wilt thou do when thy joy is emptied, and the
          golden bowl which held thy mirth shall be dashed to pieces? Love first
          and foremost Christ; and when thou lovest others, still love them not
          as though they were immortal. Love not clay as though it were undying
          -- love not dust as though it were eternal. So hold thy friend that
          thou shalt not wonder when he vanishes from thee; so view the
          partakers of thy life that thou wilt not be amazad when they glide
          into the land of spirits. See thou the disease of mortality on every
          cheek, and write not Eternal upon the creature of an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care that thou puttest all thy dear ones into God's hand. Thou
          hast put thy soul there, put them there. Thou canst trust him for
          temporals for thyself, trust thy jewels with him. Feel that they are
          not thine own, but that they are God's loans to thee; loans which may
          be recalled at any moment -- precious benisons of heaven, not entailed
          upon thee, but of which thou art but a tenant at will. Your
          possessions are never so safe as when you are willing to resign them,
          and you are never so rich as when you put all you have into the hand
          of God. You shall find it greatly mitigate the sorrow of bereavements,
          if before bereavement you shall have learned to surrender every day
          all the things that are dearest to you into the keeping of your
          gracious God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, then, you who are blessed with wife and children, and
          friends, take care that you bless God for them. Sing a song of praise
          to God who hath blessed you so much than others. You are not a widow,
          but there are many that wear the weeds, and why is it not your lot?
          You are not bereaven of your spouse, but there is many a man whose
          heart is rent in twain by such a calamity, -- why is it not your
          portion too? You have not to follow to-morrow your little ones to
          their narrow graves -- early flowers that did but bud and never
          ripened, withering alas! too soon. Oh! by the sorrow which you would
          feel if they were taken away, I exhort you to bless God for them while
          you have them. We sorrow much when our gifts are taken away, but we
          fail to thank God that he spared them to us so long. Oh! be not
          ungrateful, lest thou provoke the Lord to smite very low the mercy
          which thou dost not value. Sing unto the Lord, sing unto his name.
          Give unto him the blessing which he deserves for his sparing favors
          which he has manifested towards you in your household.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then permit me to remind you that if these sudden bereavements may
          come, and there may be a dark chamber in any house in a moment, and
          the coffin may be in any one of our habitations, let us so act to our
          kinsfolk and relatives as though we knew they were soon about to die.
          Young man, so treat thy hoary father as thou wouldst behave to him if
          thou knewest he would die to-morrow. When thou shalt follow him to the
          grave, amidst all thy tears for his loss, let there not be one tear of
          repentance because of thine ill behaviour to him. And you godly
          fathers and mothers, to you I have a special message -- your children
          are committed to your care; they are growing up, and what if after
          they be grown up they should plunge into sin and die at last
          impenitent! Oh, let not the fierce regret sting you like an adder, --
          |Oh that I had prayed for my children! Oh that I had taught them
          before they departed.| I pray you so live, that when you stand over
          your child's dead body you may never hear a voice coming up from that
          clay, |Father, thy negligence was my destruction. Mother, thy want of
          prayer was the instrument of my damnation.| But so live, that when you
          hear the funeral knell, for a neighbour even, you may be able to say,
          |Poor soul, whether he is gone to heaven or to hell, I know I am clear
          of is blood.| And with double earnestness be it so with your children.
          |Yes,| says one |but I have thought of teaching my children more of
          Christ, and being more earnest in prayer for them bye-and-bye,| but
          what if they should die to-morrow? |Yes,| says the wife, |I have
          thought of speaking to my ungodly husband, and trying to induce him to
          attend the house of God with me, but I was afraid he would only laugh
          at me, so I put it off for a month or two.| Ah! what if he dies before
          you have cleared your conscience of him? Oh, my brothers and sisters
          in Christ, if sinners will be damned, at least let them leap to hell
          over our bodies; and if they will perish, let them perish with our
          arms about their knees, imploring them to stay, and not madly to
          destroy themselves. If hell must be filled, at least let it be filled
          in the teeth of our exertions, and let not one go there unwarned and
          unprayed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the light, then, of sudden bereavements, let not another hour pass
          over your head, when you have reached home, before you have freed your
          conscience of the blood of your children's souls. Gather them together
          around you this afternoon, and say to them, |My dear children, I have
          learned to day that you may die; I knew it before, but I have had it
          impressed upon my mind by a solemn incident. My dear children, I
          cannot help telling you, that as you must die, I am anxious that God's
          Holy Spirit should graciously lead you to repent of sin and seek a
          Saviour.| And then, when you have told them the way to salvation in
          simple terms, put your arms about their necks, and bid the little ones
          kneel down and pray, |O God! upon their infant hearts, stamp thou, the
          image of thyself. As they are in the image of the earthy, so make them
          in the image of the heavenly, that at the last I may be able to say,
          Here am I, and the children thou hast given me.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second head of my discourse this morning was to be, SUDDEN
          DEATH, AS WE VIEW IT MORE PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO OURSELVES.
        </p>
        <p>
          The miners of Risca had no more idea of dying that Saturday morning
          than you or I have, nor did there seem much likelihood that they
          would. They had gone up and down the pit, some of them, many thousands
          of times in their lives. It is true that some had perished there, but
          then, how very many had gone up and down and had not perished. Nay,
          they had grown so fearless of danger, that some of them even thrust
          themselves into it, and in defiance of every regulation for the
          preservation of human life, they were bold and careless, and would
          gratify a selfish indulgence when a spark might have caused the
          destruction of them all. We will not say that it was any negligence
          that caused this accident -- God forbid that we should lay anything to
          the charge of those who have now departed, and have to answer before
          their God -- but, at any rate, sure it is that men who have most to do
          with danger are generally the most callous, and those who are most
          exposed are usually utterly careless about the very danger which
          others see but which they will not see themselves. Any warning you or
          I might have given them would have been thought unnecessary, if not
          impertinent. |Why need I be so careful? I have done this fifty times
          before. Why may I not do it again?| But as in a moment, although there
          was no lightning flash, no earthquake, no opening of a pit to swallow
          them up, quick in a moment the gas explodes and they stand before the
          Eternal God. It was but the twinkling of an eye, even as though the
          last trump had sounded (and indeed it did sound as far as they were
          concerned), and down fell the lifeless corpse, and the spirit returned
          to God who made it. And you and I are in danger too. We are not in the
          pit in the midst of explosive air, but there are a thousand gates to
          death. How many there be who have fallen dead in the streets? How many
          sitting in their own homes? I stayed but a week or two ago with an
          excellent Christian man, who was then in the halest and most hearty
          health. I was startled indeed when I heard immediately after that he
          had come home, and sitting down in his chair had shut his eyes and
          died. And these things are usual, and in such a city as ours we cannot
          go down a street without hearing of some such visitation. Well, our
          turn must come. Perhaps we shall die falling asleep in our beds after
          long sickness, but probably we shall be suddenly called in such an
          hour as we think not to face the realities of eternity. Well, if it be
          so, if there be a thousand gates to death, if all means and any means
          may be sufficient to stop the current of our life, if really, after
          all, spiders' webs and bubbles are more substantial things than human
          life, if we are but a vapour, or a dying taper that soon expires in
          darkness, what then? Why, first, I say, let us all look upon ourselves
          as dying men, let us not reckon on to-morrow. Oh! let us not
          procrastinate, for taken in Satan's great net of procrastination we
          may wait, and wait, and wait, till time is gone and the great knell of
          eternity shall toll our dissolution. To-day is your only time. O
          mortal men, the present moment is the only moment you may call your
          own, and oh! how swift its wings! This hour is yours; yesterday is
          gone; to-morrow is with God, and may never come. |To-day if ye hear
          his voice harden not your hearts.| Many have had their first
          impressions from thoughts of death, and hence it is that Satan never
          likes to let a man think of the grave. I know a family in which the
          governess, the daughter of a Christian minister, was told upon her
          entering her office, that she was never to mention the subject of
          death to the children. They were never to know even that children
          might die. I did not marvel when I knew the infidelity of the head of
          the household. What better atmosphere for an infidel to breathe in,
          than where the blast of death is never felt? Infidels ought to be
          immortal. They ought to live in a world where they can never die, for
          their infidelity will never be able to pass the stream of Jordan.
          There are infidels on earth, but there are none in heaven, and there
          can be none in hell. They are convinced -- convinced by terrible facts
          -- convinced that there is a God while they are crushed beneath his
          vengeance, and made to tremble at his eternal power. But I pray you,
          sirs, be not such fools as to live as though your bones were iron and
          your ribs were brass. Let us not be such madmen as to run as though
          there were no bounds to our race; let us not play away our precious
          days as though days were common as sands on a sea shore. That
          hour-glass yonder contains all the sands of your life. Do you see them
          running? How swiftly do they empty out! With some of you, the most of
          the sands are in the bottom bulb of the glass, and there are only a
          few to go trickling through the narrow passway of its days. Ah! and
          that glass shall never be turned again; it shall never run a second
          time for you. Let it once run out and you will die. Oh! live as though
          you meant to die. Live as though you knew you might die to-morrow.
          Think as though you might die now, and act this very hour as though I
          could utter the mandate of death, and summon you to pass through the
          portals of the tomb.

          And then take care, I pray you, that you who do know Christ not only
          live as though you meant to die, but live while you live. Oh what a
          work we have to do, and how short the time to do it! Millions of men
          unconverted yet, and nothing but our feeble voice with which to preach
          the Word! My soul, shalt thou ever condemn thyself in thy dying
          moments for having preached too often or too earnestly? No, never.
          Thou mayest rebuke thy soul, but thou canst never bemoan thy excessive
          industry. Minister of Christ! in thy dying hour it will never be a
          theme of reproach to you that you preached ten times in the week, that
          you stood up every day to preach Christ, and that you so preached that
          you spent yourself, and wasted your body with weakness. No, it will be
          our dull sermons that will haunt us on our dying beds, our tearless
          preaching, our long studyings, when we might have preached better had
          we come away and preached without them; our huntings after popularity,
          by gathering together fine words, instead of coming right up, and
          saying to the people, |Men and women, you are dying, escape for your
          life and fly to Christ;| preaching to them in red-hot simple words of
          the wrath to come and of the love of Christ. Oh! there are some of you
          members of our churches, who are living, but what are you living for?
          Surely you are not living to get money -- that is the worldling's
          object. Are you living merely to please yourselves? Why that is but
          the beast's delight. Oh! how few there are of the members of our
          churches who really live for God with all their might. Do we give to
          God as much as we give to our own pleasures? Do we give Christ's
          service as much time as we give to many of our trifling amusements?
          Why, we have professional men of education, men of excellent training
          and ability, who when they once get into a church, feel that they
          could be very active anywhere else, but as Christians they have
          nothing to do. They can be energetic in parish vestries or in the
          rifle corps, but in the church they give their name, but their
          energies are dormant. Ah! my dear hearers, you who love the Saviour,
          when we shall come before Christ in heaven, if there can be a regret,
          it will be that we did not do more for Christ while we were here. I
          think as we fall down before his feet and worship him, if we could
          know a sorrow, it would be because we did not bring him in more jewels
          for his crown -- did not seek more to feed the hungry, or to clothe
          the naked -- did not give more to his cause, and did not labour more
          that the lost sheep of the house of Israel might be restored. Live
          while you live; while it is called to-day, work, for the night cometh
          wherein no man can work.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let us learn never to do anything which we would not wish to be
          found doing if we were to die. We are sometimes asked by young people
          whether they may go to the theatre, whether they may dance, or whether
          they may do this or that. You may do anything which you would not be
          ashamed to be doing when Christ shall come. You may do anything which
          you would not blush to be found doing if the hand of death should
          smite you; but if you would dread to die in any spot, go not there; if
          you would not wish to enter the presence of your God with
          such-and-such a word upon your lip, utter not that word; or if there
          would be a thought that would be uncongenial to the judgement-day,
          seek not to think that thought. So act that you may feel you can take
          your shroud with you wherever you go. Happy is he that dies in his
          pulpit. Blessed is the man that dies in his daily business, for he is
          found with his loins girt about him serving his Master; but, oh,
          unhappy must he be to whom death comes as an intruder, and finds him
          engaged in that which he will blush to have ever touched, when God
          shall appear in judgment. Power supreme; thou everlasting King; permit
          not death to intrude upon an ill-spent hour, but find me rapt in
          meditation high; hymning my great Creator; proclaiming the love of
          Jesus, or lifting up my heart in prayer for myself and my
          fellow-sinners. Let me but serve my God, and then, Death, I will not
          say to thee when thou mayest come -- come when thou wilt; but if I
          might choose, come to me while I am yearning after souls; come to me
          when the cry of inviting love is on my lip, and when I am weeping over
          the souls of men. Come to me, then, that men may say,
        </p>
        <p>|He did his body with his charge lay down,</p>
        <p>He ceased at once to work and live.|</p>
        <p>
          But I may talk thus about sudden death and the likelihood of it, but
          ah! sirs, I cannot stir your hearts, for I cannot stir my own as I
          would. The fact that so many die each day has very little force in it
          for us, because it is so trite an event, we have heard of it so many
          times. We look down the catalogue of deaths and take the average, and
          we say, |Fifty below the average, or a hundred above the average,| but
          our dying never comes home to us. All men will persist in thinking all
          men mortal but themselves. If there were a great Hydra in the city of
          London, which every day ate ten of the inhabitants of London alive, we
          should be dreadfully miserable, especially if we never knew when it
          would be our turn to be eaten too. If we were certain that it would
          eat all in London by-and-bye, but would only eat ten in a week, we
          should all tremble as we passed by the huge monster's den, and say,
          |When will it be my time?| and that would cast a cloud over the whole
          metropolis, blacker than its usual fog. But here is a monster, Death,
          which devours its hundreds at its meal; and with its iron tongue the
          funeral knell keeps crying out for more; its greedy and insatiable maw
          never being filled; its teeth never being blunted; its ravenous hunger
          never being stayed. And here we are, and though it will be our turn
          by-and-bye to be devoured of this great monster, yet how little do we
          think about it! One reason I think is, because we so seldom visit the
          dying. I stood once by the side of a poor boy whom I had taught as a
          Sunday-school teacher; he had received very little good training at
          home, and though he was but a lad of seventeen, he became a drunkard
          and drank himself to death at one debauch. I saw him, and talked to
          him, and tried to point him to the Saviour, and heard at last the
          death-rattle in his throat, and as I went down stairs I thought
          everybody a fool for doing anything except preparing to die. I began
          to look upon the men who drove the carts in the street, the men who
          were busy at their shops, and those who were selling their wares, as
          being all foolish for doing anything except their eternal business,
          and myself most of all foolish for not pointing dying sinners to a
          living Christ, and inviting them to trust in his precious blood. And
          yet in an hour or so all things took their usual shape, and I began to
          think that I was not dying after all, and I could go away and be I
          fear as heartless as before. I could begin to think that men were
          after all wise in thinking of this world, and not the next; I mean not
          that I really thought so, but I fear I acted as if I thought so; the
          impression of the dying-bed was so soon obliterated. If you could see
          all die who die, perhaps the impression would be different. I would
          liken the sons of men to a company of South Sea Islanders, whose canoe
          being disabled, floated upon a raft, and they were attacked by sharks;
          they disappeared one by one, till but three or four were left. Can you
          conceive the despair which would settle upon the countenances of these
          few? If they knew a God, do you not think they would then indeed call
          on him? And in what respect, except that death was more apparent to
          them, were they different from us? Man after man is being taken away
          from us by the devouring monster. Friends and kinsfolk have been
          snatched into the deep, and some of us remain upon the edge of the
          raft. You gray-haired man may be the next that is carried away. The
          hosts of God are crossing the flood; some have already passed it and
          are singing the eternal song, and
        </p>
        <p>|We are to the margin come,</p>
        <p>And soon expect to die.|</p>
        <p>
          God help us so to live in the expectation of death, that Christ may be
          glorified in us whether we sleep or wake, and that we may be able to
          say, |For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall detain you but a few minutes longer, while I dwell upon
          the third theme, which is, THAT SUDDEN EXCHANGE WHICH A SUDDED DEATH
          WILL CAUSE.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see yonder Christian man, he is full of a thousand fears, he is
          afraid even of his interest in Christ, he is troubled spiritually, and
          vexed with temporal cares. You see him cast down and exceeding
          troubled, his faith but very weak; he steps outside your door, and
          there meets him a messenger from God, who smites him to the heart, and
          he is dead. Can you conceive the change? Death has cured him of his
          fears, his tears are wiped away once for all from his eyes; and, to
          his surprise, he stands where he feared he should never be, in the
          midst of the redeemed of God, in the general assembly and church of
          the first-born. If he should think of such things, would he not
          upbraid himself for thinking so much of his trouble, and for looking
          into a future which he was never to see? See yonder man, he can
          scarcely walk, he has a hundred pains in his body, he says he is more
          tried and pained than any man. Death puts his skeleton hand upon him,
          and he dies. How marvellous the change! No aches now, no casting down
          of spirit, he then is supremely blest, the decrepid has become
          perfect, the weak has become strong, the trembling one has become a
          David, and David has become as the angel of the Lord. Hark to the song
          which pours from the lips of him who just now groaned; look at the
          celestial smile which lights the features of the man just now racked
          with pain and tormented with anguish! Was ever change so surprising,
          so marvellous? When I think of it, I could almost long for it to come
          across myself this morning; to go from the thousand eyes of you that
          look upon me, to look into the eyes of Christ, and to go from your
          songs, to the songs of spirits before the throne, to leave the sabbath
          work on earth for an eternal sabbath of rest: to go from unbelieving
          hearts, from Christians who need to be cheered and sinners to be
          convinced, to be with those who need no preaching, but who in one
          eternal song, sing |Hallelujah to God and the Lamb.| I can imagine
          that when a man dies thus suddenly, one of the first emotions he
          experiences in the next world will be surprise. I can conceive that
          the spirit knows not where it is. It is like a man waking up from a
          dream. He looks about him. Oh, that glory! how resplendent you throne!
          He listens to harps of gold, and he can scarce believe it true. |I,
          the chief of sinners, and yet in heaven? I, a doubting one, and yet in
          paradise?| And then when he is conscious that he is really in heaven,
          oh! what overwhelming joy; how is the spirit flooded with delight,
          covered over with it, scarcely able to enjoy it because it seems to be
          all but crushed beneath the eternal weight of glory. And next, when
          the spirit has power to recover itself, and open its eyes from the
          blindness caused by this dazzling light, and to think -- when its
          thoughts have recovered themselves from the sudden effect of a
          tremendous flood of bliss, -- the next emotion will be gratitude. See
          how that believer, five minutes ago a mourner, now takes his crown
          from off his head, and with transporting joy and gratitude bows before
          his Saviour's throne. Hear how he sings; was ever song like that, the
          first song he ever sang that had the fulness of Paradise and
          perfection in it -- |Unto him that loved me and washed me from my sins
          in his blood, unto him be glory.| And how he repeats it, and repeats
          it again, and looks round to cherubim and seraphim, and prays them to
          assist him in his song, till all the harps of heaven re-taught the
          melody of gratitude, re-tuned by the one faithful heart, send up
          another hallelujah, and yet another, and another; while the floods of
          harmony surround the eternal throne of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what must be the change to the unconverted man? His joys are over
          for ever. His death is the death of his happiness -- his funeral is
          the funeral of his mirth. He has just risen from his cups; he has
          another cup to drain, which is full of bitterness. He has just
          listened to the sound of the harp and the viol, and the music of them
          that make merry; an eternal dirge greets his ears, mixed with the
          doleful chorus of the shrieks of damned souls. What horror and
          surprise shall seize upon him! |Good God,| he says, |I thought it was
          not so, but lo, it is. What the minister said to me is true; the
          things I would not believe are at last really so.| When the poor soul
          shall find itself in the hands of angry fiends, and lifts up his eyes
          in hell, being in torments so hot, so feverish, so thirsy, that it
          shall seem in that first moment as though it had been athirst for a
          million years, what will be his surprise! |And am I,| he will say,
          |really here? I was in the streets of London but a minute ago; I was
          singing a song but an instant before, and here am I in hell! What! so
          soon damned? Is the sentence of God like a lightning-flash? Does it so
          instantaneously rive the spirit and destroy its joys? Am I really
          here?| And when the soul has convinced itself that it is actually in
          hell, can you imagine next the overwhelming horror that will roll over
          it. It, too, will be stunned with a mighty flood, not with a flood of
          glory but with a flood of anger, of wrath, of divine justice. Oh! how
          the spirit is tormented now -- tormented beyond thought. And then at
          last, when the wave recedes a moment, and there is a pause, what black
          despair shall then seize upon the spirit! Have you ever seen men die
          without a hope? I read but yesterday a case of a young woman who had
          procrastinated many times, and at last whe was told by the physician
          that within nine hours he really believed she would be a corpse. Then,
          when death really became a matter of fact to her, she rose up in the
          bed upon which she had been laid by the sudden stroke of God, and she
          prayed -- prayed till she fell back fainting, and her lips were livid
          and her cheek was pale, while she cried, |God be merciful to me a
          sinner.| Friends talked to her, consoled and comforted her, and bade
          her trust in Christ; but she said, |It is of no use for you to comfort
          me; no, it is too late. I made a fatal resolve some months ago that I
          would again enjoy the world, and that resolve destroyed by soul.| And
          then she rose up in bed again, with eyes starting from their sockets,
          and prayed again till she was breathless, and groaned and cried, and
          fell down again in a faint, needing to be restored once more. And so
          she did, till with ghastly look -- an awful look of horror -- as
          though she felt the anguish of another world, she expired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if such is the remorse of a spirit before it feels the wrath of
          God -- if the first drops are sufficient thus to destroy all hope and
          beat in pieces all our boastings, what will the eternal hail be --
          what will the everlasting sleet of divine wrath be when once it is
          poured our? Sodom and Gomorrah! Why all their fiery hail from heaven
          shall be nothing compared with the eternal fire that must fall upon
          the sinner. Do you think I love to speak on such a theme as this? My
          soul trembles while she thinks of it. No, I would sooner preach of
          other things by far, but it is needful that men may be awakened. Oh! I
          implore you, men and brethren, ye that know not God, and are still
          condemned, because you believe not in Christ, I pray you think of
          these things. Oh that I had a Baxter's heart, that I could weep over
          sinners as he did; but my soul feels as true an anguish for your souls
          as ever Baxter felt. Oh that you would be saved! My eyes ache; my brow
          is full of fire now, because I cannot preach as I wanted to preach to
          you. Oh that God would take up the work and send that truth right
          home. I know I shall soon die and you too, and I shall face each of
          you, and your eyes shall stare on me for ever and ever, if you be lost
          through my unfaithfulness. And shall it be -- shall it be? Oh that we
          had a hope that all of us might see the face of God and live! |Believe
          in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Spirit of God, convince of sin, and bring the heart to Christ, and may
          we all without exception see thy face in joy and glory, and praise
          thee, world without end. Amen.<br />
