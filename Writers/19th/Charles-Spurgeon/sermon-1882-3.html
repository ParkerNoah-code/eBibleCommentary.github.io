        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard
          my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
          clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And he
          hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall
          see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.| -- Psalm 40:1-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS PASSAGE HAS BEEN USED with great frequency as the expression of
          the experience of the people of God, and I think it has been very
          rightly so used. It is a very accurate picture of the way in which
          sinners are raised up from despair to hope and salvation, and of the
          way in which saints are brought out of deep troubles, and made to sing
          of divine love and power. Yet I am not certain that the first verse
          could be truthfully uttered by all of us; I question, indeed, whether
          any of us could thus speak. Could we say -- |I waited patiently for
          the Lord.| Think ye, brethren, might it not read -- |I waited
          impatiently for the Lord,| in the case of most of us? All the rest may
          stand true, but this would need to be modified. We could hardly speak
          in our own commendation if we considered our conduct in the matter of
          patience, for that is, alas, still a scarce virtue -- upon the face of
          the earth. If we read the psalm through we shall see that it was not
          written exclusively to describe the experience of God's people.
          Secondarily we may regard it as David's language, but in the first
          instance a greater than David is here. The first Person who uttered
          these words was the Messiah, and that is quite clear if you read the
          psalm through; for we fall upon such language as this: |Sacrifice and
          offering, Thou didst not desire; mine ears hast Thou opened; burnt
          offering and sin offering hast Thou not required. Then said I, come I
          in the volume of the book it is written of Me, I delight to do thy
          will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.| We need not say with
          the Ethiopian, |Of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself or of
          some other?| For we are led at once by the plainest indications to see
          that He is not speaking of Himself, but of our Lord and if we needed
          confirmation of this we get it in Hebrews 10, where Paul expressly
          quotes this passage as referring to the Lord Jesus. To Him, indeed,
          alone of all men can it with accuracy be applied. So this morning I
          shall have to show that this text of ours is most fit to be the
          language of the Lord, our representative and covenant Head. When I
          have shown this, you will then see how we can use the self-same
          expressions, because we are in Him. Each believer becomes a mirror in
          which is reflected the experience of our Lord; but it would be ill for
          us to be so taken up with the mere reflection as to forget the express
          image by which this experience is formed in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall ask you, then, at this time, to observe our divine Lord when
          in His greatest trouble. Notice, first, our Lord's behavior -- |I
          waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my
          cry|: then consider, secondly, our Lord deliverance, expressed by the
          phrase, |He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry
          clay,| and so forth: then let us think, thirdly of the Lord's reward
          for it -- |many shall see, and fear, and trust in the Lord|: -- that
          is His great end and object, and in it He sees of the travail of His
          soul and is satisfied. We shall close, fourthly, by perceiving the
          Lord's likeness in all His saved ones; for they also are brought up
          from the pit of destruction, and a new song is put into their mouths.
          He is not ashamed to call them brethren, since in each one of them his
          own experience is repeated though upon a smaller scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, let us think of OUR LORD'S BEHAVIOR. |I waited patiently for
          the Lord.| Here we greatly need the teaching of the Holy Ghost; may it
          be given us abundantly. First, our Lord's conduct when He was under
          the smarting rod was that of waiting. He waited upon the Lord all His
          life, and this waiting became more conspicuous in His passion and
          death. He went down into Gethsemane, and there He prayed earnestly;
          but with sweet submission; for He said, |Nevertheless, not as I will,
          but as thou wilt.| Complete submission was the essential spirit of His
          prayer. He rose up from prayer all crimson with His bloody sweat, and
          He went to meet His foes, delivering Himself up voluntarily to be led
          as a sheep to the slaughter. He did not unsheathe the sword as Peter
          did; much less did He flee, like His disciples, but He waited upon the
          will of the Most High, enduring all things till the Father should give
          Him deliverance. When they took Him before Annas and Caiaphas, and
          Pilate and Herod, hurrying Him from bar to bar, how patiently He kept
          silence, though false witnesses appeared against Him. Like a sheep
          before her shearers He was dumb, submitting Himself without a
          struggle. In the omnipotence of patience He held His Peace even from
          good, because it was so written of Him. When they led Him away to
          crucifixion through the streets of Jerusalem He did not even encourage
          the lamentations of the sympathizing women who surrounded him; but in
          His wondrous patience He said, |Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for
          me.| He did not refuse to bear His cross, or to let the cross bear
          Him. He did not complain of contempt and contumely, since these were
          appointed Him. When they nailed Him to the tree, and there He hung in
          the burning sun, tortured, fevered, agonizing, the words that escaped
          Him were those of murmuring and repining, but those of pity, pain,
          patience, and submission. Till He bowed His head, and gave up the
          ghost, He bowed His whole being to His Father's will, waiting His time
          and pleasure. He steadily took a long draft at the appointed cup, and
          drained it to the bitter end. His eyes were unto the Lord as the eyes
          of servants are to the hands of their masters; He waited in service,
          in hope, in resignation, and in confidence. He knew that God would
          help Him and deliver Him, He knew that His head would be raised on
          high above the sons of men; but still He waited for the Father's time,
          and meanwhile made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the
          form of a servant, and as a servant yielded all His strength to the
          work which was given Him to do. He was willing in the hour of His
          passion to be treated as the scum and scorn of all mankind, nor did He
          hurry the hour when all the shame and scorn should blossom into glory
          and honor. He went down in His waiting even to the utmost of
          self-denial, and truly proved that He came not to do His own will, but
          the will of Him that sent Him. Never man served and waited like this
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text adds to this word |waited| the word |patiently.| |I waited
          patiently.| If you would see patience, look not at Job on the
          dunghill, but look at Jesus on the cross. Job, the most patient of
          men, was assuredly impatient at the same time; but this blessed Lord
          of ours gave Himself up completely, and showed not the slightest sign
          of repining. Not a speck of impatience can be detected in the crystal
          stream of our Lord's submission. His soul was all melted, and it all
          flowed into the mold of the Father's will: no dross was in or about
          Him, nothing which refused to melt and to run into the mold. One would
          have supposed that He would have spoken an angry word to Judas, who
          betrayed Him; instead of which He gently asked of Him, |Friend,
          wherefore art thou come?| It would not have seemed wonderful if He had
          upbraided the Jews who so falsely accused Him, or the rulers who so
          unjustly treated Him; but here is the patience of the saintly One, He
          was perfect master of His own Spirit. His answer to His murderers was
          the prayer, |Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.| So
          meek and lowly in heart was He that to men He gave no sharp replies:
          His answers were all steeped in gentleness; take for example His word
          to the high priest: |If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil;
          but if well, why smitest thou me?| They sat down around the cross and
          mocked Him, jeered at Him, insulted over Him, and made mirth even of
          His cries and prayers; but He did not utter a single word of rebuke,
          much less did He leap from the cross to dash His mockers in pieces,
          and prove by their destruction that He was indeed the mighty Son of
          God. |I waited patiently,| saith He. No thought or word or deed of
          impatience can be charged upon Him; waiting, He waited, and waited
          still. We are in such a hurry when we are in trouble; we hasten to
          escape from it at once; every minute seems an hour, and every day an
          age. |Help me speedily, my God!| is the natural cry of the child of
          God under the rod; but our Saviour was in no ill haste to get from the
          chastisement which came upon Him for our sakes: He was at leisure in
          His woe. So thoroughly was He resolved to do His Father's will that
          even on the morning of His resurrection He arose with deliberation,
          and quitted the grave in order, folding His grave -- clothes and
          laying the napkin by itself. He steadily persevered in all His work of
          holiness and sorrow of sacrifice, never accepting deliverance till His
          work was done. Patiently He endured to have His ear bored to the
          door-post, to have His head encircled with thorns, His cheeks
          disdained with spittle, His back furrowed with the lash, His hands and
          feet nailed to the wood, and His heart pierced with the spear. In His
          body on the tree patience was written out in crimson characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this was needful for the completeness of His atonement. No
          expiation could have been made by an impatient Saviour. Only a perfect
          obedience could satisfy the law; only an unblemished sacrifice could
          put away our sins. There must not, therefore, be about our Substitute
          a trace of resistance to the Father's will, nor as a sacrifice must He
          struggle against the cords, or turn His head away from the sacrificial
          knife. In truth, His was a willing, patient doing and suffering of the
          divine will. |He gave His back to the smiters and His cheeks to them
          that plucked off the hair: He hid not His face from shame and
          spitting.| |I waited patiently for the Lord,| saith He; and you know,
          brethren, how true was the declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while the Saviour thus waited, and waited patiently, we must not
          forget that He waited prayerfully, for the text speaks of a cry which
          He lifted up, and of God's inclining Himself to it. That patience
          which does not pray is obstinacy. A soul silent to God is apt to be
          sullen rather than submissive. A stoical patience hardens itself
          against grief, and asks no deliverance; but that is not the patience
          which God loves, it is not the patience of Christ. He used strong
          crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death. Let
          Gethsemane tell of that wrestling which infinitely excelled the
          wrestling of Jacob: Jabbok is outdone by Kedron. His was a wrestling,
          not to sweat alone, but unto sweat of blood: he sweats who works for
          bread, the staff of life; but He sweats blood who works for life
          itself. What prayers those must have been under such a fearful
          physical, mental, and spiritual agony which were so fervent that they
          brought an angel from the throne, and yet so submissive that they are
          the model of resignation. He agonized as earnestly as if He sought His
          own will, and yet He wholly resigned Himself to the Father, saying,
          |Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight
          to do thy will, O my God.| Our Lord was always praying: there never
          was a moment in His life in which He was not in full communion with
          God, unless we except the period when He cried, |Why hast thou
          forsaken me?| He did often go aside to pray a more special prayer, but
          yet even when He spoke to the people, even when He faced His foes, His
          soul was still in constant fellowship with His Father. But ah, when He
          came between the upper and the nether millstones, when this good olive
          was ground in the olive press, and all the oil of His life was
          extracted from Him, then it was that His strong crying and tears came
          up before the Lord His God, and He was heard in that He feared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brothers and sisters, look at your pattern, and see how far short
          you have come of it. At least, I will remember with regret how far
          short I have come of it. Have we waited? Have we not been in too great
          a hurry? Has it not been too much our desire that the Lord might make
          His will like our will rather than make our will like His? Have you
          not had a will of your own sometimes, and a strong will too? Have you
          not been as the bullock unaccustomed to the yoke? Have you not kicked
          against the pricks? You have not waited, but you have worried. Can we
          say that we waited patiently? Oh, that patience! Every man thinks he
          has it until he needs it, but only let his tender point be touched,
          and you will see how little patience he possesses. It is the fire
          which tires our supposed resignation, and under that process much of
          our palace of patience burns like wood, hay, and stubble. Old crosses
          fit the shoulder, but let a new cross be laid upon us and we writhe
          under it. Suffering is the vocation of a Christian, but most of us
          come short of our high calling. Our Lord Jesus has joined together
          reigning and suffering, for we read of |the kingdom and patience of
          Jesus Christ|; He was the royal example of patience, but what are we?
          Remember, again, that Jesus prayed importunately while He waited:
          |being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly.| Have we not at time
          restrained prayer? Have we not pleaded as an excuse for our feeble
          petitions the very facts which ought to have been a spur to our
          earnestness? |I felt too ill to pray.| Coldest thou not pray for
          health with all the more fervency? |I felt too burdened to pray.|
          Shouldst thou not pray for help to bear thy burden? Can we ever safely
          say to ourselves, |I may be excused from supplication now, for my
          sorrow is great.| Talk not so. Here is thy balm and benediction, thy
          comfort and thy cordial: here is thy strength and succor, thy
          constancy and confidence. Even in the midnight of the soul let us
          arise and pour out our hearts like water before the Lord. O tried
          believer, get thee to thy knees, and from above the mercy-seat the
          glory of the Lord shall shine forth upon thee. Pray even as Jesus did,
          and as all His saints have done, so shall you in patience possess your
          soul. In due time the Lord inclined to the afflicted suppliant,
          listening to his moaning from the bottom of the pit; of this it is
          high time for us to speak. Yet let us not leave this first point till
          we learn from the example of our Lord that patience is seen in waiting
          as well as in suffering. To bear a great weight for an hour or two is
          nothing compared with carrying a load for many a day. Patience knows
          its letters, but waiting reads the page, and praying rehearses it in
          the ears of God. Let us add to our patience waiting, and to waiting
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We come, secondly, to consider OUR LORD'S DELIVERANCE. In due
          time, when patience had had her perfect work, and prayer had at last
          prevailed, our suffering Lord was brought up again from the deeps of
          sorrow. His deliverance is set forth under two images.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is represented as a bringing up out of a horrible pit. It is
          a terribly suggestive metaphor. I have been in the dungeon in Rome in
          which, according to tradition, Peter and Paul were confined (though,
          probably, they were never there at all). It was indeed a horrible pit,
          for originally it had no entrance but a round hole in the rock above;
          and when that round hole at the top was blocked with a stone, not a
          ray of light nor a particle of fresh air could possibly enter. The
          prisoners were let down into the cavern, and there they were left.
          When once the opening was closed they were cut off from all
          communication with their fellow men. No being has ever been so cruel
          to man as man. Man is the worst of monsters to his kind, and his cruel
          inventions are many. He has not been content to leave his fellows
          their natural liberty, but he built prisons and digged pits in which
          to shut up his victims. At first they would place a man in a dry well
          merely for custody and confinement, or they would drop him into some
          hollow cavern in the earth in which corn or treasure had been
          concealed; but afterwards with greater ingenuity of malice they
          covered over the top of these pits so that the prisoners could not be
          partakers of God's bountiful air, or the merciful light of the sun, or
          the silver sheen of the moon. Covered all over and shut in, the
          captives were buried alive. Even in modern times we have seen what
          they call oubliettes, or dungeons in which prisoners were immured, to
          be forgotten as dead men out of mind, buried so as never to come forth
          again. Such unfortunates as were doomed to enter these tombs of living
          men bade farewell to hope. They were inhabitants of oblivion, dwellers
          in the land of death shade, to remain apart from their kind, cut off
          from memory. These worst of dungeons may illustrate our text -- |He
          brought me up also out of a horrible pit.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In the original we get the idea of a crash, as when some mailed
          warrior in the midst of the battle stumbles into a pit, and there he
          lies bruised and broken: and there is the thought of the fall of
          waters rushing strangely, furiously, mysteriously. The Hebrew hath it,
          |The pit of noises,| or as some render it, |the pit of destruction.|
          Such was the condition of our dear Redeemer when He was bearing our
          sin and suffering in our stead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just notice, first, that our Lord was like a man put into a pit, and
          so made to be quite alone. Imagine yourself now confined in one of
          those caverns, with the big stone rolled over the mouth of it. There
          would be neither hearing nor answering. Now will you know the dread
          solemnity of silence. You may speak, but no gentle whisper of sympathy
          will reach your ears in return; you may cry again and again and make
          the dungeon's dome echo to your voice, but you are speaking as to
          brass -- no man cares for your soul. You are alone; alone in a fearful
          solitude. Thus it happened to our Saviour. All His disciples forsook
          Him and fled, and what was infinitely worse, His God forsook Him too.
          He cried, |My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?| Can any man
          tell me all that was meant by that infinite lament?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a prisoner in such a pit as that was in total darkness. He
          could not see the walls which enclosed him, nor so much as his own
          hand. No beam of sunlight ever wandered into that stagnant air; the
          captive would have to grope for the pitcher of water and the morsel of
          bread which a cruel mercy would allot to him. Our Lord was in the
          dark; midnight brooded over His spirit. He said -- |Now is my soul
          troubled.| |My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.| His was a
          pit of gloom, the region of the shadow of death, a land of darkness as
          darkness itself
        </p>
        <p>
          When a man is shut up in a pit he is, of course, full of distress. If
          you were, any of you, to go into one of the solitary cells of our own
          jails, I warrant you a short sojourn in it would be quite enough.
          These cells some years ago were thought to be wonderful cures for all
          sort of evil dispositions in men, but probably they have oftener
          destroyed reason than conquered depravity. Go in, if you dare. Ask the
          warder to shut to the door, and leave you in the dark all alone, that
          you may try the solitary system for yourself. No, I should not advise
          you to try it even for five minutes, for you might even in that short
          pace inflict such an injury upon your nervous system as you would
          never recover. I believe that many of the gentler ones here would be
          quite unable to bear total darkness and solitude even for the shortest
          space. In the grim gloom the soul is haunted with phantom fears, while
          horror peoples the place which is empty of human beings; the heart is
          worried with evil imaginations, and pierced with arrows of distress;
          grief takes hold of the spirit, and alarm conquers hope. In our Lord's
          case, the grief and sorrow which He felt can never be described, nor
          need it be conceived. It was something tantamount to the miseries of
          damned souls. The holy Jesus could not feel the exact misery which
          takes hold on abandoned rebels, but He did suffer what was tantamount
          to that at the judgment -- seat of God. He gave a quid pro quo, a
          something which in God's esteem, reckoning the dignity of His mighty
          person, stood instead of the sinner's eternal suffering. He felt woe
          upon woe, night blackening night. Do not try to realize His agony; He
          wills that you should note, for He has trodden the winepress alone,
          and of the people there we're none with Him, as if to show that none
          could understand His sorrows, and that we can do no more than speak of
          His |unknown sufferings.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must add, to complete the figure, that shut up in such a pit
          there might be a great tumult above, like to the tramping of armed
          hosts, or there might be a rush of waters underneath the captive deep
          in earth's bowels. He could not tell what the noise was, nor whence it
          came; and hence he would often be in terrible fear while he sat alone
          in the thick darkness. Our lord had His fears, for we read that He was
          heard in that He feared. Torrents of sin rushed near Him; floods of
          wrath were heard around Him, and cataracts of grief fell upon Him.
          Besides, there was a mystery about this anguish which intensified it
          -- a mystery not to be written or explained. Our Redeemer's spirit was
          cast down within Him far beyond anything that is common to men; in
          that horrible pit, that pit of destruction, He lay with none to pity
          or sustain.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, Oh, change the strain, and sing unto the Lord awhile, as we read
          the verse, |He brought me up out of a horrible pit.| The Lord Jesus
          Christ was lifted up from all sorrow of spirit at that moment when He
          said so bravely, |It is finished,| and though He died yet was He
          lifted up from death, as it is written, |Thou wilt not leave my soul
          in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.|
          His Spirit ascended to God, and by-and-by, when the third day had
          blushed with morning light, His body rose from the tomb, to ascend in
          due time to glory. He came up out of the pit of the grave, delivered
          from all fear of corruption, pain, or defeat. Now His sorrow is ended,
          and His brow is clear from care. His visage is marred no more: He
          bears the scars which do but illumine His hands and feet with
          splendor, but
        </p>
        <p>No more the bloody spear,</p>
        <p>The cross and nails no more,</p>
        <p>For hell itself shakes at his name,</p>
        <p>And all the heavens adore.</p>
        <p>
          Sing ye unto the Lord, ye saints of His, as ye behold your Master
          brought up again from among the sorrowful, the despised, the deserted,
          the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second figure is, however, used here to express our Lord's grief and
          deliverance from it -- |Out of the miry clay.| Travelers tell us that
          wherever pits are still used as dungeons, they are damp, foul and
          utterly loathsome; for they are never cleansed, however long the
          prisoner may have been there, or however great the number of victims
          shut up within them. You know what the prisons of Europe were in
          Howard's days, they were even worse in the East in periods further
          back. The imprisoned wretch often found himself sinking in more; he
          found no rest, no hope of comfort, and when extricated he needed a
          hand to drag him out of the thick clay. Our blessed Lord and Master
          found Himself when He was suffering for us where everything appeared
          to give way beneath Him; His spirits sank, His friends failed Him, and
          His heart melted like wax. Every comfort was taken from Him. His
          blessed manhood found nothing upon this earth upon which it could stay
          itself, for He had been made sin for us, made a curse for us, and so
          every foundation of comfort departed from Him. He was deprived of
          visible support, and reduced to a sad condition. As a man who has
          fallen into a slough cannot stir so as to recover himself, so was it
          with our Redeemer, who says in the Psalms -- |I sink in deep mire,
          where there is no standing.| Some morasses are so destructive that, if
          a man should once fall into them, he might give up his life for lost
          unless some one came that way to drag him out. So did the Saviour sink
          in the miry clay of our sin and misery until the Lord Almighty lifted
          Him out. The clay of sorrow clung to Him; it held to Him while He was
          performing the great work of our redemption. But the Lord brought Him
          up out of it. There is no mire upon His garments now: his feet no
          longer sink, He is not held by the bands of death, He slides not into
          the grave again. He was dragged down, as it were, by hearing our sin,
          but that is over, and He hath ascended on high: He hath led captivity
          captive, and received gifts from men. All honor be unto Him, and to
          His Father who delivered Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we read our text we pursue this story of out Master's deliverance,
          and we are told that He was brought up out of the lowest deeps. Say
          the words or sing them as you choose -- |He brought me up.| God
          upraised His obedient Son from the depths into which He had descended
          on our account. He was brought up, like Jonah who went to die bottom
          of the mountains, and yet was landed safely on the shore. He was
          brought up like Joseph, who rose from a pit to a palace; like David,
          who was led up from the sheepfold to the kingdom. |The king shall joy
          in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he
          rejoice! His glory is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast
          thou laid upon him. For thou hast made him most blessed forever: Thou
          hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we are told He was set on a rock, and oh, the glory of our
          blessed Lord in this matter, for now He stands on a firm foundation in
          all that He does for us. Judgment and truth confirm His ways, and the
          Judge of all the earth approves His doings. Christ has no sandy
          foundation for His work of mercy or His word of comfort. When He saves
          He has a right to save: when He puts away sin He does it on
          indisputable grounds: when He helps and delivers His people He does it
          according to law, according to the will of the Highest. As Justifier,
          Preserver, and Perfecter of His people, He stands upon a rock. This
          day I delight to think of my Lord as settling His church with Himself
          upon the immutable foundations of the covenant, on the decree of God,
          on the purpose of the Father, on His own work, and on the promise of
          God that He would reward Him in that work. Well may we say that His
          feet are upon a rock, for He is Himself, by another figure, the Rock
          of ages, the Rock of our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now the goings of our glorious Christ are established. When He
          goes out to save a sinner, He knows that He can do it, and has a right
          to do it. When He goes up to His Father's throne to make intercession
          for sinners, His goings are established, and the desire of His heart
          is given Him. When He comes in among His church, or marches forth with
          his people to the ends of the earth, His goings are established. |For
          the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High
          he shall not be moved.| He shall surely come a second time without sin
          unto salvation, for so has the Father decreed: His glorious goings are
          as surely established as were those of His labor and suffering. We
          shall never be without a Saviour: we shall never have a fallen or a
          vanquished Saviour; for His goings are established for continuance,
          certainty, and victory. Such honor have all His saints; for |the steps
          of a good man are ordered of the Lord|; and again, |none of his steps
          shall slide.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Best of all, there is a new, song in the mouth of our Well-beloved. It
          is grand to think of Jesus singing. Read the twenty-second Psalm, and
          you will find Him doing it, as also in the Hebrews: |In the midst of
          the church will I sing praise unto thee.| Toward the end of His
          earthly career you hear Him bursting into song. Was not that a grand
          occasion just before His passion, when He was going out to die; we
          read that |after supper they sang a hymn.| If we had been bound to die
          that night, as He was, we should rather have wept or prayed than sang.
          Not so our Lord. I do not know what psalm they sang: probably a part
          of the great Hallel, usually sung after the Passover, which consists
          of those Psalms at the end of the book which are so full of praise. I
          believe the Saviour Himself pitched the tune and led the strain. Think
          of Him singing when near His hour of agony! Going to scorn and
          mockery, singing! Going to the thorn-crown and the scourge, singing!
          Going to death, even the death of the cross, singing! For the joy that
          was set before Him He endured the cross, despising the shame! But now,
          what must that new song be which He leads in heaven? |They sang, as it
          were, a new song before the throne|; but it is He that leads the
          heavenly orchestra. How greatly He excels Miriam, the sister of Moses,
          when she took her timbrel and led forth the women in their dances,
          saying, |Sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the
          horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.| This is called |the
          song of Moses, the servant of God and of the Lamb|; so I gather that
          the Lamb's new song is after the same triumphant fashion: it is the
          substance of that which Moses' song foreshadowed. In Christ Jesus the
          Lord our God has led captivity captive. Let us praise Him on the high
          sounding cymbals. Sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed
          gloriously. The powers of darkness are destroyed; sin, death, and hell
          are drowned in the atoning blood: the depths have covered them: there
          is not one of them left. Oh, |sing unto the Lord, for he hath
          triumphed gloriously.| |Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Such is the exalted condition of our Lord at this hour; let us
          turn and look upon THE LORD'S REWARD. The Lord's reward for having
          gone down into the horrible pit, and having gunk in the miry clay for
          us, is this -- that |Many shall see, and fear, and trust in the Lord.
          |Many!| Not all mankind, but |many| shall look to Jesus and live.
          Alas! Vast numbers continue in unbelief, but |many' shall believe and
          live; and the Lord's |many| means very many. As I was thinking over my
          text, I thought, |I hope there will be some at the Tabernacle this
          morning that belong to the I many who shall see and fear and trust in
          the Lord.| |Many shall| for the Lord hath promised it. But, Lord, they
          will not. |But they shall,| says God. Oh, but many refuse. |But they
          shall,| says God and He hath the key of men's hearts, and power over
          their judgments and their wills. |Many shall.| Do you, oh ye
          unbelievers, think that Jesus shall die in vain? Oh, sinners, if you
          will nor have Christ, others will. You may despise Him, but He will be
          none the less glorious. You may reject His salvation but He shall be
          none the less mighty to save. He is a king, and ye cannot pluck a
          single jewel from His crown. If you arc so foolish as to provoke His
          iron rod so that He shall break you in shivers with it, yet He will be
          ijorious in the sight of God, and He will save His own.
          Notwithstanding your hardness of heart, be this known unto you, oh
          House of Israel, that |many shall see, and fear, and trust in the
          Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          What shall the many do? They shall |see.| Their eyes shall be opened,
          and they shall see their Lord in the horrible pit, and in the miry
          clay, and as they look they shall see that He was there for them. What
          joy this will create in their spirits! If they do not see the Lord
          Jesus as their Substitute they shall, at any rate, be made to see the
          exceeding sinfulness of sin. If when Jesus only takes imputed sin, and
          has no sin of His own, yet He must be cast into the horrible pit and
          sink in the miry clay; then what will become of men who have their
          owns sins about them, provoking the fierce anger of the Lord? If God
          thus smites His well -- beloved, oh sinner, how will He smite you!
          Beware, ye that forget Him, lest He tear you in pieces, and there be
          none to deliver you. By the suffering Surety all covered with His own
          gore, I do beseech you, provoke not God; for if His Only -- Begotten
          must suffer so, you must suffer yet more if you break His law, and
          next reject His gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Many shall see.| Do you wonder that it is added, |and shall fear?| It
          makes men fear to see a bleeding Christ, and to know that they
          crucified Him. It makes men fear, however, with a sweet filial fear
          that is akin to hope, when they see that Jesus died for sinner, the
          Just for the unjust, to bring them to God. Oh, when they see the Lord
          of love acting as a scapegoat, and bearing their sins away into the
          wilderness of forgetfulness, they begin to hate their evil ways, and
          to have a reverent fear of God; for so saith the Scripture, |there is
          forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But best of all -- and this is the chief point -- they come to |trust
          in the Lord.| They build their hope of salvation upon the
          righteousness of God as manifested in Christ Jesus. Oh, I would to God
          that some of you would trust Him at once. Beloved friend, are you
          trying to be saved by your own works? That is a delusion. Are you
          hoping to be saved by your own feelings? That is a lie. But you can be
          saved, you shall be saved: if you will trust yourself with that
          blessed One who was alone in the dark pit of noises for the sake of
          sinners, and slipped in the miry clay for the ungodly, you shall
          assuredly be saved from wrath through Him. Trust Him, and as surely as
          He liveth you shall be saved; for he that trusteth in Him cannot
          perish. God's truthfulness were gone if the believer could be lost.
          Hath He not said, |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.|
          The throne of God must rock and reel before the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Fourthly, let us see THE LORD'S LIKENESS in His people. This whole
          passage, as I said in the beginning, has often been used by individual
          believers as a description of their own deliverance. It is a true
          picture, because we are made like unto our Head, and all the brethren
          are partakers of that which the Head has endured. Do I speak to any of
          my Master's servants in sore trouble? Dear friends, are you made to
          wait, though your trial is sharp and severe? Is it so that your prayer
          has not yet been answered? Then remember the waiter's place was once
          occupied by the Lord Jesus, for He says, |I waited patiently.| If the
          Lord keeps you waiting for a certain blessing year after year do not
          despair. He will give it at length if it be truly for your good, for
          He hath said, |no good thing will I withhold from them that walk
          uprightly.| He kept His Son waiting, and He may very well keep you in
          like posture, for how long did you delay, and cause the Lord of grace
          to wait on you! |Blessed are they that wait for Him.| I have seen
          people very uppish when they have called on a public man and have had
          to wait a little; they feel that they ought not to be kept in the
          lobby, but suppose some young man said to them, |I am his own son, and
          yet I have been waiting an hour.| Then they are more patient. So when
          God keeps you waiting do not be proud, and say, |Wherefore should I
          wait for the Lord any longer?| but remember |It is good for a man both
          to hope and quietly wait for the salvation of God.| Jesus waited --
          |waited patiently.| Seek to be like Him, and in patience possess your
          soul. |I cannot see how I am to be delivered.| Wait. |Ah, this is such
          a heavy burden.| Wait. |But I am ready to die under this terrible
          load.| Wait! Wait on! Though He tarry, wait for Him: He is worth
          waiting for. |Wait| is a short word, but it takes a deal of grace to
          spell out its full meaning, and still more grace to put it in
          practice. Wait: wait. |Oh, but I have been unfortunate.| Wait. |But I
          have believed a promise, and it has not been fulfilled.| Wait; for you
          wait in blessed company: you may hear Jesus saying, |I waited
          patiently.| Blessed be His name, He is teaching us to do the same by
          His gracious Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, the Lord may send you, His dear child, a very heavy sorrow: you
          may fall into the horrible pit, and see no light, no comfort, and no
          one may be able to cheer you or help you. Some that have a touch of
          despondency in their nature have been brought so low as almost to
          despair of life. They have sat in darkness and seen no light: they
          have felt the walls of their prison and have not discovered a crack or
          cranny through which escape was possible: they have looked up, and
          even then they have seen nothing to console them. Ah, well, here is a
          word I commend to you -- the Saviour says it: |He brought me up.| The
          Lord God can and will bring up His troubled ones. You will have to
          write in your dairy one of these days. |He brought me up.| I was in
          the dark, I was in the dungeon, but |He brought me up.| I can
          personally say this with gladsome gratitude, for He hath brought me
          up,| again and again. My heart is glad as I reflect upon my past
          deliverances. I have often wondered why I so often shut up in prison,
          and bound as with fetters of steel; but I cease to wonder when I think
          of the many among you who are called to wear the like bonds. This is
          my portion, that I may be a witness-bearer for my God, and that I may
          be able to speak to the experiences of God's tempted people, and tell
          how graciously the Lord delivers His servants who trust in Him. Faith
          shall never be shamed or confounded, world without end. God can and
          will hasten to the rescue of the faithful. I set to my seal also that
          |He brought me up|; and, beloved brother in tribulation, He will bring
          you up; only rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Ah,| say you, |But I do not know how to stand, for I sink as in miry
          clay, through faintness of heart: I cannot find the slightest foothold
          for my hope.| No, you are sinking in the miry clay like your Master;
          but in answer to prayer the Lord will bring you up out of your
          hopeless state, and He will set your feet upon a rock and establish
          your goings, and give you joy, and peace, and delight. Wherefore see,
          and fear, and trust in God, and give glory to His blessed name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, do I address any seeking one who finds no rest for the sole of
          his foot? Dear friend, are you sinking in the deep mire of your guilt?
          The Lord can pardon you, for |the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
          cleanseth us from all sin.| Are you shut up by conscience in the
          prison-house under a just sense of deserved wrath? Jesus will give you
          immediate rest if you come to Him. Do you feel as if you cannot kneel
          to pray, for your very knees slip in the mire of doubt? Remember,
          Jesus makes intercession for the transgressors. Do you seem as if,
          every time you move, you are burying your hope, and slipping deeper
          and deeper into ruin? The Lord hath plenteous redemption. Do not
          despairs You cannot not deliver yourself, but God can deliver you: you
          cannot stand of yourself, but God can make you to stand. You cannot go
          to Him nor go abroad among your fellow-men with comfort, but the Lord
          can make you to run in His ways. You shall yet go forth with joy and
          be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth
          before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap
          their hands. Only see Christ, and fear and trust your God, and you too
          shall sing unto Jehovah your deliverer, and this shall be your song:

        <p>He raised mc from a horrid pit,</p>
        <p>Where mourning long I lay,</p>
        <p>And from my bonds released my feet,</p>
        <p>Deep bonds of miry clay.</p>
        <p>Firm on a rock he made me stand,</p>
        <p>And taught my cheerful tongue</p>
        <p>I praise tire wonders of his hand</p>
        <p>In a new thankful song.</p>
