        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.4)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 21, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
          that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom
          the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
          him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.|
          -- John 14:16-17
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be surprised to hear me announce that I do not intend this
          morning to say anything about the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. I
          propose to reserve that for a special Sermon this evening. In this
          discourse I shall endeavor to explain and enforce certain other
          doctrines, which I believe are plainly taught in this text, and which
          I hope God the Holy Ghost may make profitable to our souls. Old John
          Newton once said, that there were some books which he could not read;
          -- they were good and sound enough; but, said he, |they are books of
          halfpence; -- you have to take so much in quantity before you have any
          value; there are other books of silver, and others of gold; but I have
          one book that is a book of bank notes; and every leaf is a bank-note
          of immense value.| So I found with this text: that I had a bank-note
          of so large a sum, that I could not tell it out all this morning. I
          should have to keep you several hours before I could unfold to you the
          whole value of this precious promise -- one of the last which Christ
          gave his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite your attention to this passage because we shall find in it
          some instruction on four points: first, concerning the true and proper
          personality of the Holy Ghost; secondly, concerning the united agency
          of the glorious Three Persons in the work of our salvation; thirdly we
          shall find something to establish the doctrine of the indwelling of
          the Holy Ghost in the souls of all believers; and fourthly, we shall
          find out the reason why the carnal mind rejects the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, we shall have some little instruction concerning the
          proper personality of the Holy Spirit. We are so much accustomed to
          talk about the influence of the Holy Ghost and his sacred operations
          and graces, that we are apt to forget that the Holy Spirit is truly
          and actually a person -- that he is a subsistence -- an existence; or,
          as we Trinitarians usually say, one person in the essence of the
          Godhead. I am afraid that, though we do not know it, we have acquired
          the habit of regarding the Holy Ghost as an emanation flowing from the
          Father and the Son, but not as being actually a person himself. I know
          it is not easy to carry about in our mind the idea of the Holy Spirit
          as a person. I can think of the Father as a person, because his acts
          are such as I can understand. I see him hang the world in ether; I
          behold him swaddling a new-born sea in bands of darkness; I know it is
          he who formed the drops of hail, who leadeth forth the stars by their
          hosts, and calleth them by their name; I can conceive of Him as a
          person, because I behold his operations. I can realize Jesus, the Son
          of Man, as a real person, because he is bone of my bone and flesh of
          my flesh. It takes no great stretch of my imagination to picture the
          babe in Bethlehem, or to behold the |Man of sorrows and acquainted
          with grief,| of the king of martyrs, as he was persecuted in Pilate's
          hall, or nailed to the accursed tree for our sins. Nor do I find it
          difficult at times to realize the person of my Jesus sitting on his
          throne in heaven; or girt with clouds and wearing the diadem of all
          creation, calling the earth to judgment, and summoning us to hear our
          final sentence. But when I come to deal with the Holy Ghost, his
          operations are so mysterious, his doings are so secret, his acts are
          so removed from everything that is of sense, and of the body, that I
          cannot so easily get the idea of his being a person; but a person he
          is. God the Holy Ghost is not an influence, an emanation, a stream of
          something flowing from the Father; but he is as much an actual person
          as either God the Son, or God the Father. I shall attempt this morning
          a little to establish the doctrine, and to show you the truth of it --
          that God the Holy Spirit is actually a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first proof we shall gather from the pool of holy baptism. Let me
          take you down, as I have taken others, into the pool, now concealed,
          but which I wish were always open to your view. Let me take you to the
          baptismal font, where believers put on the name of the Lord Jesus, and
          you shall hear me pronounce the solemn words, |I baptize thee in the
          name,| -- mark, |in the name,| not names -- |of the Father, and of the
          Son, and of the Holy Ghost.| Every one who is baptized according to
          the true form laid down in Scripture, must be a Trinitarian: otherwise
          his baptism is a farce and a lie, and he himself is found a deceiver
          and a hypocrite before God. As the Father is mentioned, and as the Son
          is mentioned, so is the Holy Ghost; and the whole is summed up as
          being a Trinity in unity, by its being said, not the names, but the
          |name| the glorious name, the Jehovah name, |of the Father, and of the
          Son, and of the Holy Ghost.| Let me remind you that the same thing
          occurs each time you are dismissed from this house of prayer. In
          pronouncing the solemn closing benediction, we invoke on your behalf
          the love of Jesus Christ, the grace of the Father, and the fellowship
          of the Holy Spirit; and thus, according to the apostolic manner, we
          make a manifest distinction between the persons, showing that we
          believe the Father to be a person, the Son to be a person, and the
          Holy Ghost to be a person. Were there no other proofs in Scripture, I
          think these would be sufficient for every sensible man. He would see
          that if the Holy Spirit were a mere influence, he would not be
          mentioned in conjunction with two whom we all confess to be actual and
          proper persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          A second argument arises from the fact that the Holy Ghost has
          actually made different appearances on earth. The Great Spirit has
          manifested himself to man: he has put on a form, so that, whilst he
          has not been beheld by mortal men, he has been so veiled in appearance
          that he was seen, so far as that appearance was concerned, by the eyes
          of all beholders. See you Jesus Christ our Saviour? There is the river
          Jordan, with its shelving banks and its willows weeping at its side.
          Jesus Christ, the Son of God, descends into the stream, and the holy
          Baptist, John, plunges him into the waves. The doors of heaven are
          opened; a miraculous appearance presents itself; a bright light
          shineth from the sky, brighter than the sun in all its grandeur, and
          down in a flood of glory descends something which you recognize to be
          a dove. It rests on Jesus -- it sits upon his sacred head, and as the
          old painters put a halo round the brow of Jesus, so did the Holy Ghost
          shed a resplendence around the face of him who came to fulfil all
          righteousness, and therefore commenced with the ordinance of baptism.
          The Holy Ghost was seen as a dove, to mark his purity and his
          gentleness, and he came down like a dove from heaven to show that it
          is from heaven alone that he descendeth. Nor is this the only time
          when the Holy Ghost has been manifest in a visible shape. You see that
          company of disciples gathered together in an upper room; they are
          waiting for some promised blessing, and bye-and-bye it shall come.
          Hark! there is a sound as of a rushing mighty wind; it fills all the
          house where they are sitting; and astonished, they look around them,
          wondering what will come next. Soon a bright light appears, shining
          upon the heads of each: cloven tongues of fire sat upon them. What
          were these marvelous appearances of wind and flame but a display of
          the Holy Ghost in his proper person? I say the fact of an appearance
          manifests that he must be a person. An influence could not appear --
          an attribute could not appear: we cannot see attributes -- we cannot
          behold influences. The Holy Ghost must, then, have been a person;
          since he was beheld by mortal eyes, and he came under the cognizance
          of mortal sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another proof is from the fact, that personal qualities are, in
          Scripture, ascribed to the Holy Ghost. First, let me read to you a
          text in which the Holy Ghost is spoken of as having understanding. In
          the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians, chap. ii., you will read, |But as
          it is written, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it
          entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepare for
          them that love him. But God have revealed them unto us by his Spirit:
          for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For
          what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is
          in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
          God.| Here you see an understanding -- a power of knowledge is
          ascribed to the Holy Ghost. Now, if there be any persons here whose
          minds are of so preposterous a complexion that they would ascribe one
          attribute to another, and would speak of a mere influence having
          understanding, then I give up all the argument. But I believe every
          rational man will admit, that when anything is spoken of as having an
          understanding, it must be an existence -- it must, in fact, be a
          person. In the 12th chap., 11th verse of the same Epistle, you will
          find a will ascribed to the Holy Spirit. |But all these worketh that
          one and the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he
          will.| So it is plain that the Spirit has a will. He does not come
          from God simply at God's will, but he has a will of his own, which is
          always in keeping with the will of the infinite Jehovah, but is,
          nevertheless, distinct and separate; therefore, I say he is a person.
          In another text, power is ascribed to the Holy Ghost, and power is a
          thing which can only be ascribed to an existence. In Romans 15:13, it
          is written, |Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
          believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy
          Ghost.| I need not insist upon it, because it is self-evident, that
          wherever you find understanding, will, and power, you must also find
          an existence; it cannot be a mere attribute, it cannot be a metaphor,
          it cannot be a personified influence; but it must be a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have a proof which, perhaps, will be more telling upon you than
          any other. Acts and deeds are ascribed to the Holy Ghost; therefore,
          he must be a person. You read in the first chapter of the Book of
          Genesis, that the Spirit brooded over the surface of the earth, when
          it was as yet all disorder and confusion. This world was once a mass
          of chaotic matter, there was no order; it was like the valley of
          darkness and of the shadow of death. God the Holy Ghost spread his
          wings over it; he sowed the seeds of life in it; the germs from which
          all beings sprang were implanted by him; he impregnated the earth so
          that it became capable of life. Now, it must have been a person who
          brought order out of confusion: it must have been an existence who
          hovered over this world and made it what it now is. But do we not read
          in Scripture something more of the Holy Ghost? Yes, we are told that
          |holy men of old spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.| When
          Moses penned the Pentateuch, the Holy Ghost moved his hand; when David
          wrote the Psalms, and discoursed sweet music on his harp, it was the
          Holy Spirit that gave his fingers their seraphic motion; when Solomon
          dropped from his lips the words of the proverbs of wisdom, or when he
          hymned the Canticles of love, it was the Holy Ghost who gave him words
          of knowledge and hymns of rapture. Ah! and what fire was that which
          touched the lips of the eloquent Isaiah? What hand was that which came
          upon Daniel? What might was that which made Jeremiah so plaintive in
          his grief? or what was that which winged Ezekiel and made him like an
          eagle, soar into mysteries aloft, and see the mighty unknown beyond
          our reach? Who was it that made Amos, the herdsman, a prophet? Who
          taught the rugged Haggai to pronounce his thundering sentences? Who
          showed Habakkuk the horses of Jehovah marching through the waters? or
          who kindled the burning eloquence of Nahum? Who caused Malachi to
          close up the book with the muttering of the word curse? Who was it in
          each of these, save the Holy Ghost? And must it not have been a person
          who spake in and through these ancient witnesses? We must believe it.
          We cannot avoid believing it, when we read that |holy men of old spake
          as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And when has the Holy Ghost ceased to have an influence upon men? We
          find that still he deals with his ministers and with all his saints.
          Turn to the Acts, and you will find that the Holy Ghost said,
          |Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work.| I never heard of an
          attribute saying such a thing. The Holy Spirit said to Peter, |Go to
          the Centurion, and what I have cleansed, that call not thou common.|
          The Holy Ghost caught away Philip after he had baptized the Eunuch,
          and carried him away to another place; and the Holy Ghost said to
          Paul; |Thou shalt not go into that city, but shall turn into another.|
          And we know that the Holy Ghost was lied unto by Ananias and Sapphira,
          when it was said, |Thou hast not lied unto man, but unto God.| Again,
          that power which we feel every day, who are called to preach -- that
          wondrous spell which makes our lips so potent -- that power which
          gives us thoughts which are like birds from a far-off region, not the
          natives of our soul -- that influence which I sometimes strangely
          feel, which, if it does not give me poetry and eloquence, gives me a
          might I never felt before, and lifts me above my fellow-man -- that
          majesty with which he clothes his ministers, till in the midst of the
          battle they cry aha! like the war-horse of Job, and move themselves
          like leviathans in the water -- that power which gives us might over
          men, and causes them to sit and listen as if their ears were chained,
          as if they were entranced by the power of some magician's wand -- that
          power must come from a person; it must come from the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          But is it not said in Scripture, and do we not feel it, dear brethren,
          that it is the Holy Ghost who regenerates the soul? It is the Holy
          Ghost who quickens us. |You hath he quickened who were dead in
          trespasses and sins.| It is the Holy Spirit who imparts the first germ
          of life, convincing us of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment to
          come. And is it not the Holy Spirit, who, after that flame is kindled,
          still fans it with the breath of his mouth and keeps it alive? Its
          author is its preserver. Oh! can it be said that it is the Holy Ghost
          who strives in men's souls; that it is the Holy Ghost who brings them
          into the sweet place that is called Calvary -- can it be said that he
          does all these things, and yet is not a person? It may be said, but it
          must be said by fools; for he never can be a wise man who can consider
          these things can be done by any other than a glorious person -- a
          divine existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me to give you one more proof, and I shall have done. Certain
          feelings are ascribed to the Holy Ghost, which can only be understood
          upon the supposition that he is actually a person. In the 4th chapter
          of Ephesians, v.30, it is said that the Holy Ghost can be grieved:
          |Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
          of redemption.| In Isaiah, chap. lxiii, v.10, it is said that the Holy
          Ghost can be vexed: |But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit;
          therefore he was turned to be their enemy., and he fought against
          them.| In Acts, chap. vii. v.51, you read that the Holy Ghost can be
          resisted: |Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
          always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.| And in
          the 5th chapter, v.9, of the same book, you will find that the Holy
          Ghost may be tempted. We are informed that Peter said to Ananias and
          Sapphira, |How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit
          of the Lord?| Now, these things could not be emotions which might be
          ascribed to a quality or an emanation; they must be understood to
          relate to a person; an influence could not be grieved, it must be a
          person who can be grieved, vexed, or resisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear brethren, I think I have fully established the point of
          the personality of the Holy Ghost; allow me now, most earnestly, to
          impress upon you the absolute necessity of being sound on the doctrine
          of the Trinity. I knew a man, a good minister of Jesus Christ he is
          now, and I believe he was before he turned his eyes unto heresy -- he
          began to doubt the glorious divinity of our blessed Lord, and for
          years did he preach the heterodox doctrine, until one day he happened
          to hear a very eccentric old minister preaching from the text, |But
          there the glorious Lord shall be unto us a place of broad rivers and
          streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant
          ship pass thereby. Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well
          strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail.| |Now,| said
          the old minister, |you give up the Trinity, and your tacklings are
          loosed, you cannot strengthen your masts. Once give up the doctrine of
          three persons, and your tacklings are all gone; your mast, which ought
          to be a support to your vessel, is a rickety one, and shakes.| A
          gospel without the Trinity! it is a pyramid built upon its apex. A
          gospel without the Trinity! it is a rope of sand that cannot hold
          together. A gospel without the Trinity! then, indeed, Satan can
          overturn it. But give me a gospel with the Trinity, and the might of
          hell cannot prevail against it; no man can any more overthrow it than
          a bubble could split a rock, or a feather break in halves a mountain.
          Get the thought of the three persons, and you have the marrow of all
          divinity. Only know the Father, and know the Son, and know the Holy
          Ghost to be one, and all things will appear clear. This is the golden
          key to the secrets of nature; this is the silken clue of the
          labyrinths of mystery, and he who understands this, will soon
          understand as much as mortals e'er can know.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now for our second point -- the united agency of the three persons
          in the work of our salvation. Look at the text, and you will find all
          the three persons mentioned. |I| -- that is the Son -- |will pray the
          Father, and he shall give you another Comforter.| There are the three
          persons mentioned, all of them doing something for our salvation. |I
          will pray,| says the Son. |I will send,| says the Father. |I will
          comfort,| says the Holy Ghost. now, let us, for a few moments,
          discourse upon this wondrous theme -- the unity of the three persons
          with regard to the great purpose of the salvation of the elect. When
          God first made man, he said, |Let us make man,| not let me, but, |Let
          us make man in our own image.| The covenant Elohim said to each other,
          |Let us unitedly become the creator of man.| So, when in ages far gone
          by, in eternity, they said, |Let us save man:| it was not the Father
          who said, |Let me save man, |but the three persons conjointly said,
          with one consent, |Let us save man.| It is to me a source of sweet
          comfort to think that it is not one person of the Trinity that is
          engaged for my salvation; it is not simply one person of the Godhead
          who vows that he will redeem me; but it is a glorious trio of Godlike
          ones, and the three declare, unitedly, |We will save man.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, observe here, that each person is spoken of as performing a
          separate office. |I will pray,| says the Son; that is intercession. |I
          will send,| says the Father; that is donation. |I will comfort,| says
          the Holy Spirit; that is supernatural influence. O! if it were
          possible for us to see the three persons of the Godhead, we should
          behold one of them standing before the throne, with outstretched
          hands, crying day and night, |O, Lord, how long?| We should see one
          girt with Urim and Thummim, precious stones, on which are written the
          twelve names of the tribes of Israel; we should behold him, crying
          unto his Father, |Forget not thy promises, forget not thy covenant;|
          we should hear him make mention of our sorrows, and tell forth our
          griefs on our behalf, for he is our intercessor. And could we behold
          the Father, we should not see him a listless and idle spectator of the
          intercession of the Son, but we should see him with attentive ear
          listening to every word of Jesus, and granting every petition. Where
          is the Holy Spirit all the while? Is he lying idle? O no; he is
          floating over the earth, and when he seas a weary soul, he says, |Come
          to Jesus, he will give you rest;| when he beholds an eye filled with
          tears, he wipes away the tears, and bids the mourner look for comfort
          on the cross; when he sees the tempest-tossed believer, he takes the
          helm of his soul and speaks the word of consolation; he helpeth the
          broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds; and, ever on his mission
          of mercy, he flies around the world, being everywhere present. Behold,
          how the three persons work together. Do not then say, |I am grateful
          to the Son| -- so you ought to be, but God the Son no more saves you
          than God the Father. Do not imagine that God the Father is a great
          tyrant, and that God the Son had to die to make him merciful. It was
          not to make the Father's love towards his people. Oh, no. One loves as
          much as the other; the three are conjoined in the great purpose of
          rescuing the elect from damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you must notice another thing in my text, which will show the
          blessed unity of the three -- the one person promises to the other.
          The Son says, |I will pray the Father.| |Very well,| the disciples may
          have said, |we can trust you for that.| |And he will send you.| You
          see, here is the Son signing a bond on behalf of the Father. |He will
          send you another Comforter.| There is a bond on behalf of the Holy
          Spirit too. |And he will abide with you forever.| One person speaks
          for the other, and how could they, if there were any disagreement
          between them? If one wished to save, and the other not, they could not
          promise on another's behalf. But whatever the Son says, the Father
          listens to; whatever the Father promises, the Holy Ghost works; and,
          whatever the Holy Ghost injects into the soul, that God the Father
          fulfils. So, the three together mutually promise on one another's
          behalf. There is a bond with three names appended -- Father, Son, and
          Holy Ghost. By three immutable things, as well as by two, the
          Christian is secured beyond the reach of death and hell. A Trinity of
          securities, because there is a Trinity of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III, Our third point is, the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in
          believers. Now, beloved, these first two things have been matters of
          pure doctrine; this is the subject of experience. The indwelling of
          the Holy Ghost is a subject so profound, and so having to do with the
          inner man, that no soul will be able truly and really to comprehend
          what I say, unless it has been taught of God. I have heard of an old
          minister, who told a fellow of one of the Cambridge colleges, that he
          understood a language that he never learned in all his life. |I have
          not,| he said, |even a smattering of Greek, and I know no Latin, but
          thank God, I can talk the language of Canaan, and that is more than
          you can.| So, beloved, I shall now have to talk a little of the
          language of Canaan. If you cannot comprehend me, I am much afraid it
          is because you are not of Israelitish extraction; you are not a child
          of God, nor an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told in the text, that Jesus would send the Comforter, who
          would abide in the saints forever; who would dwell with them, and be
          in them. Old Ignatius, the martyr, used to call himself Theophorus, or
          Godbearer, |because,| said he, |I bear about with me the Holy Ghost.|
          And truly every Christian is a Godbearer. |Know ye not that ye are the
          temples of the Holy Ghost? for he dwelleth in you?| That man is no
          Christian who is not the subject of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit;
          he may talk well, he may understand theology, and be a sound
          Calvinist; he will be the child of nature finely dressed, but not the
          living child. He may be a man of so profound an intellect, so gigantic
          a soul, so comprehensive a mind, and so lofty an imagination, that he
          may dive into all the secrets of nature, may know the path which the
          eagle's eye hath not seen, and go into depths where the ken of mortals
          reacheth not, but he shall not be a Christian with all his knowledge,
          he shall not be a son of God with all his researches, unless he
          understands what it is to have the Holy Ghost dwelling in him and
          abiding in him; yea, and that for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people call this fanaticism, and they say, |You are a Quaker; why
          not follow George Fox?| Well, we would not mind that much: we would
          follow any one who followed the Holy Ghost. Even he, with all his
          eccentricities, I doubt not, was, in many cases, actually inspired by
          the Holy Spirit; and whenever I find a man in whom there rests the
          Spirit of God, the spirit within me leaps to hear the spirit within
          him, and we feel that we are one. The Spirit of God in one Christian
          soul recognizes the Spirit in another. I recollect talking with a good
          man, as I believe he was, who was insisting that it was impossible for
          us to know whether we had the Holy Spirit within us or not. I should
          like him to be here this morning, because I would read this verse to
          him, |But ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.|
          Ah! you think you cannot tell whether you have the Holy Spirit or not.
          Can I tell whether I am alive or not? If I were touched by
          electricity, could I tell whether I was or not? I suppose I should;
          the shock would be strong enough to make me know where I stood. So, if
          I have God within me -- if I have Deity tabernacling in my breast --
          if I have God the Holy Ghost resting in my heart, and making a temple
          of my body, do you think I shall know it? Call it fanaticism if you
          will, but I trust that there are some of us who know what it is to be
          always, or generally, under the influence of the Holy Spirit -- always
          in one sense, generally in another. When we have difficulties, we ask
          the direction of the Holy Ghost. When we do not understand a portion
          of Holy Scripture, we ask God the Holy Ghost to shine upon us. When we
          are depressed, the Holy Ghost comforts us. You cannot tell what the
          wondrous power of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost is; how it pulls
          back the hand of the saint when he would touch the forbidden thing;
          how it prompts him to make a covenant with his eyes; how it binds his
          feet, lest they should fall in a slippery way; how it restrains his
          heart, and keeps him from temptation. O ye, who know nothing of the
          indwelling of the Holy Ghost, despise it not. O despise not the Holy
          Ghost, for it is the unpardonable sin. |He that speaketh a word
          against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but he that speaketh
          against the Holy Ghost, it shall never be forgiven him, either in this
          life, or that which is to come.| So saith the Word of God. Therefore
          tremble, lest in anything ye despise the influences of the Holy
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before closing this point, there is one little word that pleases
          me very much, that is |forever.| You knew I should not miss that; you
          were certain I could not let it go without observation. |Abide with
          you forever.| I wish I could get an Armenian here to finish my sermon.
          I fancy I see him taking that word |forever.| He would say, |for --
          forever;| he would have to stammer and stutter; for he could never get
          it out all at once. He might stand and pull it about, and at last he
          would have to say, |The translation is wrong.| And I suppose the poor
          man would have to prove that the original was wrong too. Ah! but
          blessed be God we can read it -- |He shall abide with you forever.|
          Once give me the Holy Ghost, and I shall never lose him till |forever|
          has run out; till eternity has spun its everlasting rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now we have to close up with a brief remark on the reason why the
          world rejects the Holy Ghost. It is said, |Whom the world cannot
          receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him.| You know what
          is sometimes meant by |the world| -- those whom God in his wondrous
          sovereignty passed over when he chose his people: the preterite ones;
          those passed over in God's wondrous preterition -- not the reprobates
          who were condemned to damnation by some awful decree; but those passed
          over by God, when he chose out his elect. These cannot receive the
          Spirit. Again, it means all in a carnal state are not able to procure
          themselves this divine influence; and, thus it is true, |Whom the
          world cannot receive.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The unregenerate world of sinners despises the Holy Ghost, |because it
          seeth him not.| Yes, I believe this is the great secret why many laugh
          at the idea of the existence of the Holy Ghost -- because they see him
          not. You tell the worldling, |I have the Holy Ghost within me.| He
          says, |I cannot see it.| He wants it to be something tangible -- a
          thing he can recognize with his senses. Have you ever heard the
          argument used by a good old Christian against an infidel doctor? The
          doctor said there was no soul, and asked, |Did you ever see a soul?|
          |No,| said the Christian. |Did you ever hear a soul?| |No.| |Did you
          ever smell a soul?| |No.| |Did you ever taste a soul?| |No.| |Did you
          ever feel a soul?| |Yes,| said the man -- |I feel I have one within
          me.| |Well,| said the doctor, |there are four senses against one; you
          only have one on your side.| |Very well,| said the Christian, |Did you
          ever see a pain?| |No.| |Did you ever hear a pain?| |No.| |Did you
          ever smell a pain?| |No.| |Did you ever taste a pain?| |No.| |Did you
          ever feel a pain?| |Yes.| |And that is quite enough, I suppose, to
          prove there is a pain?| |Yes.| So the worldling says there is no Holy
          Ghost, because he cannot see it. Well, but we feel it. You say that is
          fanaticism, and that we never felt it. Suppose you tell me that honey
          is bitter, I reply, |No, I am sure you cannot have tasted it; taste it
          and try.| So with the Holy Ghost; if you did but feel his influence,
          you would no longer say there is no Holy Spirit, because you cannot
          see it. Are there not many things, even in nature, which we cannot
          see? Did you ever see the wind? No; but ye know there is wind, when
          you behold the hurricane tossing the waves about, and rending down the
          habitations of men; or when, in the soft evening zephyr, it kisses the
          flowers, and maketh dew-drops hang in pearly coronets around the rose.
          Did ye ever see electricity? No; but ye know there is such a thing,
          for it travels along the wires for thousands of miles, and carries our
          messages; though you cannot see the thing itself, you know there is
          such a thing. So you must believe there is a Holy Ghost working in us,
          both to will and to do, even though it is beyond our senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the last reason why worldly men laugh at the doctrine of the Holy
          Spirit, is, because they do not know it. If they know it by heartfelt
          experience and if they recognized its agency in the soul; if they had
          ever been touched by it; if they had been made to tremble under a
          sense of sin; if they had had their hearts melted, they would never
          have doubted the existence of the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, it says, |He dwelleth with you, and shall be in
          you.| We will close up with that sweet recollection -- the Holy Ghost
          dwells in all believers and shall be with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One word of comment and advice to the saints of God, and to sinners,
          and I have done. Saints of the Lord! ye have this morning heard that
          God the Holy Ghost is a person; ye have had it proved to your souls.
          What follows from this? Why, it followeth how earnest ye should be in
          prayer to the Holy Spirit, as well as for the Holy Spirit. Let me say
          that this is an inference that you should lift up your prayers to the
          Holy Ghost: that you should cry earnestly unto him; for he is able to
          do exceeding abundantly above all you can speak or think. See this
          mass of people. What is to convert it? See this crowd? Who is to make
          my influence permeate through the mass? You know this place now has a
          mighty influence, and, God blessing us, it will have an influence not
          only upon this city, but upon England at large; for we now employ the
          press as well as the pulpit; and certainly, I should say, before the
          close of the year, more than two hundred thousand of my productions
          will be scattered through the land -- words uttered by my lips, or
          written by my pen. But how can this influence be rendered for good?
          How shall God's glory be promoted by it? Only by incessant prayer for
          the Holy Spirit; by constantly calling down the influence of the Holy
          Ghost upon us; we want him to rest upon every page that is printed,
          and upon every word that is uttered. Let us then be doubly earnest in
          pleading with the Holy Ghost, that he would come and own our labors;
          that the whole church at large may be revived thereby, and not
          ourselves only, but the whole world share in the benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, to the ungodly, I have this one closing word to say. Ever be
          careful how you speak of the Holy Ghost. I do not know what the
          unpardonable sin is, and I do not think any man understands it; but it
          is something like this: |He that speaketh a word against the Holy
          Ghost, it shall never be forgiven him.| I do not know what that means;
          but tread carefully! There is danger; there is a pit which our
          ignorance has covered by sand; tread carefully! you may be in it
          before the next hour. If there is any strife in your heart to-day,
          perhaps you will go to the ale-house and forget it. Perhaps there is
          some voice speaking in your soul, and you will put it away. I do not
          tell you will be resisting the Holy Ghost, and committing the
          unpardonable sin; but it is somewhere there. Be very careful. O, there
          is no crime on earth so black as the crime against the Holy Spirit! Ye
          may blaspheme the Father, and ye shall be damned for it, unless ye
          repent; ye may blaspheme the Son, and hell shall be your portion,
          unless ye are forgiven; but blaspheme the Holy Ghost, and thus saith
          the Lord: |There is no forgiveness, either in this world nor in the
          world which is to come.| I cannot tell you what it is; I do no profess
          to understand it; but there it is. It is the danger signal; stop! man,
          stop! If thou has despised the Holy Spirit -- if thou hast laughed at
          his revelations, and scorned what Christians call his influence, I
          beseech thee, stop! This morning seriously deliberate. Perhaps some of
          you have actually committed the unpardonable sin; stop! Let fear stop
          you; sit down. Do not drive on so rashly as you have done, Jehu! O
          slacken your reins! Thou who are such a profligate in sin -- thou who
          hast uttered such hard words against the Trinity, stop! Ah! it makes
          us all stop. It makes us all draw up, and say, |Have I not perhaps so
          done?| Let us think of this; and let us not at any time stifle either
          with the words or the acts of God the Holy Ghost.<br />
