          Head of the Lord -- His simple Divinity; because He is the Beginning
          and Creator of all things: in Daniel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The white hair of the Lord, because He is |the Ancient of Days:| as
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of the Lord -- the Divine inspection: because He sees all
          things. Like that in the apostle: For all things are naked and open in
          His eyes.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyelids of the Lord -- hidden spiritual mysteries in the Divine
          precepts. In the Psalm: |His eyelids question, that is prove, the
          children of men.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The smelling of the Lord -- His delight in the prayers or works of the
          saints. In Genesis: |And the Lord smelled an odour of sweetness.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The mouth of the Lord -- His Son, or word addressed to men. In the
          prophet, |The mouth of the Lord hath spoken;| and elsewhere, |They
          provoked His mouth to anger.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The tongue of the Lord -- His Holy Spirit. In the Psalm: |My tongue is
          a pen.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The face of the Lord -- His manifestation. In Exodus, |My face shall
          go before thee;| and in the prophet, |The face of the Lord divided
          them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The word of the Lord -- His Son. In the Psalm: |My heart hath uttered
          a good word.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The arm of the Lord -- His Son, by whom He hath wrought all His works.
          In the prophet Isaiah: |And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The right hand of the Lord -- that is, His Son; as also above in the
          Psalm: |The right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The right hand of the Lord -- electio omnis. As in Deuteronomy: |In
          His right hand is a fiery law.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The wings of the Lord -- Divine protection. In the Psalm: |In the
          shadow of Thy wings will I hope.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The shoulder of the Lord -- the Divine power, by which He condescends
          to carry the feeble. In Deuteronomy: |He took them up, and put them on
          His shoulders.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The hand of the Lord -- Divine operation. In the prophet: |Have not my
          hands made all these things?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The finger of the Lord -- the Holy Spirit, by whose operation the
          tables of the law in Exodus are said to have been written; and in the
          Gospel: |If I by the finger of God cast out demons|
        </p>
        <p>
          The fingers of the Lord -- The lawgiver Moses, or the prophets. In the
          Psalm: |I will regard the heavens,| that is, the books of the Law and
          the Prophets, |the works of Thy fingers.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of the Lord -- His Son. In the apostle: |Christ the power
          of God, and the wisdom of God;| and in Solomon: |The wisdom of the
          Lord reacheth from one end to the other mightily.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The womb of the Lord -- the hidden recess of Deity out of which He
          brought forth His Son. In the Psalm: |Out of the womb, before Lucifer,
          have I borne Thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The feet of the Lord -- His immoveableness and eternity. In the Psalm:
          |And thick darkness was under His feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The throne of the Lord -- angels, or saints, or simply sovereign
          dominion. In the Psalm: |Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Seat -- the same as above, angels or saints, because the Lord sits
          upon these. In the Psalm: |The Lord sat upon His holy seat.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The descent of the Lord -- His visitation of men. As in Micah:
          |Behold, the Lord shall come forth from His place; He shall come down
          trampling under foot the ends of the earth.| Likewise in a bad sense.
          In Genesis: |The Lord came down to see the tower.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The ascent of the Lord -- the raising up of man, who is taken from
          earth to heaven. In the Psalm: |Who ascendeth above the heaven of
          heavens to the east.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The standing of the Lord -- the patience of the Deity, by which He
          bears with sinners that they may come to repentance. As in Habakkuk:
          |He stood and measured the earth; and in the Gospel: |Jesus stood, and
          bade him be called,| that is, the blind man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition of the Lord -- His assumption of our flesh, through
          which by His birth, His death, His resurrection, His ascent into
          heaven, He made transitions, so to say. In the Song of Songs: |Behold,
          He cometh, leaping upon the mountains, bounding over the hills.|
        </p>
        <p>The going of the Lord -- His coming or visitation. In the Psalm.</p>
        <p>
          The way of the Lord -- the operation of the Deity. As in Job, in
          speaking of the devil: |He is the beginning of the ways of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: The ways of the Lord -- His precepts. In Hosea: |For the ways
          of the Lord are straight, and the just shall walk in them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The footsteps of the Lord -- the signs of His secret operations. As in
          the Psalm: |And Thy footsteps shall not be known.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge of the Lord -- that which makes men to know Him. To
          Abraham He says: |Now I know that thou fearest the Lord;| that is, I
          have made thee to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ignorance of God is His disapproval. In the Gospel: |I know you
          not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The remembrance of God -- His mercy, by which He rejects and has mercy
          on whom He will. So in Genesis: |The Lord remembered Noah;| and in
          another passage: |The Lord hath remembered His people.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The repentance of the Lord -- His change of procedure. As in the book
          of Kings: |It repented me that I have made Saul king.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The anger and wrath of the Lord -- the vengeance of the Deity upon
          sinners, when He bears with them with a view to punishment, does not
          at once judge them according to strict equity. As in the Psalm: |In
          His anger and in His wrath will He trouble them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The sleeping of the Lord -- when, in the thoughts of some, His
          faithfulness is not sufficiently wakeful. In the Psalm: |Awake, why
          sleepest Thou, O Lord?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The watches of the Lord -- in the guardianship of His elect He is
          always at hand by the presence of His Deity. In the Psalm: |Lo! He
          will not slumber nor sleep.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The sitting of the Lord -- His ruling. In the Psalm: |The Lord sitteth
          upon His holy seat.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The footstool of the Lord -- man assumed by the Word; or His saints,
          as some think. In the Psalm: |Worship ye His footstool, for it is
          holy.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The walking of the Lord -- the delight of the Deity in the walks of
          His elect. In the prophet: |I will walk in them, and will be their
          Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The trumpet of the Lord -- His mighty voice. In the apostle: |At the
          command, and at the voice of the archangel, and at the trumpet of God,
          shall He descend from heaven.|
