          1. Many offshoots of numerous heresies have already been formed from
          those heretics we have described. This arises from the fact that
          numbers of them -- indeed, we may say all -- desire themselves to be
          teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy in which they
          have been involved. Forming one set of doctrines out of a totally
          different system of opinions, and then again others from others, they
          insist upon teaching something new, declaring themselves the inventors
          of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to call into
          existence. To give an example: Springing from Saturninus and Marcion,
          those who are called Encratites (self-controlled) preached against
          marriage, thus setting aside the original creation of God, and
          indirectly blaming Him who made the male and female for the
          propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned among them have
          also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus proving themselves
          ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny, too, the
          salvation of him who was first created. It is but lately, however,
          that this opinion has been invented among them. A certain man named
          Tatian first introduced the blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin's,
          and as long as he continued with him he expressed no such views; but
          after his martyrdom he separated from the Church, and, excited and
          puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he were superior to
          others, he composed his own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a
          system of certain invisible Ã†ons, like the followers of Valentinus;
          while, like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was
          nothing else than corruption and fornication. But his denial of Adam's
          salvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.

          2. Others, again, following upon Basilides and Carpocrates, have
          introduced promiscuous intercourse and a plurality of wives, and are
          indifferent about eating meats sacrificed to idols, maintaining that
          God does not greatly regard such matters. But why continue? For it is
          an impracticable attempt to mention all those who, in one way or
          another, have fallen away from the truth.<br />
