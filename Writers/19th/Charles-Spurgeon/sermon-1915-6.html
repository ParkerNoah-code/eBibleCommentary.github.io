        <p>|Let no man beguile you of your reward.| -- Colossians 2:18.</p>
        <p>
          THERE is an allusion here to the prize which was offered to the
          runners in the Olympic games, and at the outset it is well for us to
          remark how very frequently the Apostle Paul conducts us by his
          metaphors to the racecourse. Over and over again he is telling us so
          to run that we may obtain, bidding us to strive, and at other times to
          agonize, and speaking of wrestling and contending. Ought not this to
          make us feel what an intense thing the Christian life is -- not a
          thing of sleepiness or haphazard, not a thing to be left now and then
          to a little superficial consideration? It must be a matter which
          demands all our strength, so that when we are saved there is a living
          principle put within us which demands all our energies, and gives us
          energy over and above any that we ever had before. Those who dream
          that carelessness will find its way to heaven have made a great
          mistake. The way to hell is neglect, but the way to heaven is very
          different. |How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?| A
          little matter of neglect brings you to ruin, but our Master's words
          are |Strive to enter in at the straight gate, for many, I say unto
          you, shall seek| -- merely seek -- |to enter in, and shall not be
          able.| Striving is needed more than seeking. Let us pray that God the
          Holy Spirit would always enable us to be in downright, awful earnest
          about the salvation of our souls. May we never count this a matter of
          secondary importance, but may we seek first, and beyond everything
          else, the kingdom of God and his righteousness. May we lay hold on
          eternal life; may we so run that we may obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would press this upon your memories because I do observe, observe it
          in myself as well as in my fellow-Christians, that we are often more
          earnest about the things of this life than we are about the things of
          the life to come. We are all impressed with the fact that in these
          days of competition, if a man would not be run over and crushed
          beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of poverty, he must exert
          himself. No man seems now able to keep his head above water with the
          faint swimmer strokes which our forefathers used to give. We have to
          strive, and the bread that perisheth hath to be laboured for. Shall it
          be that this poor world shall engross our earliest thoughts and our
          latest cares, and shall the world to come have only now and then a
          consideration' No; may we love our God with all our heart, and all our
          soul, and all our strength, and may we lay our body, soul, and spirit
          upon the altar of Christ's service, for these are but our reasonable
          sacrifice to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Apostle in the text before us gives us a warning, which comes
          to the same thing, however it is interpreted; but the passage is
          somewhat difficult of rendering, and there have been several meanings
          given to it. Out of these there are three meanings which have been
          given of the text before us which are worthy of notice. |Let no man
          beguile you of your reward.| The Apostle, in the first place, may mean
          here: --
        </p>
        <p>I. LET NO MAN BEGUILE ANY OF YOU</p>
        <p>
          Now, my brethren, we have, many of us, commenced the Christian race,
          or we profess to have done so, but the number of the starters is far
          greater than the number of the winners. |They that run in a race run
          all, but one receiveth the prize.| |Many are called, but few are
          chosen.| Many commence, apparently, in the Christian career, but after
          a while, though they did run well, something hinders them that they do
          not obey the truth, and they go out from us because they were not of
          us, for if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued
          with us. Now we may expect, now that we have commenced to run, that
          some will come and try to turn us out of the race course openly -- not
          plausibly and with sophistry, but with an open and honest wickedness.
          Some will tell us plainly that there is no reward to run for, that our
          religion is all a mistake, that the pleasures of this world are the
          only things worth seeking, that there are delights of the flesh and
          the lusts thereof, and that we should do well to enjoy them. We shall
          meet the Atheist with his sneer and with his ringing laugh. We shall
          meet with all kinds of persons who will to our faces tell us to turn
          back, for there is no heaven, there is no Christ, or, if there be, it
          is not worth our while to take so much trouble to find him. Take heed
          of these people. Meet them face to face with dauntless courage. Mind
          not their sneers. If they persecute you only, reckon this to be an
          honour to you, for what is persecution but the tribute which
          wickedness pays to righteousness, and what is it, indeed, but the
          recognition of the seed of the woman when the seed of the serpent
          would fain bite his heel?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Apostle does not warn you so much against those people who
          openly come to you in this way. He knows that you will be on the alert
          against them. He gives a special warning against some others who would
          beguile you; that is to say, who will try to turn you out of the right
          road, but who will not tell you that they mean to do so. They pretend
          that they are going to show you something that you knew not before,
          some improvement upon what you have hitherto learned. In Paul's day
          there were some who took off the attention of the Christian from the
          worship of God to the worship of angels. |Angels,| said they, |these
          are holy beings; they keep watch over you; you should speak of them
          with great respect|; and then when they grew bolder, they said, |You
          should ask their protection|; and then after a little while they said,
          |You should worship them; you should make them intermediate
          intercessors|; and so, step by step, they went on and established an
          old heresy which lasted for many years in the Christian church, and
          which is not dead even now, and thus the worship of angels crept in.
        </p>
        <p>
          And nowadays you will meet with men who will say, |That bread upon the
          Table -- why, it represents the body of Jesus Christ to you when you
          come to the Lord's Supper; therefore, you ought to treat that bread
          with great respect.| By and bye they will get a little bolder, and
          then they say, |As it represents Christ, you may worship it, pay it
          respect as if it were Christ.| By and bye it will come to this, that
          you must have a napkin under your chin, lest you should drop a crumb;
          or it will be very wicked if a drop of the sacred wine should cling to
          your moustache when you drink; and there will be the directions which
          are given in some of the papers coming out from the High Church party
          -- absurdities which are only worthy of the nursery -- about the way
          in which the holy bread is to be eaten, and the holy wine is to be
          drunk -- bringing in idolatry, sheer, clear idolatry, under the
          presence of improving upon the too bare simplicity of the worship of
          Christ. Have a care of the very first step, I pray you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, perhaps, it may come to you in another shape. One will say to you,
          |The place in which you worship -- is it not very dear to you? That
          seat where you have been accustomed to sit and listen, is it not
          dear?|; and your natural instincts will say, |Yes. | Then it will go a
          little farther. |That place is holy; it ought never to be used for
          anything but worship | Then a little farther it will be, |Oh! that is
          the house of God,| and you will come to believe that, contrary to the
          words which you know are given to you of the Holy Ghost, that God
          dwells not in temples made with hands; that is to say, in these
          buildings, and you will get by degrees to have a worship of places,
          and a worship of days, and a worship of bread, and a worship of wine.
          And then it will be said to you, |Your minister, has he not often
          cheered you? Well then, you should reverence him; call him
          'Reverend.'| Go a little farther, and you will call him |Father|; yet
          a little farther, and he will be your confessor; get a little farther
          and he will be your infallible Pope. It is all step by step until it
          is done. The first step seems to be very harmless indeed. Indeed, it
          is a kind of voluntary humility. You look as if you were humbling
          yourselves, and were paying reverence to these things for God's sake,
          whereas the object is to get you to pay reverence to them, instead of
          to God, and here the Apostle's words come in, |Let no man setting up
          other objects of reverence besides those which spiritual men worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, they too, by slow degrees try to insinuate a different way of
          living from that which is the true life of the Christian. You who have
          believed in Jesus are saved; your sins are forgiven you for his name's
          sake. You are accustomed to go to Jesus Christ constantly to receive
          that washing of the feet of which he spake to Peter when he said, |He
          that is washed needeth not except to wash his feet, for he is clean
          every whit.| You go to him with |Forgive us our trespasses as we
          forgive them that trespass against us.| But there will be some who
          will come in and tell you that to live in that way by a simple faith
          in Jesus Christ is not, perhaps, the best way. Could you not get a
          little farther? Could you not lead the life of those recluses who
          mortify the flesh in such a way that at last they come to have no
          sins, but commence to be perfect in themselves? Could you not begin,
          at least in some degree, to commit your soul's care to some priest, or
          to some friend, and instead of making every place holy and every day a
          holy day, would it not be well to fast on such and such days in the
          week, to scrupulously observe this rule and the other rule, and walk
          by the general opinion of the ancient Church, or by some one of those
          books which profess to show how they used to do it a thousand years
          ago? All this may have a great show of wisdom, and antiquity, and
          beauty; there may be a semblance of everything that is holy about it,
          and names that should never be mentioned without reverence may be
          appended to it all, but listen to the Apostle as he saith, |Beware
          lest any man beguile you of your reward,| for if they get you away
          from living upon Christ as a poor sinner from day to day by simple
          confidence in him, they will beguile you of your reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another party who will seek to beguile you of your reward by
          bringing in speculative notions, instead of the simple truths of God's
          Word. There is a certain class of persons who think that a sermon must
          be a good one when they cannot understand it, and who are always
          impressed with a man whose words are long; and if his sentences are
          involved they feel, poor souls, that because they do not know what he
          is talking about, there is no doubt that he is a very wise and learned
          man; and after a while when he does propound something that they can
          catch at, though it may be quite contrary to what they have learned at
          their mother's knee or from their father's Bible, yet they are ready
          to be led off by it. There are many men nowadays who seem to spend
          their time in nothing else but in spinning new theories, and inventing
          new systems, gutting the gospel taking the very soul and bowels out of
          it, and leaving there nothing but the mere skin and outward bones. The
          life and marrow of the gospel is being taken away by their learning,
          by their philosophies, by their refinements, by their bringing
          everything down to the test of this wonderfully enlightened nineteenth
          century to which we are all, I suppose, bound to defer. But a voice
          comes to us, |let no man beguile you of your reward.| Stand fast to
          the old truths; they will outlast all these philosophies. Stand fast
          to the old way of living; it will outlast all the inventions of men.
          Stand fast by Christ, for you want no other object of worship but
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle gives us this warning, |Let no man beguile you of your
          reward,| reminding us that these persons are very likely to beguile
          us. They will beguile us by their character. Have I not often heard
          young people say of such and such a preacher who preaches error, |But
          he is so good a man.| That is nothing to the point. |Though we or an
          angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
          have preached unto you, let him be accursed.| If the life of the man
          should be blameless as the life of Christ, yet if he preach to you
          other than the gospel of Jesus Christ, take no heed of him; he weareth
          but the sheep's clothing, and is a wolf after all. Some will plead,
          |But such and such a man is so eloquent|. Ah! brethren, may the day
          never come when your faith shall stand in the words of men. What is a
          ready orator, after all, that he should convince your hearts? Are
          there not ready orators caught any day for everything? Men speak,
          speak fluently, and speak well in the cause of evil, and there are
          some that can speak much more fluently and more eloquently for evil
          than any of our poor tongues are ever likely to do for the right. But
          words, words, words, flowers of rhetoric, oratory -- are these the
          things that saved you? Are ye so foolish that having begun in the
          spirit by being convinced of your sins, having begun by being led
          simply to Christ, and putting your trust in him -- are you now to be
          led astray by these poetic utterances and flowery periods of men? God
          forbid! Let nothing of this kind beguile you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there will be added to these remarks that the man is not only
          very good and very eloquent, but that he is very earnest -- he seems
          very humble-minded. Yes, and of old they wore rough garments to
          deceive, and in the connection of the text we find that those persons
          were noted for their voluntary humility and their worship of angels.
          Satan knows very well that if he comes in black he will be discovered,
          but if he puts on the garb of an angel of light, then men will think
          he comes from God, and so will be deceived. |By their fruits ye shall
          know them.| If they give you not the gospel, if they exalt not Christ,
          if they bear not witness to salvation through the precious blood, if
          they do not lift up Jesus Christ as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
          wilderness, have nothing to do with them, speak as they may. |Let no
          man beguile you of your reward.| Though it should happen to be your
          relative, one whom you love, one who may have many claims on your
          respect otherwise -- let no man, let no man, however plausible may be
          his speech, or eminent his character, beguile you of your reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recollect, you professors, you lose the reward if you lose the road to
          the reward. He that runs may run very fast, but if he does not run in
          the course, he wins not the prize. You may believe false doctrine with
          great earnestness, but you will find it false for all that. You may
          give yourself up indefatigably to the pursuit of the wrong religion,
          but it will ruin your souls. A notion is abroad that if you are but
          earnest and sincere, you will be all right. Permit me to remind you
          that if you travel never so earnestly to the north, you will never
          reach the south, and if you earnestly take prussic acid you will die,
          and if you earnestly cut off a limb you will be wounded. You must not
          only be earnest, but you must be right in it. Hence is it necessary to
          say, |Let no man beguile you of your reward.| |I bear them witness,|
          said the Apostle, |that they had a zeal for God, but not according to
          knowledge, but went about to establish their own righteousness, and
          have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.| Oh! may we
          not be beguiled, then, so as to miss the reward of heaven at the last!
        </p>
        <p>
          But I must pass on, especially as the light fails us this evening; I
          hope it is prognostic of a coming shower. Here is a second rendering
          which may be given to the text: --
        </p>
        <p>II. LET NO MAN DOMINEER OVER YOU.</p>
        <p>
          This rendering, or something analogous to it, is in the French
          translation. One of the great expositors in his commentary upon this
          passage refers it to the judges at the end of the course, who sometime
          would give the reward to the wrong person, and the person who had
          really run well might thus be deprived of his reward. Now, however
          close a man may be to Christ, the world, instead of honouring him for
          it, will, on the contrary, censure and condemn him, and hence the
          Apostle's exhortation is, |Let no man domineer over you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, my brethren, I would earnestly ask you to remember this first as
          to your course of action. If you conscientiously believe that you are
          right in what you are doing, study very little who is pleased or who
          is displeased. If you are persuaded in your own soul that what you
          believe and what you do are acceptable to God, whether they are
          acceptable to man or not is of very small consequence. You are not
          man's servant, you do not look to man for your reward, and, therefore,
          you need not care what man's opinion may be in this matter. Be just
          and fear not. Tread in the footsteps of Christ, follow what may. Live
          not on the breath of men. Let not their applause make you feel great,
          for perhaps then their censure will make you faint. Let no man in this
          respect domineer over you, but let Christ be your Master, and look to
          his smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          So not only with regard to your course of action, but also with
          reference to your confidence, let no man domineer over you. If you put
          your trust in Jesus Christ, there are some who will say it is
          presumption. Let them say it is presumption. |Wisdom is justified of
          all her children,| and so shall faith be. If you take the promise of
          God and rest upon it, there will be some who will say that you are
          hare-brained fanatics. Let them say it. They that trust in him shall
          never be confounded. The result will honour your faith. You have but
          to wait a little while, and, perhaps, they that now censure you will
          have to hold up their hands in astonishment, and say with you, |What
          hath God wrought?| Your confidence in Christ, especially, my dear
          young friend, I trust does not depend upon the smile of your
          relatives. If it did, then their frown might crush it. Walk with your
          Saviour in the lowly walk of holy confidence, and let not your faith
          rest in man, but in the smile of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let no man domineer over you, again, by judging your motives. Men will
          always give as bad a reason as they can for a good man's actions. It
          seems to be innate in human nature never to give a man credit for
          being right if you can help it, and often tender minds have been
          greatly wounded when they have been misrepresented, and their actions
          have been imputed to sinister and selfish motives, when they have
          really desired to serve Christ. But do not let your heart be broken
          about that. You will appear before the judgment-seat of Christ: do not
          care about these petty judgments-seats of men. Go on with your
          Master's work dauntlessly and fearlessly. Let them say, as David's
          brethren said of him, |Because of thy pride and the naughtiness of thy
          heart to see the battle, art thou come.| Go you and get Goliath's
          head, and bring it back, and that shall be the best answer to these
          sneering ones. When they see that God is with you, and that he has
          given you the triumph, you shall have honour, even in the eyes of
          those who now ridicule you. I think sometimes the Christian should
          have very much the same bravado against the judgment of men as David
          had when Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out and said, |How
          glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in
          the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,| and he said, |It was
          before the Lord, and I will yet be more vile than thus.| Let your eye
          be to God, and forget the eyes of men. Live so that, whether they know
          what you do, or do not know, you will not care, for your conduct will
          bear the blaze of the great Judgment Day, and, therefore, the
          criticisms of earth do not affect you. Let no man domineer over you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So may I put it in another light -- let no man sway your conscience so
          as to lead you. I am always anxious, my dear hearers, that, whatever
          respect I may ever win from you -- and I trust I may have your esteem
          and your affection -- yet that you will never believe a doctrine
          simply because I utter it, but unless I can confirm it from the Word
          of God, away with it. If it be not according to the teaching of the
          Lord and Master, I beseech you follow me not. Follow me only as far as
          I follow Christ. And so with every other man. Let it be God's truth,
          God's Word, the Holy Spirit's witness to that Word in your soul, that
          you are seeking after, but rest, I pray you, never short of that, for
          if you do your faith must stand merely in the wisdom of men, and when
          the man who helped you to believe is gone, perhaps your faith may be
          gone too, when most you need its comforting power. No; let no man
          domineer over you, but press forward in the Christian race, looking
          unto Jesus, and looking unto Jesus only.
        </p>

          But now a third meaning belongs to the text. A happy circumstance it
          is, this dark night, that the preacher does not need to use his
          manuscript, for if he did his sermon must certainly come to an end
          now. But here is this point, |Let no man beguile you of your reward.|
          It may mean this: --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. LET NO MAN ROB YOU OF THE PRESENT REWARD WHICH YOU HAVE IN BEING
          A CHRISTIAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let no man deprive you of the present comfort which your faith should
          bring to you. Let me just for a few minutes have your attention while
          I speak upon this. Dear brethren, you and I, if we are believers in
          Christ, are this day completely pardoned. There is no sin in God's
          book against us. We are wholly and completely justified. The
          righteousness of Jesus Christ covers us from head to foot, and we
          stand before God as if we had never sinned. Now let no man rob you of
          this reward. Do not be tempted by anything that is said to doubt the
          completeness of a believer in Christ. Hold this, and, as you hold it,
          enjoy it. Do not let the man, yourself, whom you have most to fear,
          beguile you. Even though conscience should upbraid you, and you should
          have many grave reasons for doubt, as you imagine, yet if you believe
          in Jesus, stand to it -- |There is, therefore, now no condemnation to
          me, for I am in Christ Jesus; he that believeth on him is not
          condemned; I have believed, and I am not condemned, neither will he
          permit condemnation to be thundered against me, for Christ has borne
          my sin for me, and I am clear in him.| Let no man beguile you of the
          reward of feeling that you are complete in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, you who have believed in Jesus Christ are safe in Christ.
          Because he lives, you shall live also. Who shall separate us from the
          love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord? He has said, |I give
          unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
          any pluck them out of my hand.| Now there are some who will tell you
          that you are not safe, and that it is dangerous for you to believe
          that you are. Let no man beguile you of this reward. You are saved. If
          you are believing on him, he will keep you, and you may sing, |Now
          unto him that is able to keep us from falling, and to present us
          faultless before his presence with exceeding great joy. unto him be
          glory.| Hold to that blessed truth that you are in Jesus -- safe in
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a third blessed truth. that not only are you pardoned and
          safe in Christ, but you are accepted at this moment, in the Beloved.
          Your acceptance with God does not rest upon anything in you. You are
          accepted because you are in Christ, accepted for Christ's sake. Now
          sometimes you will get robbed of this reward if you listen to the
          voice which says, |Why, there is sin in you still; your prayers are
          imperfect; your actions are stained.| Yes, but let no man beguile you
          of this conviction that, sinner as you are, you are still accepted in
          Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord grant that you may feel this within, and let no man beguile
          you of your reward as long as you live. May you live and die in the
          enjoyment of it, beloved, for Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
