        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1735)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, August 19th, 1883, by</p>

          |For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
          law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin, because we are not
          under the law, but under grace? God forbid.| -- Romans 6:14, 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last Sabbath morning I tried to show that the substance and essence of
          the true gospel is the doctrine of God's grace -- that, in fact, if
          you take away the grace of God from the gospel you have extracted from
          it its very life-blood, and there is nothing left worth preaching,
          worth believing, or worth contending for. Grace is the soul of the
          gospel: without it the gospel is dead. Grace is the music of the
          gospel: without it the gospel is silent as to all comfort. I
          endeavoured also to set forth the doctrine of grace in brief terms,
          teaching that God deals with sinful men upon the footing of pure
          mercy: finding them guilty and condemned, he gives free pardons,
          altogether irrespective of past character, or of any good works which
          may be foreseen. Moved only by pity he devises a plan for their rescue
          from sin and its consequences -- a plan in which grace is the leading
          feature. Out of free favour he has provided, in the death of his dear
          Son, an atonement by means of which his mercy can be justly bestowed.
          He accepts all those who place their trust in this atonement,
          selecting faith as the way of salvation, that it may be all of grace.
          In this he acts, from a motive found within himself, and not because
          of any reason found in the sinner's conduct, past, present, or future.
          I tried to show that this grace of God flows towards the sinner from
          of old, and begins its operations upon him when there is nothing good
          in him: it works in him that which is good and acceptable, and
          continues so to work in him till the deed of grace is complete, and
          the believer is received up into the glory for which he is made meet.
          Grace commences to save, and it perseveres till all is done. From
          first to last, from the |A| to the |Z| of the heavenly alphabet,
          everything in salvation is of grace, and grace alone; all is of free
          favour, nothing of merit. |By grace are ye saved through faith; and
          that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,| |So then it is not of
          him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
          mercy.|
        </p>
        <p>
          No sooner is this doctrine set forth in a clear light than men begin
          to cavil at it. It is the target for all carnal logic to shoot at.
          Unrenewed minds never did like it, and they never will; it is so
          humbling to human pride, making so light of the nobility of human
          nature. That men are to be saved by divine charity, that they must as
          condemned criminals receive pardon by the exercise of the royal
          prerogative, or else perish in their sins, is a teaching which they
          cannot endure. God alone is exalted in the sovereignty of his mercy;
          and the sinner can do no better than meekly touch the silver scepter,
          and accept undeserved favour just because God wills to give it: --
          this is not pleasant to the great minds of our philosophers, and the
          broad phylacteries of our moralists, and therefore they turn aside,
          and fight against the empire of grace. Straightway the unrenewed man
          seeks out artillery with which to fight against the gospel of the
          grace of God, and one of the biggest guns he has ever brought to the
          front is the declaration that the doctrine of the grace of God must
          lead to licentiousness. If great sinners are freely saved, then men
          will more readily become great sinners; and if when God's grace
          regenerates a man it abides with him, then men will infer that they
          may live as they like, and yet be saved. This is the
          constantly-repeated objection which I have heard till it wearies me
          with its vain and false noise. I am almost ashamed to have to refute
          so rotten an argument. They dare to assert that men will take license
          to be guilty because God is gracious, and they do not hesitate to say
          that if men are not to be saved by their works they will come to the
          conclusion that their conduct is a matter of indifference, and that
          they may as well sin that grace may abound.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I want to talk a little about this notion; for in part it
          is a great mistake, and in part it is a great lie. In part it is a
          mistake because it arises from misconception, and in part it is a lie
          because men know better, or might know better if they pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          I begin by admitting that the charge does appear somewhat probable. It
          does seem very likely that if we are to go up and down the country,
          and say, |The very chief of sinners may be forgiven through believing
          in Jesus Christ, for God is displaying mercy to the very vilest of the
          vile,| then sin will seem to be a cheap thing. If we are everywhere to
          cry, |Come, ye sinners, come and welcome, and receive free and
          immediate pardon through the sovereign grace of God,| it does seem
          probable that some may basely reply, |Let us sin without stint, for we
          can easily obtain forgiveness.| But that which looks to be probable is
          not, therefore, certain: on the contrary, the improbable and the
          unexpected full often come to pass. In questions of moral influence
          nothing is more deceptive than theory. The ways of the human mind are
          not to be laid down with a pencil and compasses; man is a singular
          being. Even that which is logical is not always inevitable, for men's
          minds are not governed by the rules of the schools. I believe that the
          inference which would lead men to sin because grace reigns is not
          logical, but the very reverse; and I venture to assert that, as a
          matter of fact, ungodly men do not, as a rule plead the grace of God
          as an excuse for their sin. As a rule they are too indifferent to care
          about reasons at all; and if they do offer an excuse it is usually
          more flimsy and superficial. There may be a few men of perverse minds
          who have used this argument, but there is no accounting for the freaks
          of the fallen understanding. I shrewdly suspect that in any cases in
          which such reasoning has been put forward it was a mere pretence, and
          by no means a plea which satisfied the sinner's own conscience. If men
          do thus excuse themselves, it is generally in some veiled manner, for
          the most of them would be utterly ashamed to state the argument in
          plain terms. I question whether the devil himself would be found
          reasoning thus -- |God is merciful, therefore let us be more sinful.|
          It is so diabolical an inference, that I do not like to charge my
          fellow-men with it, though our moralist opposers do not hesitate thus
          to degrade them. Surely, no intelligent being can really persuade
          itself that the goodness of God is a reason for offending him more
          than ever. Moral insanity produces strange reasonings, but it is my
          solemn conviction that very rarely do men practically consider the
          grace of God to be a motive for sin. That which seems so probable at
          the first blush, is not so when we come to consider it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have admitted that a few human beings have turned the grace of God
          into lasciviousness; but I trust no one will ever argue against any
          doctrine on account of the perverse use made of it by the baser sort.
          Cannot every truth be perverted? Is there a single doctrine of
          Scripture which graceless hands have not twisted into mischief? Is
          there not an almost infinite ingenuity in wicked men for making evil
          out of good? If we are to condemn a truth because of the misbehaviour
          of individuals who profess to believe it, we should be found
          condemning our Lord himself for what Judas did, and our holy faith
          would die at the hands of apostates and hypocrites. Let us act like
          rational men. We do not find fault with ropes because poor insane
          creatures have hanged themselves therewith; nor do we ask that the
          wares of Sheffield may be destroyed because edged tools are the
          murderer's instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may appear probable that the doctrine of free grace will be made
          into a license for sin, but a better acquaintance with the curious
          working of the human mind corrects the notion. Fallen as human nature
          is, it is still human, and therefore does not take kindly to certain
          forms of evil -- such, for instance, as inhuman ingratitude. It is
          hardly human to multiply injuries upon those who return us continued
          benefits. The case reminds me of the story of half-a-dozen boys who
          had severe fathers, accustomed to flog them within an inch of their
          lives. Another boy was with them who was tenderly beloved by his
          parents, and known to do so. These young gentlemen met together to
          hold a council of war about robbing an orchard. They were all of them
          anxious to get about it except the favoured youth, who did not enjoy
          the proposal. One of them cried out, |You need not be afraid: if our
          fathers catch us at this work, we shall be half-killed, but your
          father won't lay a hand upon you.| The little boy answered, |And do
          you think because my father is kind to me, that therefore I will do
          wrong and grieve him? I will do nothing of the sort to my dear father.
          He is so good to me that I cannot vex him.| It would appear that the
          argument of the many boys was not overpoweringly convincing to their
          companion: the opposite conclusion was quite as logical, and evidently
          carried weight with it. If God is good to the undeserving, some men
          will go into sin, but there are others of a nobler order whom the
          goodness of God leadeth to repentance. They scorn the beast-like
          argument -- that the more loving God is, the more rebellious we may
          be; and they feel that against a God of goodness it is an evil thing
          to rebel.
        </p>
        <p>
          By-the-way I cannot help observing that I have known persons object to
          the evil influence of the doctrines of grace who were by no means
          qualified by their own morality to be judges of the subject. Morals
          must be in a poor way when immoral persons become their guardians. The
          doctrine of justification by faith is frequently objected to as
          injurious to morals. A newspaper some time ago quoted a verse from one
          of our popular hymns --
        </p>
        <p>|Weary, working, plodding one,</p>
        <p>Why toil you so?</p>
        <p>Cease your doing; all was done</p>
        <p>Long, long ago.</p>
        <p>|Till to Jesus' work you cling</p>
        <p>By a simple faith,</p>
        <p>'Doing' is a deadly thing,</p>
        <p>'Doing' ends in death.|</p>
        <p>
          This is styled mischievous teaching. When I read the article I felt a
          deep interest in this corrector of Luther and Paul, and I wondered how
          much he had drunk in order to elevate his mind to such a pitch of
          theological knowledge. I have found men pleading against the doctrines
          of grace on the ground that they did not promote morality, to whom I
          could have justly replied, |What has morality to do with you, or you
          with it?| These sticklers for good works are not often the doers of
          them. Let legalists look to their own hands and tongues, and leave the
          gospel of grace and its advocates to answer for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back in history, I see upon its pages a refutation of the
          oft-repeated calumny. Who dares to suggest that the men who believed
          in the grace of God have been sinners above other sinners? With all
          their faults, those who throw stones at them will be few if they first
          prove themselves to be their superiors in character. When have they
          been the patrons of vice, or the defenders of injustice? Pitch upon
          the point in English history when this doctrine was very strong in the
          land; who were the men that held these doctrines most firmly? Men like
          Owen, Charnock, Manton, Howe, and I hesitate not to add Oliver
          Cromwell. What kind of men were these? Did they pander to the
          licentiousness of a court? Did they invent a Book of Sports for
          Sabbath diversion? Did they haunt ale-houses and places of revelry?
          Every historian will tell you, the greatest fault of these men in the
          eyes of their enemies was that they were too precise for the
          generation in which they lived, so that they called them Puritans, and
          condemned them as holding a gloomy theology. Sirs, if there was
          iniquity in the land in that day, it was to be found with the
          theological party which preached up salvation by works. The gentlemen
          with their womanish locks and essenced hair, whose speech savoured of
          profanity, were the advocates of salvation by works, and all bedabbled
          with lust they pleaded for human merit; but the men who believed in
          grace alone were of another style. They were not in the chambers of
          rioting and wantonness; where were they? They might be found on their
          knees crying to God for help in temptation; and in persecuting times
          they might be found in prison, cheerfully suffering the loss of all
          things for the truth's sake. The Puritans were the godliest men on the
          face of the earth. Are men so inconsistent as to nickname them for
          their purity, and yet say that their doctrines lead to sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this a solitary instance -- this instance of Puritanism; all
          history confirms the rule: and when it is said that these doctrines
          will create sin, I appeal to facts, and leave the oracle to answer as
          it may. If we are ever to see a pure and godly England we must have a
          gospelized England: if we are to put down drunkenness and the social
          evil it must be by the proclamation of the grace of God. Men must be
          forgiven by grace, renewed by grace, transformed by grace, sanctified
          by grace, preserved by grace; and when that comes to pass the golden
          age will dawn; but while they are merely taught their duty, and left
          to do it of themselves in their own strength, it is labour in vain.
          You may flog a dead horse a long while before it will stir: you need
          to put life into it, for else all your flogging will fail. To teach
          men to walk who have no feet is poor work, and such is instruction in
          morals before grace gives a heart to love holiness. The gospel alone
          supplies men with motive and strength, and therefore it is to the
          gospel that we must look as the real reformer of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall fight this morning with the objection before us as I shall
          find strength. The doctrine of grace, the whole plan of salvation by
          grace, is most promotive of holiness. Wherever it comes it helps us to
          say, |God forbid,| to the question, |Shall we sin, because we are not
          under the law, but under grace?| This I would set out in the clear
          sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>I wish to call your attention to some six or seven points.</p>
        <p>
          I. First, you will see that the gospel of the grace of God promotes
          real holiness in men by remembering that THE SALVATION WHICH IT BRINGS
          IS SALVATION FROM THE POWER OF SIN. When we preach salvation to the
          vilest of men, some suppose we mean by that a mere deliverance from
          hell and an entrance into heaven. It includes all that, and results in
          that, but that is not what we mean. What we mean by salvation is this
          -- deliverance from the love of sin, rescue from the habit of sin,
          setting free from the desire to sin. Now listen. If it be so, that
          that boon of deliverance from sin is the gift of divine grace, in what
          way will that gift, or the free distribution of it, produce sin? I
          fail to see any such danger. On the contrary, I say to the man who
          proclaims a gracious promise of victory over sin, |Make all speed: go
          up and down throughout the world, and tell the vilest of mankind that
          God is willing by his grace to set them free from the love of sin and
          to make new creatures of them.| Suppose the salvation we preach be
          this: -- you that have lived ungodly and wicked lives may enjoy your
          sins, and yet escape the penalty -- that would be mischievous indeed;
          but if it be this, -- you that live the most ungodly and wicked lives
          may yet by believing in the Lord Jesus be enabled to change those
          lives, so that you shall live unto God instead of serving sin and
          Satan, -- what harm can come to the most prudish morals? Why, I say
          spread such a gospel, and let it circulate through every part of our
          vast empire, and let all men hear it, whether they rule in the House
          of Lords or suffer in the house of bondage. Tell them everywhere that
          God freely and of infinite grace is willing to renew men, and make
          them new creatures in Christ Jesus. Can any evil consequences come of
          the freest proclamation of this news? The worse men are, the more
          gladly would we see them embracing this truth, for these are they who
          most need it. I say to every one of you, whoever you may be, whatever
          your past condition, God can renew you according to the power of his
          grace; so that you who are to him like dead, dry bones, can be made to
          live by his Spirit. That renewal will be seen in holy thoughts, and
          pure words, and righteous acts to the glory of God. In great love he
          is prepared to work all these things in all who believe. Why should
          any men be angry at such a statement? What possible harm can come of
          it? I defy the most cunning adversary to object, upon the ground of
          morals, to God's giving men new hearts and right spirits even as he
          pleases.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, let it not be forgotten as a matter of fact that THE
          PRINCIPLE OF LOVE HAS BEEN FOUND TO POSSESS VERY GREAT POWER OVER MEN.
          In the infancy of history nations dream that crime can be put down by
          severity, and they rely upon fierce punishments; but experience
          corrects the error. Our forefathers dreaded forgery, which is a
          troublesome fraud, and interferes with the confidence which should
          exist between man and man. To put it down they made forgery a capital
          offence. Alas for the murders committed by that law! Yet the constant
          use of the gallows was never sufficient to stamp out the crime. Many
          offences have been created and multiplied by the penalty which was
          meant to suppress them. Some offences have almost ceased when the
          penalty against them has been lightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a notable fact as to men, that if they are forbidden to do a
          thing they straightway pine to do it, though they had never thought of
          doing it before. Law commands obedience, but does not promote it; it
          often creates disobedience, and an over-weighted penalty has been
          known to provoke an offence. Law fails, but love wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love in any case makes sin infamous. If one should rob another it
          would be sufficiently bad; but suppose a man robbed his friend, who
          had helped him often when he was in need, everyone would say that his
          crime was most disgraceful. Love brands sin on the forehead with a
          red-hot iron. If a man should kill an enemy, the offence would be
          grievous; but if he slew his father, to whom he owes his life, or his
          mother, on whose breasts he was nursed in infancy, then all would cry
          out against the monster. In the light of love sin is seen to be
          exceeding sinful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all. Love has a great constraining power towards the
          highest form of virtue. Deeds to which a man could not be compelled on
          the ground of law, men have cheerfully done because of love. Would our
          brave seamen man the life-boat to obey an Act of Parliament? No, they
          would indignantly revolt against being forced to risk their lives; but
          they will do it freely to save their fellow-men. Remember that text of
          the apostle, |Scarcely for a righteous (or merely just) man will one
          die: yet peradventure,| says he, |for a good (benevolent) man some
          would even dare to die.| Goodness wins the heart, and one is ready to
          die for the kind and generous. Look how men have thrown away their
          lives for great leaders. That was an immortal saying of the wounded
          French soldier. When searching for the bullet the surgeon cut deeply,
          and the patient cried out, |A little lower and you will touch the
          Emperor,| meaning that the Emperor's name was written on his heart. In
          several notable instances men have thrown themselves into the jaws of
          death to save a leader whom they loved. Duty holds the fort, but love
          casts its body in the way of the deadly bullet. Who would think of
          sacrificing his life on the ground of law? Love alone counts not life
          so dear as the service of the beloved. Love to Jesus creates a heroism
          of which law knows nothing. All the history of the church of Christ,
          when it has been true to its Lord, is a proof of this.

        <p>
          Kindness also, working by the law of love, has often changed the most
          unworthy, and therein proved that it is not a factor of evil. We have
          often heard the story of the soldier who had been degraded to the
          ranks, and flogged and imprisoned, and yet for all that he would get
          drunk and misbehave himself. The commanding officer said one day, |I
          have tried almost everything with this man, and can do nothing with
          him. I will try one thing more.| When he was brought in, the officer
          addressed him, and said, |You seem incorrigible: we have tried
          everything with you; there seems to be no hope of a change in your
          wicked conduct. I am determined to try if another plan will have any
          effect. Though you deserve flogging and long imprisonment, I shall
          freely forgive you.| The man was greatly moved by the unexpected and
          undeserved pardon, and became a good soldier. The story wears truth on
          its brow: we all see that it would probably end so.
        </p>
        <p>
          That anecdote is such good argument that I will give you another. A
          drunkard woke up one morning from his drunken sleep, with his clothes
          on him just as he had rolled down the night before. He saw his only
          child, his daughter Millie, getting his breakfast. Coming to his
          senses he said to her, |Millie, why do you stay with me?| She
          answered, |Because you are my father, and because I love you.| He
          looked at himself, and saw what a sottish, ragged, good-for-nothing
          creature he was, and he answered her, |Millie, do you really love me?|
          The child cried, |Yes, father, I do, and I will never leave you,
          because when mother died she said, Millie, stick to your father, and
          always pray for him, and one of these days he will give up drink, and
          be a good father to you'; so I will never leave you.| Is it wonderful
          when I add that, as the story has it, Millie's father cast away his
          drink, and became a Christian man? It would have been more remarkable
          if he had not. Millie was trying free grace, was she not? According to
          our moralists she should have said, |Father, you are a horrible
          wretch! I have stuck to you long enough: I must now leave you, or else
          I shall be encouraging other fathers to get drunk.| Under such proper
          dealing I fear Millie's father would have continued a drunkard till he
          drank himself into perdition. But the power of love made a better man
          of him. Do not these instances prove that undeserved love has a great
          influence for good?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear another story: In the old persecuting times there lived in
          Cheapside one who feared God and attended the secret meetings of the
          saints; and near him there dwelt a poor cobbler, whose wants were
          often relieved by the merchant; but the poor man was a cross-grained
          being, and, most ungratefully, from hope of reward, laid an
          information against his kind friend on the score of religion. This
          accusation would have brought the merchant to death by burning if he
          had not found a means of escape. Returning to his house, the injured
          man did not change his generous behaviour to the malignant cobbler,
          but, on the contrary, was more liberal than ever. The cobbler was,
          however, in an ill mood, and avoided the good man with all his might,
          running away at his approach. One day he was obliged to meet him face
          to face, and the Christian man asked him gently, |Why do you shun me?
          I am not your enemy. I know all that you did to injure me, but I never
          had an angry thought against you. I have helped you, and I am willing
          to do so as long as I live, only let us be friends.| Do you marvel
          that they clasped hands? Would you wonder if ere long the poor man was
          found at the Lollards' meeting? All such anecdotes rest upon the
          assured fact that grace has a strange subduing power, and leads men to
          goodness, drawing them with cords of love, and bands of a man. The
          Lord knows that bad as men are the key of their hearts hangs on the
          nail of love. He knows that his almighty goodness, though often
          baffled, will triumph in the end. I believe my point is proved. To
          myself it is so. However, we must pass on.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. There is no fear that the doctrine of the grace of God will lead
          men to sin, because ITS OPERATIONS ARE CONNECTED WITH A SPECIAL
          REVELATION OF THE EVIL OF SIN. Iniquity is made to be exceeding bitter
          before it is forgiven or when it is forgiven. When God begins to deal
          with a man with a view of blotting out his sins and making him his
          child, he usually causes him to see his evil ways in all their
          heinousness; he makes him look on sin with fixed eyes, till he cries
          with David, |My sin is ever before me.| In my own case, when under
          conviction of sin, no cheering object met my mental eye, my soul saw
          only darkness and a horrible tempest. It seemed as though a horrible
          spot were painted on my eyeballs. Guilt, like a grim chamberlain, drew
          the curtains of my bed, so that I rested not, but in my slumbers
          anticipated the wrath to come. I felt that I had offended God, and
          that this was the most awful thing a human being could do. I was out
          of order with my Creator, out of order with the universe; I had damned
          myself for ever, and I wondered that I did not immediately feel the
          gnawing of the undying worm. Even to this hour a sight of sin causes
          the most dreadful emotions in my heart. Any man or woman here who has
          passed through that experience, or anything like it, will henceforth
          feel a deep horror of sin. A burnt child dreads the fire. |No,| says
          the sinner to his tempter, |you once deceived me, and I so smarted in
          consequence, that I will not again be deluded. I have been delivered,
          like a brand from the burning, and I cannot go back to the fire.| By
          the operations of grace we are made weary of sin; we loathe both it
          and its imaginary pleasures. We would utterly exterminate it from the
          soil of our nature. It is a thing accursed, even as Amalek was to
          Israel. If you, my friend, do not detest every sinful thing, I fear
          you are still in the gall of bitterness; for one of the sure fruits of
          the Spirit is a love of holiness, and a loathing of every false way. A
          deep inward experience forbids the child of God to sin: he has known
          within himself its judgment and its condemnation, and henceforth it is
          a thing abhorrent to him. An enmity both fierce and endless exists
          between the chosen seed and the serpent brood of evil: hence the fear
          that grace will be abused is abundantly safeguarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Remember also that not only is the forgiven man thus set against
          sin by the process of conviction, but EVERY MAN WHO TASTES OF THE
          SAVING GRACE OF GOD IS MADE A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS. Now if the
          doctrine of grace in the hands of an ordinary man might be dangerous,
          yet it would cease to be so in the hands of one who is quickened by
          the Spirit, and created anew in the image of God. The Holy Spirit
          comes upon the chosen one, and transforms him: his ignorance is
          removed, his affections are changed, his understanding is enlightened,
          his will is subdued, his desires are refined, his life is changed --
          in fact, he is as one new-born, to whom all things have become new.
          This change is compared in Scripture to the resurrection from the
          dead, to a creation, and to a new birth. This takes place in every man
          who becomes a partaker of the free grace of God. |Ye must be born
          again,| said Christ to Nicodemus; and gracious men are born again. One
          said the other day, |If I believed that I was eternally saved, I
          should live in sin.| Perhaps you would; but if you were renewed in
          heart you would not. |But,| says one, |if I believed God loved me from
          before the foundation of the world, and that therefore I should be
          saved, I would take a full swing of sin.| Perhaps you and the devil
          would; but God's regenerate children are not of so base a nature. To
          them the abounding grace of the Father is a bond to righteousness
          which they never think of breaking: they feel the sweet constraints of
          sacred gratitude, and desire to perfect holiness in the fear of the
          Lord. All beings live according to their nature, and the regenerated
          man works out the holy instincts of his renewed mind: crying after
          holiness, warring against sin, labouring to be pure in all things, the
          regenerate man puts forth all his strength towards that which is pure
          and perfect. A new heart makes all the difference. Given a new nature,
          and then all the propensities run in a different way, and the
          blessings of almighty love no longer involve peril, but suggest the
          loftiest aspirations.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. One of the chief securities for the holiness of the pardoned is
          found in the way of CLEANSING THROUGH ATONEMENT. The blood of Jesus
          sanctifies as well as pardons. The sinner learns that his free pardon
          cost the life of his best Friend; that in order to his salvation the
          Son of God himself agonized even to a bloody sweat, and died forsaken
          of his God. This causes a sacred mourning for sin, as he looks upon
          the Lord whom he pierced. Love to Jesus burns within the pardoned
          sinner's breast, for the Lord is his Redeemer; and therefore he feels
          a burning indignation against the murderous evil of sin. To him all
          manner of evil is detestable, since it is stained with the Saviour's
          heart's blood. As the penitent sinner hears the cry of, |Eloi,
          sabachthani!| he is horrified to think that one so pure and good
          should be forsaken of heaven because of the sin which he bore in his
          people's stead. From the death of Jesus the mind draws the conclusion
          that sin is exceedingly sinful in the sight of the Lord; for if
          eternal justice would not spare even the Well-beloved Jesus when
          imputed sin was upon him, how much less will it spare guilty men? It
          must be a thing unutterably full of poison which could make even the
          immaculate Jesus suffer so terribly. Nothing can be imagined which can
          have greater power over gracious minds than the vision of a crucified
          Saviour denouncing sin by all his wounds, and by every falling drop of
          blood. What! live in the sin which slew Jesus? Find pleasure in that
          which wrought his death? Trifle with that which laid his glory in the
          dust? Impossible! Thus you see that the gifts of free grace, when
          handed down by a pierced hand, are never likely to suggest
          self-indulgence in sin, but the very reverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Sixthly, a man who becomes a partaker of divine grace, and
          receives the new nature, is ever afterwards A PARTAKER OF DAILY HELPS
          FROM GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT. God the Holy Ghost deigns to dwell in the
          bosom, of every man whom God has saved by his grace. Is not that a
          wonderful means of sanctifying? By what process can men be better kept
          from sin than by having the Holy Spirit himself to dwell as
          Vice-regent within their hearts? The Ever- blessed Spirit leads
          believers to be much in prayer, and what a power for holiness is found
          in the child of grace speaking to the heavenly Father! The tempted man
          flies to his chamber, unbosoms his grief to God, looks to the flowing
          wounds of his Redeemer, and comes down strong to resist temptation.
          The divine word also, with its precepts and promises, is a
          never-failing source of sanctification. Were it not that we every day
          bathe in the sacred fountain of eternal strength we might soon be weak
          and irresolute; but fellowship with God renews us in our vigorous
          warfare with sin. How is it possible that the doctrines of grace
          should suggest sin to men who constantly draw near to God? The renewed
          man is also by God's Spirit frequently quickened in conscience; so
          that things which heretofore did not strike him as sinful are seen in
          a clearer light, and are consequently condemned. I know that certain
          matters are sinful to me today which did not appear so ten years ago:
          my judgment has, I trust, been more and more cleared of the blindness
          of sin. The natural conscience is callous and hard; but the gracious
          conscience grows more and more tender till at last it becomes as
          sensitive as a raw wound. He who has most grace is most conscious of
          his need of more grace. The gracious are often afraid to put one foot
          before another for fear of doing wrong. Have you not felt this holy
          fear, this sacred caution? It is by this means that the Holy Spirit
          prevents your ever turning your Christian liberty into licentiousness,
          or daring to make the grace of God an argument for folly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in addition to this, the good Spirit leads us into high and
          hallowed intercourse with God, and I defy a man to live upon the mount
          with God, and then come down to transgress like men of the world. If
          thou hast walked the palace floor of glory, and seen the King in his
          beauty, till the light of his countenance has been thy heaven, thou
          canst not be content with the gloom and murkiness of the tents of
          wickedness. To lie, to deceive, to feign, as the men of the world do,
          will no longer beseem thee. Thou art of another race, and thy
          conversation is above them: |Thy speech betrayeth thee.| If thou dost
          indeed dwell with God, the perfume of the ivory palaces will be about
          thee, and men will know that thou hast been in other haunts than
          theirs. If the child of God goes wrong in any degree, he loses to some
          extent the sweetness of his communion, and only as he walks carefully
          with God does he enjoy full fellowship; so that this rising or falling
          in communion becomes a sort of parental discipline in the house of the
          Lord. We have no court with a judge, but we have home with its
          fatherhood, its smile and its rod. We lack not for order in the family
          of love, for our Father dealeth with us as with sons. Thus, in a
          thousand ways, all danger of our presuming upon the grace of God is
          effectually removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. THE ENTIRE ELEVATION OF THE MAN WHO IS MADE A PARTAKER OF THE
          GRACE OF GOD is also a special preservative against sin. I venture to
          say, though it may be controverted, that the man who believes the
          glorious doctrines of grace is usually a much higher style of man than
          the person who has no opinion upon the matter. What do most men think
          about? Bread-and-butter, house-rent and clothes. But the men who
          consider the doctrines of the gospel muse upon the everlasting
          covenant, predestination, immutable love, effectual calling, God in
          Christ Jesus, the work of the Spirit, justification, sanctification,
          adoption, and such like noble themes. Why, it is a refreshment merely
          to look over the catalogue of these grand truths! Others are as
          children playing with little sand-heaps on the seashore; but the
          believer in free grace walks among hills and mountains. The themes of
          thought around him tower upward, Alps on Alps; the man's mental
          stature rises with his surroundings, and he becomes a thoughtful
          being, communing with sublimities. No small matter this, for a thing
          so apt to grovel as the average human intellect. So far as deliverance
          from mean vices and degrading lusts must in this way be promoted, I
          say, it is no small thing. Thoughtlessness is the prolific mother of
          iniquity. It is a hopeful sign when minds begin to roam among lofty
          truths. The man who has been taught of God to think will not so
          readily sin as the being whose mind is buried beneath his flesh. The
          man has now obtained a different view of himself from that which led
          him to trifle away his time with the idea that there was nothing
          better for him than to be merry while he could. He says, |I am one of
          God's chosen, ordained to be his son, his heir, joint-heir with Jesus
          Christ. I am set apart to be a king and priest unto God, and as such I
          cannot be godless, nor live for the common objects of life.| He rises
          in the object of his pursuit: he cannot henceforth live unto himself,
          for he is not his own, he is bought with a price. Now he dwells in the
          presence of God, and life to him is real, earnest, and sublime. He
          cares not to scrape together gold with the muck-rake of the covetous,
          for he is immortal, and must needs seek eternal gains. He feels that
          he is born for divine purposes, and enquires |Lord, what wouldst thou
          have me to do?| He feels that God has loved him that his love may flow
          forth to others. God's choice of any one man has a bearing upon all
          the rest: he elects a Joseph that a whole family, a whole nation, nay,
          the whole world, may be preserved alive when famine had broken the
          staff of bread. We are each one as a lamp kindled that we may shine in
          the dark, and light up other lamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          New hopes come crowding on the man who is saved by grace. His immortal
          spirit enjoys glimpses of the endless. As God has loved him in time,
          he believes that the like love will bless him in eternity. He knows
          that his Redeemer lives, and that in the latter days he shall behold
          him; and therefore he has no fears for the future. Even while here
          below he begins to sing the songs of the angels, for his spirit spies
          from afar the dawn of the glory which is yet to be revealed. Thus with
          joyous heart and light footstep he goes forward to the unknown future
          as merrily as to a wedding-feast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a sinner here, a guilty sinner, one who has no merit, no
          claim to mercy whatever; is there one willing to be saved by God's
          free grace through believing in Jesus Christ? Then let me tell thee,
          sinner, there is not a word in God's book against thee, not a line or
          syllable, but everything is in thy favour. |This is a faithful saying,
          and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world
          to save sinners,| even the chief. Jesus came into the world to save
          thee. Only do thou trust him, and rest in him. I will tell thee what
          ought to fetch thee to Christ at once, it is the thought of his
          amazing love. A profligate son had been a great grief to his father;
          he had robbed him and disgraced him, and at last he ended by bringing
          his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. He was a horrible wretch of a
          son: no one could have been more graceless. However, he attended his
          father's funeral, and he stayed to hear the will read: perhaps it was
          the chief reason why he was there. He had fully made up his mind that
          his father would cut him off with a shilling, and he meant to make it
          very unpleasant for the rest of the family. To his great astonishment,
          as the will was read it ran something like this: |As for my son
          Richard, though he has fearfully wasted my substance, and though he
          has often grieved my heart, I would have him know that I consider him
          still to be my own dear child, and therefore, in token of my undying
          love, I leave him the same share as the rest of his brothers.| He left
          the room; he could not stand it, the surprising love of his father had
          mastered him. He came down to the executor the next morning, and said,
          |You surely did not read correctly?| |Yes I did; there it stands.|
          |Then,| he said, |I feel ready to curse myself that I ever grieved my
          dear old father. Oh, that I could fetch him back again!| Love was born
          in that base heart by an unexpected display of love. May not your case
          be similar? Our Lord Jesus Christ is dead, but he has left it in his
          will that the chief of sinners are objects of his choicest mercy.
          Dying he prayed, |Father, forgive them.| Risen he pleads for
          transgressors. Sinners are ever on his mind: their salvation is his
          great object. His blood is for them, his heart for them, his
          righteousness for them, his heaven for them. Come, O ye guilty ones,
          and receive your legacy. Put out the hand of faith and grasp your
          portion. Trust Jesus with your souls, and he will save you. God bless
          you. Amen.
