        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.246)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 3rd, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?| -- Matthew
          14:31.
        </p>
        <p>
          TT SEEMS AS if doubt were doomed to be the perpetual companion of
          faith. As dust attends the chariotwheels so do doubts naturally
          becloud faith. Some men of little faith are perpetually enshrouded
          with fears; their faith seems only strong enough to enable them to
          doubt. If they had no faith at all, then they would not doubt, but
          having that little, and but so little, they are perpetually involved
          in distressing surmises, suspicions, and fears. Others, who have
          attained to great strength and stability of faith, are nevertheless,
          at times, subjects of doubt. He who has a colossal faith will
          sometimes find that the clouds of fear float over the brow of his
          confidence. It is not possible, I suppose, so long as man is in this
          world, that he should be perfect in anything; and surely it seems to
          be quite impossible that he should be perfect in faith. Sometimes,
          indeed, the Lord purposely leaves his children, withdraws the divine
          inflowings of his grace, and permits them to begin to sink, in order
          that they may understand that faith is not their own work, but is at
          first the gift of God, and must always be maintained and kept alive in
          the heart by the fresh influence of the Holy Spirit. I take it that
          Peter was a man of great faith. When others doubted, Peter believed.
          He boldly avowed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God,
          for which faith he received the Master's commendation, |Blessed art
          thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
          thee, but my Father which is in heaven.| He was of faith so strong,
          that at Christ's command he could tread the billow and find it like
          glass beneath his feet, yet even he was permitted in this thing to
          fall. Faith forsook him, he looked at the winds and the waves, and
          began to sink, and the Lord said to him, |O thou of little faith,
          wherefore didst thou doubt?| As much as to say, |O Peter, thy great
          faith is my gift, and the greatness of it is my work. Think not that
          thou art the author of thine own faith; I will leave thee, and this
          great faith of thine shall speedily disappear, and like another who
          hath no faith, thou shalt believe the winds, and regard the waves, but
          shalt distrust thy Master's power, and therefore shalt thou sink.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I shall be quite safe in concluding this morning, that there
          are some here who are full of doubting and fearing. Sure I am that all
          true Christians have their times of anxious questioning. The heart
          that hath never doubted has not yet learned to believe. As the farmers
          say, |The land that will not grow a thistle, will not grow wheat;| and
          the heart that cannot produce a doubt has not yet understood the
          meaning of believing. He that never doubted of his state -- he may,
          perhaps he may, too late. Yes, there may be timid ones here, those who
          are always of little faith, and there may be also great hearts, those
          who are valiant for truth, who are now enduring seasons of despondency
          and hours of darkness of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in endeavoring to comfort you this morning, I would remark that
          the text goes upon a very wise principle. If a man believes in
          anything it is always proper to put to him the question, |Why do you
          believe? What evidence have you that what you believe is certainly
          correct?| We believe on evidence. Now the most foolish part of many
          men's doubts, is, that they do not doubt on evidence. If you should
          put to them the question, |Why do you doubt?| -- they would not be
          able fairly to answer. Yet mark, if men's doubts be painful, the
          wisest way to remove them is by simply seeing whether they have a firm
          basis. |O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?| If you
          believe a thing you want evidence, and before you doubt a thing you
          ought to have evidence too. To believe without evidence is to be
          credulous, and to doubt without evidence is to be foolish. We should
          have ground for our doubts as well as a basis for our faith. The text,
          therefore, goes on a most excellent principle, and it deals with all
          doubting minds by asking them this question, |O thou of little faith,
          wherefore didst thou doubt?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavor to exhort you on the same plan this morning. I shall
          divide only sermon into two parts. First, I shall address myself to
          those of you who are in great trouble with regard to temporal
          circumstances, you are God's people, but you are sorely tried, and you
          have begun to doubt. I shall then deal with you upon spiritual matters
          -- there are some here who are God's true, quickened, and living
          people, but they are doubting -- to them also I shall put the same
          question, |O thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, in TEMPORAL CIRCUMSTANCES, God has not made for his
          people a smooth path to heaven. Before they are crowned they must
          fight; before they can enter the celestial city they must fulfill a
          weary pilgrimage. Religion helps us in trouble, but it does not suffer
          us to escape from it. It is through much tribulation that we inherit
          the kingdom. Now the Christian when he is full of faith passes through
          affliction with a song in his mouth; he would enter the fiery furnace
          itself, fearless of the devouring flame, or with Jonah he would
          descend into the great deeps, unalarmed at the hungry sea. As long as
          faith maintains its hold, fear is a stranger; but at times, during
          sundry great and sore troubles, the Christian begins to fear that
          surely at last he shall be overcome, and shall be left to himself to
          die and perish in despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what is the reason why you doubt? I must come to the plan of the
          text and put the great question, |O thou of little faith, wherefore
          dost thou doubt?| Here it will be proper for us to enquire: Why did
          Simon Peter doubt? He doubted for two reasons. First, because he
          looked too much to second causes and secondly, because be looked too
          little at the first cause. The answer will suit you also, my trembling
          brother. This is the reason why you doubt, because you are looking too
          much to the things that are seen, and too little to your unseen Friend
          who is behind your troubles and who shall come forth for your
          deliverance. See poor Peter in the ship -- his Master bids him come;
          in a moment he casts himself into the sea, and to his own surprise he
          finds himself walking the billows. He looks down, and actually it is
          the fact; his foot is upon a crested wave, and yet he stands erect; he
          treads again, and yet his footing is secure. |Oh!| thinks Peter, |this
          is marvellous.| He begins to wonder within his spirit what manner of
          man he must be who has enabled him thus to tread the treacherous deep;
          but just then, there comes howling across the sea a terrible blast of
          wind; it whistles in the ear of Peter, and he says within himself,
          |Ah! here comes an enormous billow driven forward by the blast now,
          surely, I must, I shall be overwhelmed.| No sooner does the thought
          enter his heart than down he goes; and the waves begin to enclose him.
          So long as he shut his eye to the billow, and to the blast, and kept
          it only open to theLord who stood there before him, he did not sink;
          but the moment he shut his eye on Christ, and looked at the stormy
          wind and treacherous deep, down he went. He might have traversed the
          leagues of the Atlantic, he might have crossed the broad Pacific, if
          he could but have kept his eye on Christ, and ne'er a billow would
          have yielded to his tread, but he might have been drowned in a very
          brook if he began to look at second causes, and to forget the Great
          Head and Master of the Universe who had bidden him walk the sea. I
          say, the very reason of Peter's doubt was, that he looked at second
          causes and not at the first cause. Now, that is the reason why you
          doubt. Let me just probe you now for a while. You are in despondency
          about temporal affairs: what is the reason why you are in trouble?
          |Because,| say you, |I never was in such a condition before in my
          life. Wave upon wave of trouble comes upon me. I have lost one friend
          and then another. It seems as if business had altogether run away from
          me. Once I had a flood-tide, and now it is an ebb, and my poor ship
          grates upon the gravel, and I find she has not water enough to float
          her -- what will become of me? And, oh! sir, my enemies have conspired
          against me in every way to cut me up and destroy me; opposition upon
          opposition threatens me. My shop must be closed; bankruptcy stares me
          in the face, and I know not what is to become of me.| Or else your
          troubles take another shape, and you feel that you are called to some
          eminently arduous service for your Lord, and your strength is utterly
          insignificant compared with the labor before you. If you had great
          faith it would be as much as you could do to accomplish it; but with
          your poor little faith you are completely beaten. You cannot see how
          you can accomplish the matter at all. Now, what is all this but simply
          looking at second causes? You are looking at your trouble, not at the
          God who sent your trouble; you are looking at yourselves, not at the
          God who dwells within you, and who has promised to sustain you. O
          soul! it were enough to make the mightiest heart doubt, if it should
          look only at things that are seen. He that is nearest to the kingdom
          of heaven would have cause to droop and die if he had nothing to look
          at but that which eye can see and ear can ear. What wonder then if
          thou art disconsolate, when thou hast begun to look at the things
          which always must be enemies to faith?
        </p>
        <p>
          But I would remind you that you have forgotten to look to Christ since
          you have been in this trouble. Let me ask you, have you not thought
          less of Christ than you ever did? I will not suppose that you have
          neglected prayer, or have left your Bible unread; but still, have you
          had any of those sweet thoughts of Christ which once you had? Have you
          been able to take all your troubles to him and say -- |Lord, thou
          knowest all things; I trust all in thy hands?| Let me ask you, have
          you considered that Christ is omnipotent, and therefore able to
          deliver you; that he is faithful, and must deliver you, because he has
          promised to do so? Have you not kept your eye on his rod, and not on
          his hand? Have you not looked rather to the crook that smote you, than
          to the heart that moved that crook? Oh, recollect, that you can never
          find joy and peace while you are looking at the things that are seen,
          the secood causes of your trouble; your only hope, your only refuge
          and joy must be to look to him who dwells within the veil. Peter sunk
          when he looked to outward providences, so must you. He would never
          have ceased to walk the wave, never would he have begun to sink, if he
          had looked alone to Christ, nor will you if you will look alone to
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here let me now begin to argue with such of you as are the people
          of God, who are in sore trouble lest Christ should leave you to sink.
          Let me forbid your fears by a few words of consolation. You are now in
          Peter's condition; you are like Peter; you are Christ's servant.
          Christ is a good master. You have never heard that he suffered one of
          his servants to be drowned when going on his errands. Will he not take
          care of his own? Shall it be said at last that one of Christ's
          disciples perished while he was in obedience to Christ. I say he were
          a bad master if he should send you on an errand that would involve
          your destruction. Peter, when he was in the water, was where his
          master had called him to be, and vou in your trouble now, are not only
          Christ's servant, but you are where Christ has chosen to put you. Your
          afflictions, remember, come neither from the east nor from the west,
          neither doth your trouble grow out of the ground. All your suffering
          is sent upon you by your God. The medicine which you now drink is
          compounded in heaven. Every grain of this bitterness which now fills
          your mouth was measured by the heavenly physician. There is not an
          ounce more trouble in your cup, than God chose to put there. Your
          burden was weighed by God before you were called to bear it. The Lord
          who gave you the mercy has taken it away; the same God who has blessed
          you with joy is he that hath now ploughed you with grief. You are
          where God put you. Ask yourself this question then: -- Can it be
          possible that Christ would put his own servant into a perilous
          condition and then leave him there? I have heard of fiends, in fables,
          tempting men into the sea to drown them; but is Christ a syren? Will
          he entice his people on to the rocks? Will he tempt them into a place
          where he shall destroy them? God forbid. If Christ calls thee into the
          fire, he will bring thee out of it; and if he bids thee walk the sea,
          he will enable thee to tread it in safety. Doubt not, soul; if thou
          hadst come there of thyself, then thou mightest fear, but since Christ
          put thee there, he will bring thee out again. Let this be the pillar
          of thy confidence -- thou art his servant, he wilt not leave thee;
          thou art where he put thee, he cannot suffer thee to perish. Look
          away, then, from the trouble that surrounds thee, to thy Master, and
          to his hand that hath planned all these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember too, who it is that hath thee where thou art. It is no harsh
          tyrant who has led thee into trouble. It is no austere unloving heart
          who hath bidden thee pass through this difficulty to gratify a
          capricious whim. Ah, no, he who troubles thee is Christ. Remember his
          bleeding hand; and canst thou think that the hand which dropped with
          gore can ever hang down when it should be stretched for thy
          deliverance? Think of the eye that wept over thee on the cross; and
          can the eye that wept for thee be blind when thou art in grief? Think
          of the heart that was opened for thee; and shall the heart that did
          bleed its life away to rescue thee from death, be hard and stolid when
          thou art overwhelmed in sorrow? It is Christ, that stands on yonder
          billow in the midst of the tempest with thee. He is suffering as well
          as thou art. Peter is not the only one walking on the sea; his master
          is there with him too. And so is Jesus with thee to-day, with thee in
          thy troubles, suffering with thee as he suffered for thee. Shall he
          leave thee, he that bought thee, he who is married to thee, he that
          hath led thee thus far, hath succoured thee hitherto he who loves thee
          better than he loves himself, shall he forsake thee? O turn thine eyes
          from the rough billow, listen no longer to the howling tempest, turn
          thine eyes to him thy loving Lord, thy faithful friend, and fix thy
          trust on him, who even now in the midst of the tempest, cries, |It is
          I, be not afraid.|
        </p>
        <p>
          One other reflection will I offer to such of you as are now in sore
          trouble on account of temporal matters, and it is this -- Christ has
          helped you hitherto. Should not this console you? Ah, Peter, why
          couldest thou fear that thou shouldest sink? It was miracle enough
          that thou didst not sink at first. What power is it that hath held
          thee up till now? Certainly not thine own. Thou hadst fallen at once
          to the bottom of the sea, O man, if God had not been thy helper; if
          Jesus had not made thee buoyant, Peter, thou wouldest soon have been a
          floating carcase. He who helped thee then to walk so long as thou
          couldest walk, surely he is able to help thee all the way until he
          shall grasp thy hand in Paradise to glorify thee with himself. Let any
          Christian look back to his past life, and he will be astonished that
          he is what he is and where he is. The whole Christian life is a series
          of miracles, wonders linked into wonders, in one perpetual chain.
          Marvel, believer, that thou hast been upheld till now; and cannot he
          that hath kept thee to this day preserve thee to the end? What is yon
          roaring wave that threatens to overwhelm thee -- what is it? why thou
          hast endured greater waves than these in the past. What is yon howling
          blast? Why, he has saved thee when the wind was howling worse than
          that. He that helped thee in six troubles will not forsake thee in
          this. He who hath delivered thee out of the paw of the lion and out of
          the paw of the bear, he will not, he cannot forsake thee now.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all this, I have labored to turn your eyes from what you are seeing
          to that which you cannot see, but in which you must believe. Oh! if I
          might but be successful, though feeble my words, yet mighty should be
          the consolation which should flow therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>
          A minister of Christ, who was always in the habit of visiting those
          whom he knew to be eminent for piety, in order that he might learn
          from them, called upon an aged Christian who had been distinguished
          for his holiness. To his great surprise, however, when he sat down by
          his bedside, the erred man said, |Ah! I have lost my way. I did think
          at one time that I was a child of God, now I find that I have been a
          stumbling-block to others; for these forty years I have deceived the
          church and deceived myself, and now I discover that I am a lost soul.|
          The minister very wisely said to him, |Ah! then I suppose you like the
          song of the drunkard and you are very fond of the amusements of the
          world and delight in profanity and sin?| |Ah! no,| said he, |I cannot
          bear them, I could not endure to sin against God.| |O then,| said the
          minister, |then it is not at all likely that God will lock you up in
          hell with men that you cannot bear here. If now you hate sin, depend
          on it God will not shut you up for ever with sinners. But, my
          brother,| said the minister |tell me what has brought you into such a
          distressed state of mind?| |O sir, |said he, |it was looking away from
          the God of providence, to myself I had managed to save about one
          hundred pounds, and I have been lying here ill now this last six
          months, and I was thinking that my one hundred pounds would soon be
          spent, and then what should I do. I think I shall have to go to the
          workhouse, I have no friend to take care of me, and I have been
          thinking about that one hundred pounds of mine. I knew it would soon
          be gone, and then, then, how could the Lord provide for me. I never
          had either doubt or fear till I began to think about temporal matters.
          The time was when I could leave all that with God. If I had not had
          one hundred pounds, I should have felt quite sure he would provide for
          me; but I begin to think now that I cannot provide for myself. The
          moment I think of that, my heart is darkened.| The minister then led
          him away from all trust in an arm of flesh, and told him his
          dependence for bread and water was not on his one hundred pounds, but
          on the God who is the possessor of heaven and earth -- that as for his
          bread being given him and his water being sure God would take care of
          that, for in so doing he would only be fulfilling his promise. The
          poor man was enabled in the matter of providence to cast himself
          entirely upon God, and then his doubts and fears subsided, and once
          more he began to walk the sea of trouble, and did not sink. O
          believer, if thou takest thy business into thine own hands, thou wilt
          soon be in trouble. The old Puritan said, |He that carves for himself
          will soon cut his fingers,| and I believe it. There never was a man
          who began to take his own matters out of God's hand that was not glad
          enough to take them back again. He that runs before the cloud runs a
          fool's errand. If we leave all our matters, temporal as well as
          spiritual, in the hand of God, we shall lack no good thing, and what
          is better still, we shall have no care, no trouble, no thought; we
          shall cast all our burden upon him for he careth for us. There is no
          need for two to care, for God to care and the creature too. If the
          Creator cares for us, then the creature may sing all day long with joy
          and gladness: --
        </p>
        <p>|Mortals cease from toil and sorrow,</p>
        <p>God provideth for the morrow.|</p>
        <p>
          II. But now, in the second part of the discourse, I have to speak of
          SPIRITIUAL THINGS. To the Christian, these are the causes of more
          trouble than all his temporal trials. In the matters of the soul and
          of eternity many doubts will arise. I shall, however, divide them into
          two sorts -- doubts of our present acceptance, and doubts of our final
          perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many there are of God's people who are much vexed and troubled with
          doubts about their present acceptance. |Oh,| say they |there was a
          time when I knew I was a child of God; I was sure that I was Christ's,
          my heart would fly up to heaven at a word; I looked to Christ hanging
          on the cross, I fixed all my trust on him, and a sweet, calm, and
          blessed repose filled my spirit.
        </p>
        <p>|What peaceful hours I then enjoyed;</p>
        <p>How sweet their memory still!</p>
        <p>But they have left an aching void,</p>
        <p>The world can never fill.'</p>
        <p>
          And now,| saith this doubting one, |now I am afraid I never knew the
          Lord; I think that I have deceived myself, and that I have been a
          hypocrite. Oh that I could but know that I am Christ's, I would give
          all I had in the world, if he would but let me know that he is my
          beloved, and that I am his.| Now, soul, I will deal with thee as I
          have been just now treating of Peter. Thy doubts arise from looking to
          second causes, and not to Christ. Let us see if this is not the truth.
          Why do you doubt? Your answer is, |I doubt, because I feel my sin so
          much. Oh, what sins have I committed! When first I came to Christ I
          thought I was the chief of sinners; but now I know I am. Day after day
          I have added to my guilt; and since my pretended conversion,| says
          this doubting one, |I have been a bigger sinner than ever I was
          before. I have sinned against light and against knowledge, against
          grace, and mercy, and favor. O never was there such a sinner under
          God's heaven out of hell as I am.| But, soul, is not this looking to
          second causes? It is true, thou art the chief of sinners; take that
          for granted, let us not dispute it. Thy sins are as evil as thou
          sayest they are, and a great deal more so. Depend on it, thou art
          worse than thou thinkest thyself to be. Thou thinkest thou art bad
          enough, but thou art not so bad in thine own estimation as thou really
          art. Thy sins seem to thee to be like roaring billows, but in God's
          sight they are like towering mountains without summit. Thou seemest to
          thyself to be black -- black as the tents of Kedar; in God's eyes thou
          art blacker still. Set that down, to begin with, that the waves are
          big, and that the winds are howling, I will not dispute that. I ask
          thee, what hast thou to do with that? Does not the Word of God command
          thee to look to Christ. Great as thy sins are, Christ is greater than
          they all. They are black; but his blood can wash thee whiter than
          snow. I know thy sins deserve damnation; but Christ's merits deserve
          salvation. It is true, the pit of hell is thy lawful portion, but
          heaven itself is thy gracious portion. What! is Christ less powerful
          than thy sin? That cannot be! To suppose that were that to make the
          creature mightier than the Creator. What! is thy guilt more prevalent
          with God than Christ's righteousness? Canst thou think so little of
          Christ as to imagine that thy sins can overwhelm and conquer him? O
          man, thy sins are like mountains; but Christ's love is like Noah's
          flood; it prevaileth twenty cubits, and the tops of the mountains are
          covered. It Is looking at sin and not looking to the Saviour that has
          made thee doubt. Thou art looking to the second cause, and not to him
          who is greater than all.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Nay, but,| you reply, |it is not my sin, sir, that grieves me; it is
          this: I feel so hardened, I do not feel my sin as I ought. Oh if I
          could but weep as some weep! If I could but pray as some pray! Then I
          think I could be saved. If I could feel some of the terrors that good
          men have felt, then I think I could believe. But I feel none of these
          things. My heart seems like a rock of ice, hard as granite, and as
          cold as an iceberg. It will not melt. You may preach, but it is not
          affected; I may pray, but my heart seems dumb, I may read even the
          story of Christ's death, and yet my soul is not moved by it. Oh surely
          I cannot be saved!| Ah this is looking to second causes, again! Hast
          thou forgotten that Word which saith, |God is greater than our
          hearts?| Hast thou forgotten that? O child of God! shame on thee that
          thou dost look for comfort where comfort never can be found. Look to
          thyself for peace! Why, there ne'er can be any in this land of war.
          Look to thine own heart for joy! There can be none there, in this
          barren wilderness of sin. Turn, turn thine eye to Christ: he can
          cleanse thine heart, he can create life, and light, and truth in the
          inward parts; he can wash thee till thou shalt be whiter than snow,
          and cleanse thy soul and quicken it, and make it live, and feel, and
          move, so that it shall hear his simplest words, and obey his whispered
          mandate. O look not now at the second cause; look thou at the great
          first cause; otherwise I shall put to thee again the question, |O thou
          of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubts|
        </p>
        <p>
          |Still,| says another, |I could believe, notwithstanding my sin and my
          hardness of heart; but, do you know, that of late I have lost
          communion with Christ to such an extent that I cannot help thinking
          that I must be a cast-away. Oh! sir, there were times when Christ used
          to visit me, and bring me such sweet love-tokens. I was like the
          little ewe lamb in the parable; I did drink out of his cup, and feed
          from his table, and lie in his bosom; often did he take me to his
          banqueting-house, his banner over me was love. What feastings I then
          had! I would bask in the sunlight of his countenance. It was summer
          with my soul. But now it is winter, and the sun is gone, and the
          banqueting-house is closed. No fruits are on the table; no wines are
          in the bottles of the promise; I come to the sanctuary, but I find no
          comfort; I turn to the Bible, but I find no solace; I fall on my
          knees, but even the stream of prayer seems to be a dry brook. Ah!
          soul, but art thou not still looking to second causes? These are the
          most precious of all secondary things, but yet thou must not look to
          them, but to Christ. Remember, it is not thy communing that saves
          thee, but Christ's dying; it is not Christ's comfortable visit to thy
          soul, that ensures thy salvation; it is Christ's own visit to the
          house of mourning, and to the garden of Gethsemane. I would have thee
          keep thy comforts as long as thou canst; but when they die, believe on
          thy God still. Jonah had a gourd once, and when that gourd died he
          began to mourn. Well might some one have said to him, |Jonah! thou
          hast lost thy gourd, but thou hast not lost thy God.| And so might we
          say to you: you have not lost his love; you have lost the light of his
          countenance, but you have not lost the love of his heart; you have
          lost his sweet and gracious communion, but he is the same still, and
          he would have thee believe his faithfulness and trust him in the dark
          and rely upon him in the stormy wind and tempest. Look to none of
          these outward things, but look alone to Christ -- Christ bleeding,
          Christ dying Christ dead, Christ buried, Christ risen, Christ
          ascended, Christ interceding. This is the thing thou art to look to --
          Christ, and him only. And looking there, thou shalt be comforted. But
          look to aught else, and thou shalt begin to sink; like Peter, the
          waves shall fail thee, and thou shalt have to cry, |Lord, save me, or
          I perish.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, to conclude: others of God's people are afraid that they
          shall never be able to persevere and hold out to the end. |Oh!| says
          one, |I know I shall yet fall away and perish, for look! -- look what
          an evil heart of unbelief I have; I cannot live one day without sin;
          my heart is so treacherous, it is like a bomb-shell; let but a spark
          of temptation fall upon it and it will blow up to my eternal
          destruction. With such a tinder-box heart as I have, how can I hope to
          escape, while I walk in the midst of a shower of sparks.| |Oh!| saith
          one, |I feel my nature to be so utterly vile and depraved that I
          cannot hope to persevere. If I hold on a week or a month it will be a
          great work; but to hold on all my life until I die -- oh! this is
          impossible.| Looking to second causes again, are you not? Will you
          please to remember that if you look to creature strength it is utterly
          impossible that you should persevere in grace, even for ten minutes,
          much less for ten years! If your perseverance depends upon yourself
          you are a lost man. You may write that down for a certainty. If you
          have one jot or one tittle to do with your own perseverance in divine
          grace you will never see God's face at last; your grace will die out;
          your life will be extinguished, and you must perish, if your salvation
          depends upon yourself. But remember, you have already been kept these
          months and these years: what has done that? Why, divine grace; and the
          divine grace that has held you on for one year can hold you on for a
          century, nay, for an eternity, if it were necessary. He that has begun
          can carry on and must carry on too, otherwise he were false to his
          promise and would deny himself. |Ah! but,| you say, |sir, I cannot
          tell with what temptations I am surrounded; I am in a workshop, where
          everybody laughs at me; I am called nicknames because I follow the
          cause of Christ. I have been able hitherto to put up with their
          rebukes and their jests; but now they are adopting another plan; they
          try to tempt me away from the house of God, and entice me to the
          theater, and to worldly amusements, and I feel that, placed as I am, I
          never can hold on. As well might a spark hope to live in the midst of
          an ocean as for grace to live in my heart.| Ah! but, soul, who has
          made it to live hitherto? What is it that hath helped thee up till now
          to say, |Nay,| to every temptation? Why, the Lord thy Redeemer. Thou
          couldst not have done it so long, if it had not been for him; and he
          that hath helped thee to stand so long will never put thee to shame.
          Why, if thou be a child of God, and thou shouldst fall away and
          perish, what dishonor would be brought on Christ! |Aha!| the devil
          would say, |here is a child of God, and God has turned him out of his
          family, and I have got him in hell at last. Is this what God doth with
          his children -- loves them one day, and hates them the next -- tells
          them he forgives them, and yet punishes them -- accepts them in
          Christ, and yet sends them into hell?| Can that be? Shall it be?
          Never: not while God is God. |Aha!| again, says Satan, |believers have
          eternal life given to them. Here is one that had eternal life, and
          this eternal life has died out. It was not eternal. The promise was a
          lie. It was temporary life; it was not eternal life. Aha!| says he, |I
          have found a flaw in Christ's promise; he gave them only temporary
          life, and called it eternal.| And again, the arch-fiend would say, if
          it were possible for one child of God to perish: |Aha! I have one of
          the jewels of Christ's crown here;| and he would hold it up, and defy
          Christ to his very face, and laugh him to scorn. |This is a jewel that
          thou didst purchase with thine own blood. Here is one that thou didst
          come into the world to save and yet thou couldst not save him. Thou
          didst buy him, and pay for him, and yet I have got him, he was a jewel
          of thy crown, and yet here he is, in the hand of the black prince,
          thine enemy. Aha! king with a damaged crown! thou hast lost one of thy
          jewels.| Can it be so? No, never, and therefore every one that
          believeth is as sure of heaven as if he were there. If thou casteth
          thyself simply on Christ, nor death, nor hell, shall ever destroy
          thee. Remember what good old Mr. Berridge said, when he was met by a
          friend one morning, |How do you do, Mr. Berridge?| |Pretty well, I
          thank you,| said he, |and as sure of heaven as if I were there; for I
          have a solid confidence in Christ.| What a happy man such a man must
          be, who knows and feels that to be true! And yet, if you do not feel
          it, if you are the children of God, I put to you this question,
          |Wherefore dost thou doubt?| Is there not good reason to believe. |O
          thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?| If thou hast
          believed in Christ, saved thou art, and saved thou shalt be, if thou
          hast committed thyself to his hands: |I know in whom I have believed,
          and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
          to him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |Yes.| says one. |this is not the fear that troubles me; my only doubt
          is whether I am a child of God or not.| I finish, therefore, by going
          over the old ground. Soul, if thou wouldst know whether thou art a
          child of God, look not to thyself, but look to Christ. Ye who are here
          to-day, who desire to be saved, but yet fear you never can be, never
          look to yourselves for any ground of acceptance before God. Not self,
          but Jesus; not heart, but Christ; not man, but man's Creator. O
          sinner! think not that thou art to bring anything to Christ to
          recommend thee. Come to him just as thou art. Me wants no good works
          of thine -- no good feelings either. Come, just as thou art. All that
          thou canst want to fit thee for heaven, he has bought for thee, and he
          will give thee; all these freely thou shalt have for the asking. Only
          come, and he will not cast thee away. But do you say, |Oh, I cannot
          believe that Christ is able to save such a sinner as I am. |I reply,
          |O thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?| He has already
          saved sinners as great as thou art; only try him, only try him.
        </p>
        <p>|Venture on him, venture wholly;</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude.|</p>
        <p>
          Try him, try him; and if you find him false, then tell it everywhere
          that Christ was untrue. But that shall never be. Go to him; tell him
          you are a wretched undone soul, without his sovereign grace; ask him
          to have mercy on you. Tell him you are determined, it you do perish,
          that you will perish at the foot of his cross. Go and cling to him, as
          he hangs bleeding there; look him in the face, and say, |Jesus, I have
          no other refuge; if thou spurn me, I am lost; but I will never go from
          thee; I will clasp thee in life, and clasp thee in death, as the only
          rock of my soul's salvation |Depend upon it, you shall not be sent
          empty away; you must, you shall be accepted, if you will simply
          believe. Oh, may God enable you, by the divine influence of his Holy
          Spirit, to believe; and then, shall we not have to put the question,
          |O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?| I pray God now
          apply these words to your comfort. They have been very simple, and
          very homely words; but nevertheless, they will suit simple, homely
          hearts. If God shall bless them, to him be the glory!<br />
