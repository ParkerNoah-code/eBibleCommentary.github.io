        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2001)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-day, January 8th, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; Although I have cast them far
          off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the
          countries, yet will I be to them, as a little sanctuary in the
          countries where they shall come.| -- Ezekiel 11:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE TEXT BEGINS WITH |therefore.| There was a reason for God's
          speaking in this way. It is profitable to trace the why and the
          wherefore of the gracious words of the Lord. The way by which a
          promise comes usually shines with a trail of light. Upon reading the
          connection we observe that those who had been carried captive were
          insulted by those who tarried at Jerusalem. They spoke in a very cruel
          manner to those with whom they should have sympathized. How often do
          prosperous brothers look with scorn on the unfortunate! Did not Job of
          old complain, |He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp
          despised in the thought of him that is at ease|?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord hears the unkind speeches of the prosperous when they speak
          bitterly of those who are plunged in adversity. Read the context --
          |Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred,
          and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants
          of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord: unto us is this
          land given in possession.| This unbrotherly language moved the Lord to
          send the prophet Ezekiel with good and profitable words to the
          children of the captivity. Many a time the cruel word of man has been
          the cause of a tender word from God. Because of the unkindness of
          these people, therefore God, in lovingkindness, addressed in words of
          tender grace those whom they despised. As, in our Saviour's days, the
          opposition of the Pharisees acted upon the Saviour like a steel to the
          flint, and fetched bright sparks of truth out of him, so the
          wickedness of man has often been the cause why the grace of God has
          been more fully revealed. This is some solace when under the severe
          chastisement of human tongues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I am glad of this comfort. I would gladly be at peace with
          all men: I would not unnecessarily utter a word of provocation; but it
          is a world in which you cannot live at peace unless you are willing to
          be unfaithful to your conscience. Offences, therefore, will come. But
          why should we fret unduly under this trial when we perceive that out
          of opposition to the cause of God occasions arise for the grandest
          displays of God's love and power? If from the showers we gain our
          harvests, we will not mourn when the heavens gather blackness, and the
          rain pours down. If the wrath of man is made to praise the Lord, then
          let man be wrathful if he wills. Brethren, let us brace ourselves to
          bear the bruises of slanderous tongues! Let us take all sharp speeches
          and cutting criticisms to God. It may be that he will hear what the
          enemy has said, and that he will be very pitiful to us. Because of the
          bitterness of the oppressor he will bring home to our heart by the
          Spirit, with greater tenderness and power, some sweet word of his
          which has lain hidden from us in his Book. Be not dismayed, but go to
          him who is the God of all comfort, who comforteth all those that are
          bowed down, and he will give you a word which shall heal your wounds,
          and breathe peace into your spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to proceed at once to our text, seeing that the occasion of it is
          a sufficient preface. Let us notice, first, where God's people may be,
          and yet be God's people. They may be by God's own hand |scattered
          among the countries, and cast far off among the heathen.| And,
          secondly, what God will be to them when they are is such
          circumstances. |Yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the
          countries where they shall come.| May the Holy Spirit, who spake by
          Ezekiel, speak through these words to our hearts!
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, WHERE GOD'S PEOPLE MAY BE.</p>
        <p>
          If you ask where they may be, the answer to the question is, first,
          they may be under chastisment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you will remember, in the Book of Deuteronomy, God threatened
          Israel that if they, as a nation, sinned against him, they should be
          scattered among the nations, and cast far off among the heathen. Many
          a time they so sinned. I need not recapitulate the story of their
          continued transgressions and multiplied backslidings. The Lord was
          slow to fulfil his utmost threatenings, but put forth his utmost
          patience, till there was no more room for long-suffering. At last the
          threatened chastisement fell upon them, and fierce nations carried
          them away in bonds to the far-off lands of their dread. They were not
          utterly destroyed: their being scattered among the people showed that
          they still existed. Though they were a people scattered and peeled,
          yet they were a people, even as Israel is to this day. For all that
          tyrants and persecutors have ever done, yet the Jew is still extant
          among us, even as the bush burned with fire, but was not consumed.
          Israel is still to the front, and will be to the world's end. The Lord
          hath not cast away his people, even though he has cast them far off
          among the heathen. He has scattered them among the countries, but they
          are not absorbed into those countries; they still remain a people
          separated unto the living God, in whom he will yet be glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, assuredly, the chosen seed came under chastisement. When, by the
          rivers of Babylon, they sat down and wept, yea, they wept when they
          remembered Zion, then were they under the Lord's heavy hand. The
          instructed among them knew that their being in exile was the fruit of
          the transgressions of their fathers, and the result of their own
          offences against God. And yet, though they were under chastisement,
          God loved them, and had a choice word for them, which I will by-and-by
          endeavour to explain to you; for the Lord said, |Although I have cast
          them far off among the heathen, yet will I be to them as a little
          sanctuary.| Beloved, you and I may lie under the rod of God, and we
          may smart sorely because of our iniquities, even as David did; and yet
          we may be the children of God towards whom he has thoughts of grace.
          Our moisture may be turned into the drought of summer, while day and
          night the Lord's hand is heavy upon us; we may be in sore temporal
          trouble, and may be compelled by an enlightened conscience to trace
          our sorrow to our own folly. We may be in great spiritual darkness,
          and may be compelled to confess that our own sins have procured this
          unto ourselves. And yet, for all that, the Lord may have sent the
          chastisement in love, and in nothing else but love; and he may intend
          by it, not our destruction, but the destruction of the flesh; not our
          rejection, but our refining, not our curse, but our cleansing. Let us
          take comfort, seeing that God has a word to say to his mourners and to
          his afflicted, and that word in the text is a |yet| which serves to
          show that there is a clear limit to his anger. He smites, but it is
          with an |although| and a |yet|: he scatters them to a distance, but he
          sends a promise after them, and says, |I will be to them as a little
          sanctuary.| In the Lord's hand towards his chosen there may be a rod,
          but not a sword. It is a heavy rod, but it is not a rod of iron. It is
          a rod that bruises, but it is not a rod that batters to pieces. God
          tempers our afflictions, severe though they may seem to be; and
          though, apparently, he strikes us with the blows of a cruel one, yet
          there is a depth unutterable of infinite love in every stroke of his
          hand. His anger endureth but for a night: he hastens to display his
          favour. Listen to his own words of overflowing faithfulness: |For a
          small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I
          gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment;
          but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
          Lord thy Redeemer.| However, it is clear that God's own people may be
          under chastisement.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, secondly, wherever they are, whether they are under chastisement
          or not, they are where the Lord has put them. Read the text carefully:
          |Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I
          have scattered them among the countries.| The Lord's hand was in their
          banishment and dispersion: Jehovah himself inflicted the chastisement
          for sin. You say to me, |Why, it was Nebuchadnezzar who carried them
          away: the Babylonians and the Chaldeans took them captive.| Yes, I
          know it was so; but the Lord regards these as instruments in his hand,
          and he says, |I have done it,| just as Job, when the Chaldeans and the
          Sabeans had swept away his property, and his children had been
          destroyed through the agency of Satan, yet said, |The Lord gave, and
          the Lord hath taken away.| The Lord was as truly in the taking away as
          he was in the giving. It is well to look beyond all second causes and
          instrumentalities. Do not get angry with those who are the nearer
          agents, but look to the First Cause. Do not get fretting about the
          Chaldeans and Sabeans. Let them alone, and Satan too. What have you to
          do with them? Your business is with God. See his hand, and bow before
          it. Say, |The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.| Come to that,
          for then you will be able to say, |Blessed be the name of the Lord.|
          Though your trials be peculiar, and your way be hedged up, yet the
          hand of the Lord is still in everything; and it behoves you to
          recognize it for your strengthening and consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, next, that the people of God may dwell in places of great
          discomfort. The Jews were not in those days like the English, who
          colonize and find a home in the Far West, or even dwell at ease
          beneath sultry skies. An ancient Hebrew out of his own country was a
          fish out of water: out of his proper element. He was not like the
          Tyrian, whose ship went to Tarshish, and passed the Gates of Hercules,
          seeking the Ultima Thule. The Jew tarried at home. | I dwell among
          mine own people,| said a noble woman of that nation; and she did but
          speak the mind of a home-loving people who settled each one upon his
          own patch of ground, and sat down under his vine and fig-tree, none
          making him afraid. Their Lord had driven them into a distant land, to
          rivers whose waters were bitter to their lips, even to the Tigris and
          the Euphrates. They were in a foreign country, where everything was
          different from their ways -- where all the customs of the people were
          strange and singular. They would be a marked and despised people,
          nobody would fraternize with them, but all would pass them by in
          scorn. The Jews excited much prejudice, for, as their great adversary,
          the wicked Haman, said, |their laws were diverse from all people,| and
          their customs had a peculiarity about them which kept them a distinct
          race. It must have been a great discomfort to God's people to dwell
          among idolaters, and to be forced to witness obscene rites and
          revolting practices. God's own favoured ones in these days may be
          living where they are as much out of place as lambs among wolves, or
          doves among hawks. Do not imagine that God makes a nest of down for
          all his eaglets. Why, they would never take to flying if he did not
          put thorns under them, and stir up their nest that they may take to
          their wings, and learn the heavenward flight to which they are
          predestinated! Perfect comfort on earth is no more to be expected than
          constant calm on the sea. Sleep in the midst of a battle, and ease
          when on the march, would be more in place than absolute rest in this
          present state. God meaneth not his children to take up their
          inheritance on this side Jordan. |This is not your rest: because it is
          polluted.| And so he often puts us where we are very uncomfortable. Is
          there any Christian man who can say that he would, if he might, take
          up his lot for ever in this life? No, no. There is an irksomeness
          about our condition, disguise it as we may. In one way or another we
          are made to remember that we are in banishment. We have not yet come
          unto our rest. That rest |remaineth for the people of God,| but as yet
          we have not come into the land which the Lord our God has given to us
          to be our place of rest. Some of God's servants feel this in a very
          peculiar manner, for their soul is among lions, and they dwell among
          those whose tongues are set on fire of hell. Abel was hated by Cain,
          Isaac was mocked by Ishmael, Joseph was among envious brethren, Moses
          was at first rejected by Israel, David was pursued by Saul, Elijah was
          hunted by Jezebel, Mordecai was hated by Haman; and yet these men were
          wisely placed, and the Lord was eminently with them. I mention this in
          order that tried believers may still know that, however uncomfortable
          their position, it is nevertheless true that God has put them there
          for some good end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beloved of God may yet be in a place of great barrenness as to all
          spiritual good. |I have cast them far off among the heathen| -- far
          off from my temple -- far off from the place of my worship -- far off
          from the shrine of my glory. |I have scattered them among the
          countries,| where they will learn no good -- where, on the contrary,
          they will see every abominable thing, and often feel like Lot, who was
          vexed with the filthy conversation of the people among whom he dwelt.
          We are not kept apart from the wicked by high walls, or guards of
          heavenly soldiery. Even our Lord did not pray that we should be taken
          out of the world. Grace builds neither monasteries nor nunneries. |Woe
          is me,| is frequently the cry of God's chosen, |that I sojourn in
          Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!| David knew what it was to
          be cut off from the assemblies of the Lord's house, and to be in the
          cave or in the wilderness. It may be so with you, and yet you may be a
          child of God. You may not be out of your place, for the dear path to
          his abode may go straight through this barren land. You may have to
          pass for many a day through this great and terrible wilderness, this
          land of fiery serpents, and of great drought, on your way to the land
          that floweth with milk and honey. To make heaven the sweeter we may
          find our exile made bitter. Our education for eternity may necessitate
          spiritual tribulation, and bereavement from visible comforts. To be
          weaned from all reliance on outward means may be for our good, that we
          may be driven in upon the Lord, and made to know that he is all in
          all. Doubtless the jeers of Babylon endeared the quiet of Zion to the
          banished: they loved the courts of the Lord's house all the more for
          having sighed in the halls of the proud monarch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse still, the Lord's chosen may be under oppression through
          surrounding ungodliness and sin. The captive Israelites found
          Babylonia and Chaldea to be a land of grievous oppression. They
          ridiculed them, and bade them sing them one of the songs of Zion. They
          required of them mirth when their hearts were heavy. On the festivals
          of their false gods they demanded that the worshippers of the Eternal
          One should help in their choirs, and tune their harps to heathenish
          minstrelsy. Even Daniel, in his high position under the Persian
          monarch, found that he was not without adversaries, who rested not
          till they had cast him into a den of lions. Those who were far away,
          whether in Babylonia or in Persia, found themselves the constant
          subjects of assault from the triumphant foe. They were crushed down,
          until they cried by reason of their oppression. It was not the first
          time that the people of God had been in the iron furnace. Did they not
          come forth from the house of bondage at the first, even from Egypt?
          Neither was Babylon the last place of trial for saints; for until the
          end of time the seed of the serpent will war with the seed of the
          woman. Is it not still true of us, as well as of our Saviour, |Out of
          Egypt have I called my Son|? Expect still to meet with opposition and
          oppression while you are passing to the land where the seed shall
          possess the heritage. Those of us who bear public testimony may have
          to bear the brunt of the battle, and suffer much from angry tongues.
          Nevertheless, to us it shall be an evident token of the Lord's favour,
          inasmuch as he counts us worthy to suffer for his name's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          But enough of that. I am making a very long story about the grievous
          routes through which we wend our way to the Celestial City. We climb
          on hands and knees up the Hill Difficulty; we tremblingly descend the
          steep of Humiliation. We feel our way through the tremendous pass of
          the Shadow of Death, and hasten through Vanity Fair, and walk warily
          across the Enchanted Ground. Not much of the way could one fall in
          love with. Perhaps the only part of it is that Valley of Humiliation,
          where the shepherd boy sat down and sang his ditty among the wild
          flowers and the lambs. One might wish to be always there; but fierce
          adversaries invade even these tranquil meadows, for hard-by where the
          shepherd sang his happy pastoral Christian met Apollyon, and had to
          struggle hard for his life. Do you not remember the spot where
        </p>
        <p>|The man so bravely played the man,</p>
        <p>He made the fiend to fly|?</p>
        <p>
          You see where God's people may be, and yet may be none the less, but
          all the more, under the divine protection. Are you in difficult
          places? Be not dismayed, for this way runs the road to glory. Sigh not
          for the dove's wing to hurry to your rest, but take the appointed
          path: the footsteps of your Lord are there.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So, now, I hasten at once into the sweet part of the subject,
          which consists of this: WHAT GOD WILL BE TO HIS PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET
          INTO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. |Yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary
          in the countries where they shall come.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, the great sanctuary stood on Mount Sion, |beautiful for
          situation, the joy of the whole earth.| That glorious place which
          Solomon had builded was the shrine to which the Hebrew turned his eye:
          he prayed with his window open toward Jerusalem. Alas! when the tribes
          were carried away captive, they could not carry the holy and beautiful
          house with them, neither could they set up its like within the brazen
          gates of the haughty city. |Now,| says the Lord God in infinite
          condescension, |I will be a travelling temple to them. I will be as a
          little sanctuary to each one of them. They shall carry my temple about
          with them. Wherever they are, I will be, as it were a holy place to
          them.| In using the word |little,| the gracious God would seem to say,
          |I will condescend to them, and I will be as they are. I will bow down
          to their littleness, and I will be to each little one of them a little
          sanctuary.| Even the temple which Solomon builded was not a fit
          habitation for the infinite Jehovah, and so the Lord will stoop a
          little further, and be unto his people, not as the sanctuary
          |exceedingly magnifical,| but as a little temple suitable for the most
          humble individual, rather than as a great temple in which vast
          multitudes could gather. |I will be to them as a little sanctuary| is
          a greatly condescending promise, implying an infinite stoop of love.
          There is a good deal more in my text than I shall be able to bring
          out, and I may seem, in making the attempt, to give you the same
          thought twice over. Please bear with me. Let me begin at the
          beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sanctuary was a place of refuge. You know how Joab fled to the horns
          of the altar to escape from Solomon's armed men: he ran to the temple
          hoping to find sanctuary there. In past ages, churches and abbeys and
          altars have been used as places of sanctuary to which men have fled
          when in danger of their lives. Take that sense, and couple it with the
          cities of refuge which were set up throughout all Israel, to which the
          man who killed another by misadventure might flee to hide himself from
          the manslayer. Now, beloved fellow-believer, wherever you are,
          wherever you dwell, God will be to you a constant place of refuge. You
          shall flee from sin to God in Christ Jesus. You shall flee from an
          accusing conscience to his pardoning love. You shall flee from daily
          cares to him who careth for you. You shall flee from the accusations
          of Satan to the advocacy of Jesus. You shall flee even from yourselves
          to your Lord, and he will be to you in all senses a place of refuge.
          This is the happy harbour of all saints in all weathers. Hither come
          all weather-beaten barques, and cast anchor in placid waters.
        </p>
        <p>|God is our refuge, tried and proved,</p>
        <p>Amid a stormy world:</p>
        <p>We will not fear though earth be moved,</p>
        <p>And hills in ocean hurled,|</p>
        <p>
          O my hearer, make the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High,
          thy habitation, and then shalt thou know the truth of this text: |God
          is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.| Wherever
          thou art cast, God will be to thee a suitable refuge, a little haven
          for thy little boat: not little in the sense that he cannot well
          protect thee; not little in the sense that his word is a small truth,
          or a small comfort, or a small protection, but little in this respect
          -- that it shall be near thee, accessible to thee, adapted to thee. It
          is as though the refuge were portable in all our wanderings, a
          protection to be carried and kept in hand in all weathers. Thou shalt
          carry it about with thee wherever thou art, this |little sanctuary.|
          Thy God, and thy thoughts of thy God, and thy faith in thy God, shall
          be to thee a daily, perpetual, available, present refuge. Oh, it is a
          delightful thought to my mind, that from every danger and every storm
          God will be to us an immediate refuge, which we carry about with us,
          so that we abide under the shadow of the Almighty!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, a sanctuary signifies also a place of worship. It is a place
          where the divine presence is peculiarly manifested -- a holy place. It
          usually means a place where God dwells, a place where God has promised
          to meet with his people, a place of acceptance where prayers, and
          praises, and offerings come up with acceptance on his altar. Now,
          notice, God says to his people, when they are far away from the temple
          and Jerusalem, |I will be to them as a little sanctuary.| Not, |I have
          loved the people, and I will build them a synagogue, or I will lead
          others to build for them a meeting-place; but I myself will be to them
          as a little sanctuary.| The Lord Jesus Christ himself is the true
          place of worship for saved souls. |There is no chapel in the place
          where I live,| says one. I am sorry to hear it, but chapels are not
          absolutely essential to worship, surely. Another cries, |There is no
          place of public worship of any sort where the gospel is fully and
          faithfully preached.| This is a great want, certainly, but still, do
          not say, |I am far away from a place of worship.| That is a mistake.
          No godly man is far away from a holy place. What is a place of
          worship? I hope that our bed-chambers are constantly places of
          worship. Place of worship? Why, it is one's garden where he walks and
          meditates. A place of worship? It is the field, the barn, the street,
          when one has the heart to pray. God will meet us by a well, a stone, a
          bush, a brook, a tree. He has great range of trysting-places when
          men's hearts are right.
        </p>
        <p>|Where'er we seek him he is found,</p>
        <p>And every place is hallowed ground.|</p>
        <p>
          When a man lives near to God, and abides in him, he should shake off
          the folly of superstition, and talk no more of holy places. God
          himself, his own presence makes a place of worship. Do you not catch
          the fulness of the thought? Yonder is Jacob. He lies down to sleep in
          a desert place with a stone for his pillow. No bishop had ever been
          upon the spot to consecrate it, no service had been held in the place
          by way of dedication, and yet when he awoke in the morning, he said,
          |How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God,
          and this is the gate of heaven.| God had been to his servant a little
          sanctuary in that instance, as he has been oftentimes since. Whenever
          you go to sea, God in your cabin shall be to you a little sanctuary.
          When you travel by railway, the carriage shall, through the Lord's
          presence, be a little sanctuary. God's presence, seen in a bit of
          moss, made in the desert for Mungo Park a little sanctuary. How often
          have the streets of London been to some of us as the golden pavements
          of the New Jerusalem, for God has been there! The Lord himself is the
          temple of saints in heaven, and he is their temple on earth. When God
          draws near to us, we worship and rejoice. Whenever we are abroad, and
          cannot come to the visible sanctuary where multitudes worship, let us
          ask the Lord to be to us as |a little sanctuary.| Have not your hearts
          cried out as you have thought of this house when you have been far
          away -- |Ziona, Ziona, the place of our solemn assemblies, when shall
          we return to thee? O sacred spot, where we have worshipped God, and
          God has met with us, and made the place of his feet glorious, when
          shall we again behold thee|? I shall not contend with the feeling; but
          I would supplant it with this higher thought: the Lord himself is our
          dwelling-place, and our holy temple. Hath he not said, |I will be to
          them as a little sanctuary|?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, go a little farther. Our God is to us a place of stillness. What
          was the sanctuary of old? The sanctuary was the most holy place, the
          third court, the innermost of all within the veil. It was the stillest
          place that ever was on earth: a closet of absolute silence. You must
          not think of the tabernacle in the wilderness as being a huge
          building. It was a small affair, and the innermost room of all was of
          narrow dimensions. The Holy of Holies was great for holiness, but not
          for space. There was this peculiarity about it, that it was the shrine
          of unbroken quiet. Was ever a voice heard in it? Once in the year the
          high-priest went in, and filled it full of the smoke of incense as he
          waved his censor in the mystic presence; but otherwise it was a
          chamber in which there was no footfall of living thing, or voice of
          mortal man. Here was the home of absolute quiet and silence. The
          stillness within the Holy of Holies of the temple must have reached
          the intensity of awe. What repose one might enjoy who could dwell in
          the secret place of the Most High! How one sighs for stillness! We
          cannot get it to the full anywhere in this country: even to the
          loneliest hill-top the scream of the railway-engine rises to the ear.
          Utter and entire stillness, one of the richest joys on this side
          heaven, one cannot readily obtain. Those who live in the wear and tear
          of this city life -- and it is an awful wear and tear -- might well
          pay down untold gold to be still for a while. What would we not give
          for quiet, absolute quiet, when everything should be still, and the
          whirring wheels of care should cease to revolve for at least a little
          while?
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes propose to myself to wait upon God and be still. Alas!
          There is the bell! Who is this? Somebody that will chatter for a
          quarter of an hour about nothing! Well, that intruder has gone; let us
          pray. We are on our knees. What is this? A telegram! One is half
          frightened at the very sight of it: it is opened, and it calls you
          away to matters which are the reverse of quieting. Where is stillness
          to be had? The only prescription I can give is this promise: |I will
          be to them as a little sanctuary.| If you can get with God, you will
          then escape from men, even though you have to live among them. If you
          can baptize your spirit into the great deeps of Godhead, if you can
          take a plunge into the fathomless love of the covenant, if you can
          rise to commune with God, and speak with him as a man speaketh with
          his friend, then will he be unto you as a little sanctuary, and you
          shall enjoy that solemn silence of the soul which hath music in it
          like the eternal harmonies. The presence of the Lord will be as a calm
          hand for that fevered brow, and a pillow for that burdened head. Use
          your God in this way, for so he presents himself to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sanctuary was a place of mercy. When the high-priest entered
          within the veil, he passed into the throne-room of mercy. The blood
          had been sprinkled there, and man might draw near to the God of mercy.
          A light was shining -- a light of love and mercy, between the wings of
          the cherubim. Those angelic forms were ministers of mercy, attendants
          upon the Lord of grace. Before the high-priest stood the mercy-seat.
          That was the name of the cover of the sacred ark of the covenant. On
          that mercy-seat there was the shechinah, which symbolized the presence
          of a merciful God. Of that mercy-seat the Lord had said, |There will I
          meet with you.| The holy place was a house of mercy. God was not there
          in power to destroy, nor in subtle wisdom to discover folly: he was
          there in mercy, waiting to forgive. Now, dear friends, God says, |I
          will be to them as a little sanctuary,| that is to say, an accessible
          throne of mercy, an accessible place of mercy. When men have no mercy
          on you, go to God. When you have no mercy on yourself -- and sometimes
          you have not -- run away to God. Draw near to him, and he will be to
          you as a little sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sanctuary was the house of mercy, and hence, a place of
          condescension -- |a little sanctuary.| Brethren, to suit our needs the
          blessings of grace must be given in little forms. What are we great in
          at all except in sin? We hear of |great men.| O friends, a great man!
          Does not the term make you laugh? Did you ever hear of a great ant, or
          a great emmet, or a great nothing? And that is all that the greatest
          of us can ever be. Our degrees and ranks are only shades of
          littleness; that is all. When the Lord communes with the greatest of
          men, he must become little to speak with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot convey to you quite what I see to be the meaning of this
          little sanctuary, laying the stress upon the adjective |little.| If
          you are talking of anything that is very dear, the tendency is always
          to call it |little.| The affectionate terms of language are frequently
          diminutives. One never says, |My dear great wife,| but we are apt to
          say, |My dear little wife.| We speak thus of things which are not
          |little| really, but we use the word as a term of affection. To speak
          very simply, there is a cosiness about a little thing which we miss in
          that which is on a large scale. We say, |Well, I did so enjoy that
          little prayer-meeting; but when it grew so much in numbers I seemed
          lost in it.| It is to me so marvellous that I hardly dare to say what
          I mean; but when the Lord brings himself down to our capacity he is
          greatly dear to us, and he would have us feel at home with him,
          comfortable with him. When he becomes to us |as a little sanctuary,|
          and we are able to compass his mercy to ourselves, and perceive its
          adaptation to our little trials and little difficulties, then we feel
          ourselves at home with him, and he is most dear to us. O thou blessed
          God, thou art so great, that thou must, as it were, belittle thyself
          to manifest thyself to me; how I love and adore thee that thou wilt
          deign to do this! Glory be to thy great name, though the heaven of
          heavens cannot contain thee, yet thou dwellest in the temple of my
          poor heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren, the sanctuary was only a little place. But then, if it
          had been ever so great -- if it had been as spacious as this whole
          island, and had been shut in to be the house of God -- would it have
          been a house fitted to contain the infinite God? If you take the arch
          of heaven as a roof, and floor it with the sea, or if you soar into
          still more boundless space, is that a house fit for him who filleth
          all immensity? When Jehovah makes himself little enough to be in the
          least comprehended by us, the descent is immeasurable. It is nothing
          more to him to come down to count the hairs of our head than to bow in
          the infinity of his mercy to take an interest in our littlenesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go a stage further. That sanctuary, of which we read in the Old
          Testament, was not only a place of great stillness, great mercy, and
          great condescension but it was a place of great holiness. |Holiness
          becometh thy house.| This applied to the whole temple, but the inner
          shrine was called |sanctum sanctorum| -- the Holy of Holies, for so
          the Hebrews make a superlative. It was the holiest place that could
          be. The world is an unholy place, and at times it is most grievously
          so. You mix up with people who defile you; how can you help it? Your
          daily business calls you to see and hear many things which are
          defiling. When these things are more than ordinarily glaring, you say
          to yourself, |Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness, that I might
          get away from the very sight of men!| I was with a mountain-climbing
          friend some time ago, and being thirsty, I drank some water from a
          fountain by the roadside. when I held the cup to my companion, he
          refused it, saying, |I don't drink that.| I said, |Why don't you drink
          it?| He answered, |I wait till I have climbed up into the mountains,
          where mortal men never pollute the streams, and then I drink. I like
          drinking of fountains at which none but birds sip: where the stream
          pours forth from God's hand pure as crystal.| Alas! I cannot climb
          with my Alpine friend as to material things; but what a blessed thing
          it is to get right away from man, and drink of the river of God which
          is full of water, and know the joys of his own right hand, which are
          for evermore! What bliss to enter into the Holy of Holies! Now, you
          cannot do that by getting into a cell, or by shutting yourselves up in
          your room; but you can enter the most holy place by communion with
          God. Here is the promise; the text means this -- | I will be to them
          as a little sanctuary -- a little Holy of Holies. I will put them into
          myself as into the most holy place, and there will I hide them. In the
          secret of my tabernacle will I hide them. I will set them up upon a
          rock.| Away from the unholiness of your own hearts, and the unholiness
          of those about you, get to your God, and hide yourselves in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we may regard the sanctuary as a place of cleansing. That may
          be gathered from the other rendering of my text. |I will be unto them
          a little sanctification.| God is the sanctification of his people he
          cleanses them from daily defilements, and is himself their
          righteousness. Those that come to God shall find in him sanctification
          for the daily acts of life, cleansing from ordinary as well as
          extraordinary transgression. We want not only the great blood-washing,
          but also the lesser washing of the feet with water; and the Lord
          himself will give us this blessing. Did not Jesus take a towel, and
          gird himself for this very purpose?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, God will be to us a place of communion and of revelation. In
          the Holy of Holies God spoke with man, on that one day in the year, in
          a wondrous manner; and he that had been there, and came forth alive,
          came out to bless the congregation. Every day of the year the teaching
          of the sanctuary was that in God there was everything his people
          wanted. In the holy place was the shechinah light, and |God is light,
          and in him is no darkness at all.| |The Lord is my light and my
          salvation.| In the holy place were the cherubim: God has legions of
          angels at his bidding, waiting to bless his people. In the holy place
          was the ark: God is to us the ark of the covenant. He has entered into
          covenant with men, towards us he has a throne of grace, and there he
          meets us, even in Christ Jesus, who is our propitiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within that ark there were three things: the rod of Aaron, that divine
          work of Christ which always buds; the pot of manna, the emblem and
          token of the living bread whereon his people feed; and the tablets of
          the law unbroken, in all their splendour, whereby the saints are
          justified. O brethren, if you want anything, if you want everything,
          go to God for it! He will be to you as a little sanctuary; that is to
          say, he will bring to you everything which was inside that holy place.
          Though but one piece of furniture, yet that ark of the covenant did
          really contain in itself, and round about it, all that the heirs of
          God can ever need while in this wilderness. Let this be a joy to you
          this day. Do not rely upon the creature. |All men are liars,| said
          David; and he was not far out. Broken cisterns abound on all sides;
          why waste your time on them? Get you straight away to your Creator,
          and find your all in him. If this day you are wrapped up in the things
          that are seen and temporal, may God deliver you therefrom, for all
          these things will melt as you hold them in your hand! The joys of this
          life are like the ice palace of Montreal, which is fair to look upon
          while the winter lasts, but it all dissolves as the spring comes on.
          All things round about us here are myths and dreams. This is the land
          of fancies and of shadows. Pray God to get you our of them, and that
          you may find in him your sanctuary, and indeed all that you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at this time you have lost many of the comforts of this life, and
          seem bereaved of friends, then find in God your |little sanctuary.| Go
          home to your chamber with holy faith and humble love, and take him to
          be your all in all, and he will be all in all to you. Pray after this
          fashion -- |O Lord, so work in me by thy Spirit that I may find thee
          in all things, and all things in thee!|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord has ways of weaning us from the visible and the tangible, and
          bringing us to live upon the invisible and the real, in order to
          prepare us for that next stage, that better life, that higher place,
          where we shall really deal with eternal things only. God blows out our
          candles, and makes us find our light in him, to prepare us for that
          place in which they need no candle, for the glory of God is their
          light; and where, strange to tell, they have no temple, for the Lord
          God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple thereof. The holy leads to
          the holiest: living upon God here leads to living with God hereafter.
          Oh, that God would gradually lift us up above all the outward, above
          all the visible, and bring as more and more into the inward and
          unseen! If you do not know anything about this, ask the Lord to teach
          you this riddle; and if you do know it, ask him to keep you to the
          life and walk of faith, and never may you be tempted to quit it for
          the way of sight and feeling. For Christ's sake we ask it. Amen.
