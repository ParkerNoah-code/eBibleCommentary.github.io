        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.24)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 20, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          |I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
          sake, and will not remember thy sins.| -- Isaiah 43:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE ARE SOME passages of sacred writ which have been more abundantly
          blessed to the conversion of souls than others. They may be called
          salvation texts. We may not be able to discover how it is, or why it
          is, but certainly it is the fact, that some chosen verses have been
          more used of God to bring men to the cross of Christ than any others
          in his Word. Certainly they are not more inspired, but I suppose they
          are more noticeable from their position, from their peculiar
          phraseology more adapted to catch the eye of the reader, and more
          suitable to a prevailing spiritual condition. All the stars in the
          heavens shine very brightly, but only a few attract the eye of the
          mariner, and direct his course; the reason is this, that those few
          stars from their peculiar grouping are more readily distinguished, and
          the eye easily fixes upon them. So I suppose it is with those passages
          of God's Word which especially attract attention, and direct the
          sinner to the cross of Christ. It so happens that this text is one of
          the chief of them. I have found it, in my experience, to be a most
          useful one; for out of the hundreds of persons who have come to me to
          narrate their conversion and experience, I have found a very large
          proportion who have traced the divine change which has been wrought in
          their hearts to the hearing of this precious declaration of sovereign
          mercy read, and the application of it with power to their souls: |I,
          even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake,
          and will not remember thy sins.| Hence I feel this morning somewhat
          pleased to have such a text, because I anticipate that my Master will
          give me souls; and I feel likewise somewhat afraid lest I should spoil
          the passage by my own imperfect handling thereof. I will, therefore,
          cast myself implicitly on the help of the Spirit, so that whatever I
          speak, may be suggested by him, and whatever he saith that may I
          speak, to the exclusion of my own thoughts as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall notice first, this morning, the recipients of mercy -- the
          persons of whom the Lord is here speaking; secondly, the deed of
          mercy, -- |I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions;|
          thirdly, the reason for mercy -- |for mine own sake;| and fourthly,
          the promise of mercy -- |I will not remember thy sins.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We are about to see who are THE RECIPIENTS OF MERCY; and I would
          have you all listen; peradventure there be some strayed in here who
          are the very chief of sinners -- some who have sinned against light
          and knowledge, who have gone the full length of their powers for sin,
          so that they come here self-condemned, and fearing that for them there
          is neither mercy nor pardon. I am about to talk to you of the
          lovingkindness of our glorious Jehovah, and may some of you be led to
          read your own condition in those characters which I shall describe to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you will turn to your Bibles, you will find who are the persons
          here spoken of. Look for example at the 22nd verse of the chapter from
          which our text is taken, and you will see, first, that they were
          prayerless people: |Thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob.| And are
          there not some prayerless ones sitting or standing here this morning?
          Might I not walk along these benches, and point my finger to one and
          another, and say, |Thou art not a praying one?| Or might I not reach
          out my hand to one and another upon this platform, and say, |Thou hast
          not been with God in secret, and held heart converse with him?| These
          prayerless ones may have repeated many a form of prayer, but the
          breathing desire, the living words, have not come from their lips.
          Thou hast lived, sinner, up to this time without sincere prayer, and
          if an ejaculation has bee forced from thy lips from a fear that took
          hold of thee; if a cry has gone forth from thee when in the sufferings
          of a sick bed, because the pains of death gat hold upon thee; if it
          has not been thy habit to pray, the impressions of that trying period
          have soon been forgotten. Is prayer your constant practice, my
          hearers? How many of you now before me, ay, and behind me too, must
          confess that you have not prayed, that it is not your habit to hold
          communion with God. Prayerless souls are Christless souls; for you can
          have no real fellowship with Christ, no communion with the Father,
          unless you approach his mercy-seat, and be often there; and yet if you
          are condemning yourselves, and lamenting that this has been your
          condition, you need not despair, for this mercy is for you: |Thou hast
          not called upon me, O Jacob;| yet, |I, even I, am he that blotteth out
          thy transgressions for mine own sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, these persons were despisers of religion, for observe the
          language of the same verse: -- |Thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.|
          And may I not say to some here -- thou despisest religion, thou hatest
          God; thou art weary of him, and lovest not his services. As for the
          Sabbath-day, do not too many of you find it the most tiresome day in
          the week, and do you not, in fact, look over your ledger on the
          Sabbath afternoon? If you were compelled to attend a place of worship
          twice on the Sabbath-day, would you not think it the greatest and most
          terrible hardship that could be inflicted upon you? You have to find
          some worldly amusement to make the hours of the Sabbath-day pass away
          with any comfort at all. So far from wishing that |congregations might
          ne'er break up.| and the Sabbath last for eternity, is it not to some
          of you the most tedious day of the week? You feel it to be a
          weariness, and are glad when it is gone. You do not understand the
          sentiment expressed by the poet:
        </p>
        <p>|Sweet is the work, my God, my King,</p>
        <p>To praise thy name, give thanks and sing.</p>
        <p>
          You know nothing of the pain of banishment from the courts of Zion,
          whither the sacred tribes repair; and when there you do not hold
          communion with God, rejoicing that the hallowed place has become a
          Bethel -- the house of God -- the very gate of heaven. You can never
          say --
        </p>
        <p>|My willing soul would stay</p>
        <p>In such a frame as this</p>
        <p>And sit and sing herself away</p>
        <p>To everlasting bliss.|</p>
        <p>
          Ah, no! not only is religion unlovely to you, but it is a weariness.
          But if you are now convinced of this sin, and are repenting of it, and
          desire to be delivered from its power, then God speaks to you this
          morning, and says, |I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
          transgressions for mine own sake -- return unto me, with unfeigned
          repentance, and I will have mercy upon you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, the character. They have been thankless persons: |Thou
          hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings.| They
          have been unthankful. They had their cattle and their flocks all
          multiplied and increased many fold, but they did not bring even one of
          the small cattle to him in return. Thou never gavest him a kid for a
          burnt offering, but hast been like the swine, regardless of the oak
          which strews food upon the ground for thee; thou hast been a carnal
          worldly character, receiving a gift, but never thanking the Almighty
          who caused it to be bestowed; while the little chicken, after it has
          drunk of the stream, lifteth its head, as if to thank God who provided
          the water. Thou hast been fed, day by day, by an Almighty power, and
          yet thou hast never given in return even one of the small cattle of
          thy flock for a burnt offering. This is true of some who attend our
          houses of prayer; they very rarely give to any collection for the
          cause of God; they are like the man in America, of whom some one has
          told us, who boasted that religion had been to him a very cheap thing,
          costing him only a few cents a year, of whom a good man said, |The
          Lord have mercy on your little stingy soul.| If a man has no more
          religion than that, if he has not a religion that will make him
          generous, he has no religion at all. I thought of that passage last
          Thursday night, while I was preaching: |Thou hast bought me no sweet
          cane with money.| God needeth nothing at your hands, but he likes
          little presents, he loves now and then to receive of your substance;
          for you know that little as it is in his eyes, comparatively speaking
          it is great, because it comes from a friend. But some of you have
          never bought him a sweet cane with your money -- never sang a hymn to
          his praise; you have attributed everything to your good luck, and have
          boasted that you have obtained everything you have got by the labour
          of your own hands, and that you can say, I have need to thank nobody
          for what I have. That has been thy spirit; thou hast given no thanks
          to God, -- the God of heaven and earth; thou hast not gloried him, but
          thyself, and yet the Most High is willing to pardon thy sin in this
          thing, if thou art but unfeignedly penitent, and dost sue for
          forgiveness, for he saith also to you, |I, even I, am he that blotteth
          out thy transgressions.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, again, these people were a useless people. |Neither hast thou
          filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast made me to
          serve with thy sins.| It is well said, the chief end of man is to
          glorify God. For that purpose God made the sun, moon, and stars, and
          all his works, that they might honor him. And yet how many are there,
          even, perhaps among my hearers this morning, who have never honored
          God in their lives. Ask yourselves what have you done? If you were to
          write your own history, it would be little better than that of
          Belzoni's toad, which existed in the rock for three thousand years;
          you may have lived like it, but you have done nothing. What souls have
          you ever won to the Saviour? How has his name been magnified by you?
          Have you ever served him? How have you ever worked for him? What have
          you done for God? Have you not been cumberers of the ground; taking
          the nourishment of the earth where some better tree might have grown,
          and bearing no fruit to the great husbandman, or at least, only a few
          sorry crabs, that were not worth his acceptance. For all you have
          done, the world might as well have never known you. You have not been
          even so much use as the glow-worm, which, at least, serves to light
          the steps of the traveller. The world may possibly be glad to get rid
          of some of you, and rejoice when you are gone. Perhaps you have
          assisted in destroying the souls of those with whom you have been
          connected in life. You can recollect the time when you led that young
          man first into the ale house. You can remember the hour when you swore
          a most horrible oath; your child was within hearing, and learned to be
          profane also. You may look upon some souls who are going even now to
          damnation through your example; and in hell you may see spirits
          starting up from their iron beds, and hear them shrieking in their
          woe: |Who is it that led me here, and caused my soul to be destroyed?
          -- thou art the author of my damnation.| Is the indictment true? Will
          you not be compelled to plead guilty to the charge? Do you not even
          now repent of your great transgressions? Even if it be so, my Master
          authorizes me to say again, |Thus saith the Lord, I, even I, am he
          that blotteth out my transgressions, and will not remember thy sins.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there are some who may be termed sanctuary sinnersþsinners in
          Zion -- and these are the worst of sinners. I can usually tell whether
          inquirers have been the children of pious parents or no, if after a
          confession of great guilt they feel unable to proceed at the
          remembrance of what they once were. Groaning, and sobbing, and tears
          running down their cheeks, are the silent language of their woe. When
          I see this, I always know that the language that succeeds will be: |I
          have been the child of pious parents; and I feel that I am one of the
          worst of sinners, because I was brought up to religion; and yet I
          disregarded it, and turned aside from it.| O yes, the worst of sinners
          are sinners in Zion, because they sin against light and knowledge;
          they force their way to hell, as John Bunyan says, over the Cross of
          Christ; and the worst way to hell is to go by the cross to it. Many of
          you now before me were consecrated to God by a beloved mother, and
          your father taught you to read and love the Scriptures of truth. You
          were brought up like Timothy; you well understand the theory of the
          way of salvation, and yet you come here, young men, some of you
          enemies to God and without Christ, and despisers of his word; some of
          you are even scoffers, or if not actually scoffers, you say religion
          is nought to you, and by your actions, if not by your words, declare
          it is nothing to you that Jesus should die. Ah! when I speak to you, I
          would not forget myself. Should it ever be my lot to wake up in hell,
          I should be amongst the most horribly damned there, for I had a most
          pious training, and should be forced to take my place with the
          sanctuary sinners. And you that are such, whom I am addressing now,
          are you not afraid? Ask yourselves now, |Who among us shall dwell with
          devouring fire?| Do you tremble and shake for fear, and with a
          penitent heart desire forgiveness? If so, then I say again, in my
          Master's name -- who spake nothing but love and mercy to penitent
          sinners, who said, |Neither do I condemn thee| -- Jehovah now declares
          |I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
          sake, and will not remember thy sins.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, once more, we have here men who had wearied God: |Thou hast made
          me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine
          iniquities.| You see the man who has been a professor of religion, and
          can look back twenty years ago, when he was a member of a Christian
          church; he was apparently walking in the fear of the Lord, and all men
          thought he had received the grace of God in truth; but he has turned
          aside into the paths of sin; sometimes his lips have been defiled with
          oaths, and his soul the bondslave of sin; but even now he is often
          found in God's house; sometimes he is affected to tears, and says
          within himself, |Surely I will return unto the Lord, for then was it
          better with me than now.| Self-condemned, he stands and weeps in the
          bitterness of his heart; and mark you, it may be this morning he has
          stepped into this vast assembly, and that his knees are knocking one
          against the other, yet it may be that his goodness shall prove like
          the morning cloud and the early dew, that passeth away; or it may be
          that the turning point is now come; |Now or never,| as Baxter used to
          say; now God or Satan, now accepted or condemned. Poor backslider,
          return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon thee; he will blot
          out all thy sins, and so blot them out that he will not remember them
          against thee any more for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          These, then, are the characters who receive mercy. Some of you may
          say, |You seem to think us a bad lot| -- and so I do. Others exclaim,
          |How can you talk to us in this way? We are a honest, moral, and
          upright people.| If so, then I have no gospel to preach to you. You
          may go elsewhere if you will, for you may get moral sermons in scores
          of chapels if you want them; but I am come in my Master's name to
          preach to sinners, and so I will not say a word to you Pharisees
          except this -- By so much as you think yourself righteous and holy, by
          so much shall ye be cast out of God's presence at last. Your sentence
          will be eternal banishment from the presence of him who hath said to
          every repenting sinner, |I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
          transgressions, and will not remember thy sins.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second point is, THE DEED OF MERCY. We have found out the
          persons to whom God will give mercy; now what is mercy's deed? It is a
          deed of forgiveness, and in speaking of it, I shall speak first of its
          being a divine forgiveness -- |I, even I, am he.| Divine pardon is the
          only forgiveness possible; for no one can remit sin but God only, and
          it matters not whether a Roman Catholic Priest, or any other priest
          shall say in the name of God, |I absolve thee from thy
          transgressions,| it is abominable blasphemy. If a man has offended me
          I can forgive him, but if he has offended God I cannot forgive him.
          The only discharge possible is pardon by God; but then it is the only
          pardon necessary. Suppose I have so sinned that the king or the queen
          will not pardon me, that my brethren will not forgive me, and that I
          cannot pardon myself; if God absolves me, that is all the acquittal
          that will be necessary for my salvation. Perhaps I stand condemned by
          the law of my country: I am a murderer and must suffer on the
          scaffold; the queen refuses to pardon, and perhaps she does right in
          such a refusal; but I do not want her forgiveness in order to enter
          heaven; if God acquits me, that will be enough. Were I such a
          reprobate that all men hissed at me and wished me gone from existence,
          if I knew that they would never forgive my crime -- though I ought to
          desire my fellow- creatures' forgiveness -- it would not be necessary
          that I should have it to enter heaven. It God says, I forgive thee,
          that is enough. It is only God that can forgive satisfactorily;
          because no human pardon can ease the troubled conscience. The
          self-righteous Pharisee may be content to give himself into the hands
          of a priest to be rocked to sleep in the cradle of delusion, but the
          poor convinced sinner wants something more than the arrogant dictum of
          a priest -- ten thousand of them, with all their enchantments, he
          feels to be all in vain, unless Jehovah himself shall say, |I have
          blotted out thy sins for mine own sake.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it is surprising forgiveness; for the text speaks as if God
          himself were surprised that such sins should be remitted: |I,even, I;|
          it is so surprising that it is repeated in this way, lest any of us
          should doubt it. And it is amazing to the poor sinner when first
          awakened to his sin and danger. It seems to be too good too be true,
          and he |wonders to feel his own hardness depart,| the mercy offered is
          so overwhelming. It is said that Alexander, whenever he attacked a
          city, put a light before the gate of it; and if the inhabitants
          surrendered before the light was burnt out, he spared them; but if the
          light went out first, he put them all to death. But our Master is more
          merciful than this; for if he had manifested grace only while a small
          light would burn, where should we have been? There be some here
          seventy or eighty years of age, and God has mercy on you still; but
          there is a light you know which when once quenched, extinguishes all
          hope of pardon -- the light of life. See then, grey-headed man, thy
          candle is burnt almost to the socket -- it has but the snuff left.
          Seventy years thou hast been here living in sin, and yet mercy waits
          on thee; but thou shalt soon depart, and mark me, there is no hope for
          thee then. But surprising grace, mercy's message is still proclaiming
          --
        </p>
        <p>|For while the lamp holds out to burn,</p>
        <p>The vilest sinner may return.|</p>
        <p>
          Unutterable mercy! There is no sinner out of hell so black but that
          God can wash him white. There is not out of the pit one so guilty that
          God is not able and willing to forgive him; for he declares the
          wondrous fact -- |I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
          transgressions.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice once more, that it is a present forgiveness. It does not say I
          am he that will blot out thy transgressions, but that blotteth them
          out now. There are some who believe, or at least seem to imagine, that
          it is not possible to know whether our sins are forgiven in this life.
          We may have hope, it is thought, that at last there will be a balance
          to strike on our side. But this will not satisfy the poor soul who is
          really seeking pardon, and is anxious to find it; and God has
          therefore blessedly told us, that he blotteth out our sin now; that he
          will do it at any moment the sinner believes. As soon as he trusts in
          his crucified God, all his sins are forgiven, whether past, present,
          or to come. Even supposing that he is yet to commit them, they are all
          pardoned. If I live eighty years after I receive pardon, doubtless I
          shall fall into many errors, but the one pardon will avail for them as
          well as for the past. Jesus Christ bore our punishment, and God will
          never require at my hands the fulfilment of that law which Christ has
          honored in my stead; for then would there be injustice in heaven: and
          that be far from God. It is no more possible for a pardoned man to be
          lost than for Christ to be lost, because Christ is the sinner's
          surety. Jehovah will never require my debt to be paid twice. Let none
          impute injustice to the God of the whole earth: let none suppose that
          he will twice exact the penalty of one sin. If you have been the chief
          of sinners, you may have the chief of sinner's forgiveness, and God
          can bestow it now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot help noticing the completeness of this forgiveness. Suppose
          you call on your creditor, and say to him, |I have nothing to pay
          with.| |Well,| says he, |I can issue a distress against you, and place
          you in prison and keep you there.| You still reply that you have
          nothing and he must do what he can. Suppose he should then say, |I
          will forgive all.| You now stand amazed and say, |Can it be possible
          that you will give me that great debt of a thousand pounds?| He
          replies, |Yes, I will.| |But how am I to know it?| There is a bond: he
          takes it and crosses it all out and hands it back to you, and says,
          |There is a full discharge, I have blotted it all out.| So does the
          Lord deal with penitents. He has a book in which all your debts are
          written; but with the blood of Christ he crosses out the handwriting
          of ordinances which is there written against you. The bond is
          destroyed, and he will not demand payment for it again. The devil will
          sometimes insinuate to the contrary, as he did to Martin Luther.
          |Bring me the catalogue of my sins,| said Luther; and he brought a
          scroll black and long. |Is that all?| said Luther. |No,| said the
          devil; and he brought yet another. |And now,| said the heroic saint of
          God, |write at the foot of the scroll: |The blood of Jesus Christ his
          Son cleanseth from all sin.| That is a full discharge.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, very briefly, the third thing -- THE REASON FOR MERCY. Says
          one poor sinner, |Why should God forgive me? I am sure there is no
          reason why he should, for I have never done anything to deserve his
          mercy.| Hear what God says, |I am not about to forgive you for your
          own sake, but for my own sake.| |But, Lord, I shall not be thankful
          enough.| |I am not about to pardon you because of your gratitude, but
          for my name's sake.| |But, Lord, if I am taken into thy church I can
          do very little for thy cause in future years, for I have spent my best
          days in the devil's service, surely the impure dregs of my life cannot
          be sweet to thee, O God.| |I will not engage to forgive you for your
          sake, but for my own. I do not want you,| says God, |I can do as well
          without you as with you, the cattle upon a thousand hills are mine;
          and if I pleased I could create a whole race of men for my service,
          who should be as renowned as the greatest monarchs, or the most
          eloquent preachers, but I can do as well without them, as with them;
          and I forgive you therefore for my own sake.| Is there not hope for a
          guilty sinner here? It cannot be pleaded by any one that his sins are
          too great to be pardoned, for the amount of guilt is hereby put
          entirely out of consideration, seeing that God forgives not on account
          of the sinner, but for his own sake. Did you never hear of a physician
          visiting a man upon a sick bed, when the poor man said, |I have
          nothing to give you for your attention to me.| |But,| says the doctor,
          |I did not ask for anything; I attend you from pure benevolence; and
          moreover to prove my skill. It will make no difference to me how long
          you live, I love to try my skill, and let the world know that I have
          power to heal diseases. I want to get myself a name.| And so God says,
          I desire to have a name for mercy; so that the worse you are, the more
          God is honored in your salvation. Go then to Christ, poor sinner --
          naked, filthy, poor, wretched, vile, lost, dead, come as thou art, for
          there is nothing required in thee, except the need of him:
        </p>
        <p>|This he gives you,</p>
        <p>'Tis his Spirit's rising beam.|</p>
        <p>|for mine own sake,| says God, |I will forgive.|</p>
        <p>
          IV. Now to conclude -- THE PROMISE OF MERCY. |And will not remember
          thy sins.| There are some things which even God cannot do. Though it
          is true he is Omnipotent, yet there are some things he cannot do. God
          cannot lie -- he cannot forsake his people -- he cannot disown his
          covenant; and this is one of the things it might be thought he could
          not do -- that is, forget. Is it impossible for God to forget? We
          finite creatures suffer many things to slip, but can the Almighty ever
          do so? That God who counteth the stars and calleth them all by their
          names -- who knoweth how many animalculae there are in the mighty
          ocean -- who notices every grain of dust that floats in the summer
          air, and is acquainted with every leaf of the forest, can he cease to
          remember? Perhaps we may answer |No.| Not as to the absolute fact of
          the committal of the deed; but there are senses in which the
          expression is entirely accurate. In what sense are we to understand
          God's forgetfulness of our sins?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, he will not exact punishment for them when we come
          before his judgment bar at last. The Christian will have many
          accusers. The devil will come and say |That man is a great sinner.| |I
          don't remember it,| says God. |That man rebelled against thee, and
          cursed thee,| says the accuser. |I do not remember it,| says God, |for
          I have said I will not remember his sins.| Conscience says, |Ah! but
          Lord, it is true, I did sin against thee, and that most grievously.|
          |I do not remember it,| says God -- |I said, I will not remember his
          sins.| Let all the demons of the pit clamour in God's ear, and let
          them vehemently shout out a list of our sins, we may stand boldly
          forth at that great day, and sing, |Who shall lay anything to the
          charge of God's elect?| for God does not even remember their sin. The
          Judge does not remember it, and who then shall punish? Unrighteous as
          we were; wicked as we have been; yet he has forgotten it all. Who then
          can bring to remembrance what God has forgotten? He says, |I will cast
          thy sins into the depths of the sea,| not into the shallows where they
          might be fished up again, but into the depths of the sea, where Satan
          himself cannot find them. There are no such things as sins recorded
          against God's people. Christ has so taken them away, that sin becomes
          a nonentity to Christians -- it is all gone, and through Jesu's blood
          they are clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second meaning of this is, I will not remember thy sins to suspect
          thee. There is a father, and he has a wayward son who went away that
          he might live a life of looseness and profligacy; but after a while he
          comes home again in a state of penitence. The father says, |I will
          forgive thee.| But he says next day to his younger son, |There is
          business to be done at a distant town to-morrow, and here is the money
          for you to do it with.| He does not trust the returned prodigal with
          it. |I have trusted him before with money,| says the father to
          himself, |and he robbed me, and it makes me afraid to trust him
          again.| But our heavenly Father says, |I will not remember thy sins.|
          He not only forgives the past, but trusts his people with precious
          talents. He never suspects them. He has never one suspicious thought.
          He loves them just as much as if they had never gone astray. He will
          employ them to preach his gospel; he will put them into the
          Sunday-school, and make them servants of his Son: for he says, |I will
          not remember thy sins.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: he will not remember in his distribution of the recompense of
          the reward. The earthly parent will kindly pass over the faults of the
          prodigal; but you know when that father comes to die, and is about to
          make his will, the lawyer sitting by his side, he says, |I shall give
          so much to William, who always behaved well, and my other son shall
          have so-and-so, and my daughter, she shall have so much; but there is
          that prodigal, I have spent a large sum upon him when he was young,
          but he wasted what he received, and though I have taken him again into
          favour, and for the present he is going on well; still I think I must
          make a little difference between him and the others. I think it would
          not be fair -- though I have forgiven him -- to treat him precisely as
          the rest;| and so the lawyer puts him down for a few hundred pounds,
          while the others, perhaps, get their thousands. But God will not
          remember your sins like that; he gives all an inheritance. He will
          give heaven to the chief of sinners as well as to the chief of saints.
          When he divides the portion to his children, it may be he will put
          Mary Magdalene as high as he does Peter, and the thief as high as he
          does John; yea, the malefactor who died on the cross is as much in the
          sight of God as the most moral person that ever lived. Here is a
          blessed forgetfulness. What sayest thou, poor sinner? Is thy heart
          drawn by a mysterious inspiration to the foot of the cross? Then I
          thank my Master; for I trust the one object of my life is to win souls
          for Christ, and if I may be blessed in that, my life shall be happy.
          Still do you say, |My sins are too great to be forgiven.| Nay, but O
          man, as high as the heaven is above the earth, so great is his mercy
          above thy sins, and so far does his grace exceed thy thoughts. Oh, but
          sayest thou, |He will not accept me.| What then is the meaning of this
          text -- |He is able to save unto the uttermost;| or this -- |Whosoever
          cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out;| and again -- |Whosoever
          will, let him come and take of the water of life freely.| Do you still
          say, |This does not include me.| Oh be not so faithless, but rather
          believe. Oh! had I the power, God knows I would weep myself away in
          order to win your souls.
        </p>
        <p>|But feeble our compassion proves,</p>
        <p>And can but weep where most it loves.</p>
        <p>
          I can do nothing but preach God's gospel; but since the moment Christ
          forgave me, I cannot help speaking of his love. I turned away from his
          gospel, and would have none of his reproofs. I cared not for his voice
          or his Word. That blessed Bible lay unread; these knees refused to
          bend in prayer, and my eyes looked on vanity. Has he not pardoned? Has
          he not forgiven? Yes. Then sooner may this tongue cleave to the roof
          of my mouth, than cease to proclaim free-grace in all its mighty
          displays of electing, redeeming, pardoning, and saving mercy. Oh! how
          loud ought I to sing, seeing I am out of hell, and delivered from
          condemnation. And if I am out of hell, why should not you be? Why
          should I be saved and not another? It was for sinners, remember, that
          Jesus came. Mary Magdalene, Saul of Tarsus -- the very chief of
          sinners, were accepted, and why do you foolishly conclude that you are
          cast out? Oh, poor penitent if you perish, you will be the FIRST
          penitent who ever did so. God give you his blessing, my dear friends,
          for Christ's sake. Amen.
