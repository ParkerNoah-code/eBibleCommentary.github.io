        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.297-98)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, February 5th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          |Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
          waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?| -- 2 Kings
          5:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          PROUD SELF and EVIL QUESTIONING are two of Satan's firmest allies, and
          two of the chief destroyers of the souls of men. Both of these
          adversaries attacked Naaman at once. Proud Self fell upon him and gave
          him the first blow, and Naaman cried, Behold, I thought, He will
          surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his
          God, and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper.| When
          Proud Self had given his blow, on came his friend and helper, Evil
          Questioning, and he smote Naaman, and then Naaman said, |Are not Abana
          and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
          may I not wash in them, and be clean?| Ah! it is a hard case with a
          man who has to fight with two such imps as these -- his own proud
          spirit, and that equally wicked spirit of unbelief -- asking questions
          -- evil questions -- and tempting the Lord our God. Against the first,
          namely, our proud and righteous self, God has opened all his
          batteries. The ten commands are like ten great pieces of ordnance,
          every one of them pointed against our own pride and self
          righteousness. The Bible is an opponent, even unto death, of
          everything like boasting, or encouraging the hope of salvation by any
          efforts of our own. Righteous Self is doomed to be rent in pieces, and
          his house to be made a dunghill; God hates him because he is an
          anti-Christ, and sets himself in opposition to the plenteous atonement
          of the Lord Jesus Christ. As for Evil Questioning, he also doth much
          ruin among the souls of men. And as it has been my hap of late to meet
          him very often, I propose this morning to track him to his den, to
          bring him out to light, and by God's help, if his Spirit shall be here
          present, to fully defeat him, once for all, to the rescue of many of
          you. Oh what multitudes of souls have gone to hell asking questions.
          Not asking, |What must I do to be saved?| but asking questions about
          matters too high for them; asking, in fact, questions which were only
          meant to be some excuse for continuing in their sins, pillows for
          their wicked heads to lean upon; putting queries to ministers, and
          propounding hard and knotty points that from the ignorance of man they
          might draw reasons why they should continue in their evil way, should
          hold on in their wicked course, and so should resist the mercy of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just listen to what Evil Questioning said to Naaman, and what Naaman
          said as the result of it. If I understand my text aright, it means
          just this: |What virtue can there be in water? Why should I be told to
          go and wash at all? I have washed many times and it never cured my
          leprosy. This dry disease is not so readily got rid of; but supposing
          there is some medical influence in water, why must I wash in Jordan?
          It is but a mere ditch, why can I not go and wash in some of my own
          rivers? We have medicinal streams in our own land. At any rate, Abana
          and Pharpar are cleaner and wider, and their current is stronger than
          that of the Jordan, which empties itself into the Dead Sea. And to my
          mind,| he says |it seems to be but a dead river at the very best. May
          I not go home to Samaria and there wash? A pretty thing that I should
          come all this way from Samaria to see and then all he should tell me
          should be, wash and be clean. It is absurd,| he says, |it is contrary
          to the nature of things; it cannot be possible, and therefore,| he
          save, |I will not go and try it.| This, you see, was Evil Questioning.
          What business was it of Naaman's whether there was any medicinal
          powers in the water or not? What concern was it to him whether Abana
          or Pharpar were better or worse than Jordan? he need have nothing to
          do but with the simple command -- |Go, wash in Jordan seven times, and
          thou shalt be clean.| Twas his to obey, not to question. Twas his to
          fulfill the command, not to enquire into its philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what Evil Questioning said to Naaman, that he has said to many of
          you, my hearers. I know there are some of you who are even to-day
          harbouring this arch-traitor. I pray that God by his grace may find
          him out this morning, that we may turn him out of your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall try, first of all, to detect this old Mr. Evil Questioning.
          When he have found him out, I shall try to describe him to you so that
          you may know him again the next time you meet him. Then when we have
          described him, we will bring him out, and by God's help we will
          execute him; and when we have done that, I shall propose to you that
          we kill all his children, for they are a very large family. If we may
          believe John Bunyan, there are some nine or ten of them, and all of
          them the picture of their old father. I hope we shall have grace to
          put an end to them as well as the parent.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, let us DETECT OLD MR. EVIL QUESTIONING.</p>
        <p>
          He does not go by that name in the world. When he was brought up to be
          tried as a traitor, he had the impudence to tell the Judge that his
          name was not Evil Questioning at all. |My Lord,| he said, |my proper
          name is Honest Enquiry, not Evil Questioning. There may be a man of
          the name of Evil Questioning, but I am not that person at all, and I
          hope it will never become a sin for a man to make an honest enquiry,
          and freely to ask the ground of any truth that is propounded to him.
          For, my Lord, if we are to take things upon mere credence, matters of
          faith upon the witness of men, indeed we shall soon make great fools
          of ourselves. My name is Honest Enquiry,' my Lord, and I think myself
          to be a very honest citizen.| Since Evil Questioning goes by that
          name, then, and you will not, therefore, readily detect him, I must
          take you round to see if we can find him out by his speech, for it is
          not by his name, but by his prating, that you may know this fellow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Lord Will-be-will, according to John Bunyan, in his allegory of
          the Holy War, kept an officer called Mr. Diligence, who used to go
          about listening under people's windows, catching every word he heard,
          and then he would bring to his Lord, intelligence if any traitor were
          harboured within the gates. Let me play the part of Mr. Diligence, and
          we will listen a moment or two while we hear old Mr. Evil Questioning
          talk. He is a ready fellow; he can talk upon almost any subject; I
          heard him the other day preach a sermon upon doctrine. He had been
          hearing a Calvinist minister. This minister had preached the truth as
          it is in Jesus and he had earnestly exhorted him to lay hold on Christ
          Jesus, but Mr. Evil Questioning put it thus -- |Now, if there are so
          many to be saved, and there are a certain number of people that are
          not to be saved, then it can make no difference to me, I had better
          leave it as it is; for if I am to be saved I shall be saved, and if I
          am not to be saved I shall not be saved. Besides,| said he, |it is
          irresistible grace that saves men. Now, if God sends that grace into
          my heart, then I shall be saved, and if he does not, why I cannot do
          anything, and therefore I may as leave sit still as try and do
          anything you know, I hear the minister say that faith and repentance
          are the gift of God; well, if they are the gift of God, how
          inconsistent he was to exhort me to believe and repent. The man does
          not understand logic. I shall not believe, I shall not repent. For, do
          you not see that it does not stand to reason that I should try to do
          either the one or the other, because they are both the gift of God.|
          Thus the man satisfied himself, and while I heard him talking, I
          thought to myself, |I know you Mr. Evil Questioning, well, and I know
          your father too; you are a descendant of the old fellow that was
          hanged in Bad Street, in old Bunyan's time, and I only wish I had the
          hanging of you again.| He went another day to hear an Arminian
          preacher. He heard this preacher talking about the universal love, and
          the universal mercy of God; and this minister exhorted him to lay hold
          on Christ. But Mr. Evil Questioning is like a spider, he can suck gall
          out of any flower; so he went home and he said -- |Well, if God is co
          infinitely merciful, then my sins are very little things indeed. I
          need make all this fuss and bother about them. I will just go on in
          them, and no doubt God will not he hard with me at the last, but will
          just forgive those sins off-hand, whether I believe or not. And,
          besides,| said he, |his mercy is so lasting, that when I come to die I
          will just say, Lord, have mercy upon me,' and then I shall enter into
          the kingdom of heaven as well as the best of them. And what is the use
          of that man exhorting me to believe and to repent, for he told me I
          might fall from grace? I might as well not begin, as begin now,
          presently to leave off, so I will wait till the end of my life before
          I begin, and then I shall run the less risk of falling from grace
          afterwards.| Thus he reasoned with himself. Now whenever you hear that
          kind of argument, you may know at once there is a traitor there. You
          have discovered him. That is old Mr. Evil Questioning. Do not lose a
          moment, run straight up to your chamber, and tell the Lord that you
          have found out a traitor; ask him to send at once a warrant after him,
          to arrest the fellow who is doing the utmost he can to destroy your
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes this gentleman does not preach a doctrinal sermon but it is
          a practical one. I heard him the other day declaiming thus: |I do not
          go to any place of worship now-a-day; for to tell the truth, there is
          such a variety of sects and parties, and one kind of Christians finds
          fault with another kind, that they are not agreed among themselves, I
          do not mean to go and listen to them or to pay any attention to them
          while they are so divided and so bigoted. Besides,| he said, |look at
          the Christians, they are no better than other people, I dare say;
          their best ministers, if we could catch them in a corner are not at
          all superior to the rest of mankind, and as to common professors, why
          I lost ten pounds the other day by one of them who is a deacon. They
          are not a whit superior to the rest of mankind, I am sure; therefore,
          I shall not think about religion at all, it is all a farce and a lie.
          Why should I consider it? I will have nothing to do with it.| There is
          the traitor again. At other times this man will find out some poor,
          lean, half-starved Christian, who has but little grace and very great
          misery, and he begins to talk thus. |There are your Christians, see
          what moping folks they are! How miserable! I never saw such a set of
          people in my life. Why if I were to go and listen to their minister I
          should drown myself in a month; they are such miserable wretches. As
          for me, I say let us hope well and have well; let us live merrily
          while we may, and if we must ever think about these serious things,
          let us put it off to the last.| Have you never heard that gentleman?
          Ah, my hearers, there are some of you that have got him in your
          hearts, and I am only describing what you have often said to
          yourselves; or if I have not as yet hit upon the precise discourse of
          old Mr. Evil Questioning, yet I think I have tracked out some of his
          haunts. Does he not often give a tap at your door, and you say, |Walk
          in friend Questioning, I have a little matter to talk over with you.
          The minister has given me a little trouble in my conscience; come and
          see if you cannot put a plaster over the wound, so that I may go on in
          my sins comfortably, and be relieved from the troublesome necessity of
          changing my life and becoming a Christian.| Sometimes this old fellow
          Evil Questioning goes further and tries, as he says, to lay the axe at
          the root of the thing. |Why,| he says, |this doctrine of the
          atonement, this salvation by the blood of Christ, I have only just
          this to say about it, that a rational man cannot believe it at all. It
          is positively ridiculous to think of a man being saved by the
          righteousness of somebody else, let the Methodist believe it, I shall
          not. There is no reason in it.| Then he begins to ask questions about
          the atonement, and proceeds to questions about the decrees, questions
          about inscrutable matters, questions about effectual calling, about
          total depravity, and the like, and so he runs through the whole scale
          of gospel truths and Bible revelations, stopping at each one and
          asking a question that he may find in each some apology for disobeying
          God, some excuse for not yielding up his whole heart to Christ, and
          now believing in him that died to save the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, however, I need not give you a more accurate description than
          I have done of this archdestroyer. In fact, it were utterly impossible
          for me to describe to you all his speeches. There is no subject which
          he will not handle. He is so glib of tongue and he has such sophistry
          of argument, that he will often persuade a man to believe that the
          worse is the better reason, and make a man imagine that he is not only
          excusable, but even commendable, for not being a Christian, and giving
          up his heart to Christ. Oh! if I could but see this Evil Questioning
          buried seven fathoms deep, I should feel I had an easy work to do in
          preaching the gospel; but, alas! when I have been the most earnest, my
          hearers have raised a question on the discourse, instead of yielding
          to its precepts; and when I have sought to explain the doctrine and
          lay it down by the rule of the Word, I find instead of producing
          conviction, that one and another will be questioning the orthodoxy or
          the heterodoxy of it. No fruit is brought forth because ye suffer not
          the seed to enter into your hearts, there to work effectually to the
          saving of your souls. Oh, fools and slow of heart, to be for ever
          asking questions while time is flying, and men are dying, and hell is
          filling -- to be questioning when there is but a step between you and
          death -- to be trying to unriddle mysteries and to unravel secrets
          when you are on the borders of the tomb and your souls may soon be
          required of you. Oh, fools, I say, and slow of heart, but surely so ye
          will be to the end of the chapter, unless sovereign grace shall open
          your eyes to see in the face of this Mr. Evil Questioning the marks
          and lineaments of a child of Satan, and unless God shall give you
          grace to turn him out of doors, to expel him instantly, find have no
          more to do with him as long as you live.
        </p>
        <p>
          But do you know while I was going my rounds this morning looking after
          Mr. Evil Questioning, I happened to stop at the door of a house that
          had the blood-mark over the lintel and I was very much surprised to
          hear a voice just like old Mr. Questioning's inside that house. I
          could not believe my own ears, but I saw my own name on the door, and
          so I thought I might venture to enter and lo, I found this old villain
          sitting at my own table, and what think you he was saying? Why he was
          talking like this, |God has promised that you shall hold on your way,
          but then you have so many temptations you cannot. He has promised to
          bless your ministry, but then the hearts of men are so hard, you might
          just as well give up preaching.| He began to question the promises and
          asked how they could be fulfilled, and was beginning to make me
          question the vitality of my own religion Get you gone, sir, I will
          have nothing to do with you, and if I meet you again I hope by the
          grace of God I shall be able to heave a stone that shall sink deep in
          your old crazy pate. Begone, sir, and have nought to do with me. With
          the child of God thou art a hated intruder. Who am I that I should
          question the Almighty? Who is the finite that he should ask the
          Infinite where is his power to fulfill his promise? No, my God:
        </p>
        <p>|I trust the all-creating voice,</p>
        <p>And faith requires no more,|</p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus detected Mr. Evil Questioning, we will go on to
          DESCRIBE HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Evil Questioning often boasts that he is the child of Human
          Reason; but I will let you know a secret or two about his parentage.
          Mr. Human Reason has once a very respectable man. He had a
          country-seat in the gardens of Paradise, and he was then great and
          honorable. He served his God with all his might and many a great and
          marvellous thing did he discover for the good of mankind; at that time
          he had a family, and they were all like himself, right good and loyal.
          But after the fall this man married again, and he took to himself one
          called Sin to be his partner, and this old Evil Questioning was one
          that was born after the fall. He does not belong to the first family
          at all. The first family was not so numerous as the last. There was
          one called Right Judgment born at that time. I hope he is still alive,
          and I believe he is. But the second family was very black and of
          tainted blood. They did not take at all after the father, except in
          one point, that at the time of the fall Mr. Human Reason lost his
          country-seat at Paradise, and together with the rest of the servants
          of Adam fell from his high estate and became perverted and depraved.
          His children are like him in their depravity, but not in their power
          of reasoning. They take after their mother, and they always have a
          predilection for sin, so that they |put darkness for light and light
          for darkness, bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.| The old
          gentleman never mentions his mother's name if he can help it. He
          always likes to boast that he is a lineal descendant of Human Reason,
          and so indeed he is, but he is a descendant of fallen Human Reason,
          not of Human Reason as it was in its glorious perfection. Now, all the
          powers of Adam were by the fall spoiled and ruined. They are there,
          but their bias was turned from that which is good to that which is
          evil, and now reason is not a trustworthy guide. Enlightened by the
          Spirit of God it can judge righteous judgment, but unenlightened and
          uninstructed, its bias is towards that which shall excuse man in his
          rebellion, which shall dishonor God, and which shall seek to raise the
          human race in proud rebellion against their Lord and Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand then, that the parentage of Evil Questioning lies here;
          man's perverted reason meets with man's love of sin, and these twain
          do join to bring forth these evil questions. It is not your reason
          that makes you talk against God, except it be your perverted reason.
          It is your love of sin that sets your reason on the wide-awake watch
          to try and discover some difficulty, and to make that a pretense why
          you should not be obedient to the heavenly command. Do not believe
          yourself when you repeat the tale told you by Satan, that you are only
          making honest enquiries -- do not believe it for a minute. The honest
          enquiry is content with |It is written,| and there it stops. Besides,
          if not content with this, the truth of the Bible is proved by the most
          conclusive logic. It is proved too by arguments against which all the
          gates of hell can never prevail. There are many excellent works which
          have been written, and all the arguments of modern sceptics have been
          refuted a thousand times over. Every objection that man can make has
          been already broken in pieces, and if a man be honest in his
          enquiries, he cannot long remain an unbeliever. Do not believe that
          your questioning springs from honesty, but be honest with yourself,
          and acknowledge this, that you do not love the gospel because it is
          too hard for you -- it wants you to give up sins that you love too
          much, to renounce them, and because of this, you begin to question its
          truth. If it did not come upon you so sorely, and deal with you so
          summarily, you would believe it. But because it will have you give up
          your sins, you go in quest of a doubt, and put in plea after plea to
          gain time and hold on with the world. Though you do not doubt the
          justice of the law, or the truth of the gospel, ye vexatiously
          question both. And yet you know very well that it is beyond your
          questioning, for it is the eternal verity of the Eternal God.

          I have thus described the old man's parentage; shall I now tell you
          where he had his education? After Mr. Evil Questioning was born, he
          was put to the school of that old schoolmaster who has taught a great
          many of you -- Mr. Worldly Wiseman, and this Mr. Worldly Wiseman used
          to make him read out of a book, called |Human Maxims,| and this man
          has learned all the logic-art of that book of Human Maxims -- a book
          very much patronized by the sacred consistory of hell. They greatly
          delight in it, and would have it spread everywhere; and they would
          have even the prophets of God bow their knee to this Baal, and take
          |for doctrines the commandments of men.| No wonder, therefore, that
          being bad at first, and essentially vicious, this education was just
          suited to develop his powers, and he has gone from bad to worse, till
          he has been known at times to question the very existence of a God,
          the immortality of the soul, the truth of the Bible, the divinity of
          Christ, in fact; he has questioned everything which can be dear to a
          true-hearted man, every truth which can sustain the soul in the midst
          of its troubles, and give it light in its seasons of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now to come nearer still to him. I have told you his parentage and
          education, now as to his character. If,. you notice this man, it is
          only his talking that will strike you, and you will observe this about
          his talk, that he speaks about things of religion in a very different
          style from what he thinks about things of the world. If you meet him
          and he is buying or selling, he talks very rationally indeed; but when
          he comes to make excuses for himself and tell you why he is not
          converted, he talks like a fool, as he is. He would not himself act in
          the world upon the theories that he adopts in religion. Did I not tell
          you that I heard him say once, that because God had decreed therefore
          he would do nothing? Now you would expect to find him if he were
          honest in what he said, going out into the world and folding his arms,
          and saying, |Now if I am to get rich I shall get rich, and so there is
          an end of it; and if I am not to get rich I shall not get rich, and
          therefore I shall not work.| No, he is as busy as a bee when he is
          about the things of the world, and yet he is as idle as possible when
          he is meddling with the things of Christ. This same man, if he has a
          field to sow, he knows very well that if God has ordained a harvest
          there will be a harvest -- but he sows for all that. He can understand
          in his business how free-agency is quite consistent with Divine
          Sovereignty. He understands when he is abroad how the decree of God
          does not at all limit the free action of man, but when he comes to
          matters of godliness with regard to his own soul, then he sees a
          wonderful difficulty there. Ah! he sees it because he wants to see it,
          and a man can see anything he likes to see if he does not want to do a
          thing that is uncomfortable and unpleasant. If you want an excuse for
          going to hell, you can find a thousand, every one as bad as the other,
          and Mr. Evil Questioning will furnish you with any quantity of them to
          suit every particular case. He has excuses that will suit the
          Frenchman and excuses that will suit the Englishman. He has a stock of
          common excuses just adapted to be sold retail to the poor, and he has
          many a refined excuse of every shade and color to suit the taste of
          the rich. No man like him. If you want to perish, you may do it
          logically. If you want to go to hell riding on a syllogism, he will
          assist you. He will give you the most rational and comfortable
          conveyance if you want to go there. Only to go to his shop, he will
          not keep you a single moment, but serve you across the counter with
          the most polite bow, and send you on your way rejoicing towards the
          depths of perdition.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will thus detect Mr. Evil Questioning, because he uses a logic in
          spiritual things that he would not use in temporal things. Here is
          another way by which you may discover him. This man, when he is
          talking about the Infinite God, always measures him by the finite rule
          of man. When God is in the question, who is not to be limited nor to
          be grasped by our comprehension, he deals as freely with the matter as
          if it were a mere thing of ells or inches, or of ounces and pounds.
          Omnipotence he forgets, and omniprescence, and omniscience, and
          eternity, -- all these attributes of God he casts away, and he talks
          to God, and talks about God, as if God were nothing different from the
          creature that his hands have made. Have you never heard him say, |How
          can such a thing be done?| If he did but stop and think, he would know
          that it is irrational to use the word can, when he is speaking of an
          Omnipotent One. He will often say, |Will such a thing that is promised
          be accomplished?| If he did but pause, he would recollect that to ask
          a question as to whether a thing will be done about a God who is true
          and faithful, is to put a wicked and blasphemous question. But still
          he will do it. He deals with God's promises as if they were the
          draft-notes of a rogue. He treats God's doctrines as if they were the
          utterance of a raving maniac. He will deal with substantial verities
          as if they were frothy dreams, the mere speculations of a deluded
          brain. Strange villain that he is, daring to lift his mouth against
          heaven, and spit his blasphemous questions against the very existence
          and power of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may know him again by another sign, for he always draws his
          arguments from exceptions. He meets a miserable Christian -- he knows
          very well that where there is one miserable Christian there are a
          thousand happy ones -- but then he puts these thousand happy ones
          behind. It is the one miserable one that he fixes his attention upon.
          If he meets with one fallen professor, he knows that there are ten
          thousand Christians that stand upright in the hour of temptation, and
          will not bend in the blast of the terrors of the world when they come
          against him, seeking to turn him from his upright course -- but no, he
          forgets all these; he only thinks of that one hypocrite, or that one
          professor, who was overtaken in an evil hour, and then he makes a
          syllogism like this -- |One Christian has proved to be a hypocrite,
          therefore, as it is a bad thing to be a hypocrite, I will not be a
          Christian.| Now, what an argument! And yet this satisfies some of you.
          There are some of you, when you have been once taken in by a man, will
          say, |Ah, well! I will never make a profession of religion. So-and-so
          made a profession; he was a bad one; therefore I will not have ought
          to do with it.| Where is the force of this argument? If there are bad
          Christians, that is a presumption in itself that there are good ones,
          for if ever you see a bad sovereign in circulation, you may be sure
          there are some good ones, for if they were all bad we would none of us
          take any of them. Be sure of it, then, the name of Christian would
          cease to be, unless there were some good ones to keep up the current
          coin -- the real stock in trade -- on which the world grows rich. And
          suppose they were all bad, is that any reason why you should not be
          true and honest? If the church were all hypocrites, at least let me be
          an honest man, and serve my God truly, and with all my heart. That is
          the proper way of reasoning. But Evil Questioning takes exceptions,
          and considers them as if they were rules, and then from the exceptions
          draws a deduction which would not be logical even if they were the
          rule, but which, seeing it is based upon the exceptions, is without a
          basis at all, and sinks to the ground as a mere wanton wilful
          falsehood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will only keep you one more minute upon this part of my subject. You
          may always know Mr. Evil Questioning by this one fact, that he
          invariably draws his conclusions from his wishes. When I have got an
          argument on hand, and the conclusion is contrary to what I would like
          it to be, I always think there is more likelihood that my reasoning is
          correct; but if the conclusion is just what my carnal heart would like
          it to be, I say I am afraid that my logic was at fault somewhere; for
          if I draw a conclusion that pleases myself, I ought to be very
          careful, especially when it is a matter in which my soul is concerned.
          We draw Justice with a bandage over her eyes, holding a pair of
          scales: now, whenever we are trying other people, that is how our
          justice ought to be meted out, and so it should be when we are trying
          ourselves. But, my dear friends, whenever we try ourselves, we are apt
          to move the bandage a little up, that the right eye may see just a
          little, that we may manage to put, somehow or other, a little extra
          weight in the scale that will favor ourselves. No man is so partial a
          judge as the man that is trying his own character. We are very severe
          with others, but we are very lenient to ourselves; we keep our swords
          well sharpened for our enemies; but if we do hit ourselves it is with
          the back of the blade; we never venture to strike deep and we always
          wish to have a little salve ready, some kind of extenuation.
          Habitually almost without knowing it we shake hands with ourselves
          very often, and say, |You are not so bad a fellow after all, I thought
          there was something amiss with you, and so there certainly is; but
          still there is not so much wrong with you as there is with a great
          many people, and you are a very respectable individual taking you for
          all in all.| Now, if that is the conclusion you come to, suspect it,
          there is a flaw in the logic somewhere. Just look the reasoning
          through again. Cast that sum up once more, if it comes to this result,
          |Thou art rich,| cast it up again, there is an extra figure that you
          have put in; for the right conclusion is, if you are an unconverted
          man, you are naked, and poor, and miserable. Do not believe the
          arithmetic or the logic which would bring you to any other conclusion
          than this.

          III. Having thus described this old enemy after whom I am in full
          pursuit; I pause awhile and go on to my third division, which is
          bringing him out TO EXECUTE HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must give you a bit from John Bunyan's Holy War, for it is so
          wonderfully suggestive, and so thoroughly worthy of its quaint author.
          Mr. Evil Questioning was detected harbouring four doubters, who had
          come to attack the town of Mansoul; when he was brought up, the
          indictment was that he had studied the ruin of the town of Mansoul,
          that he had feloniously and treacherously harboured four of the king's
          enemies, and that he had expressed in the hearing of one Mr.
          Diligence, his wish that there were ten thousand such doubters in
          Mansoul. The old fellow when he was brought before the bar, first
          denied his name, and said his real name was Mr. Honest Enquiry, but
          when it was proved that he was old Evil Questioning, for Lord
          Will-be-will in the time of his evil estate had known him very
          intimately, then the old fellow pleaded |Not Guilty,| and he began at
          once to utter his defense. |I answer,| said Evil Questioning |the men
          that came into my house were strangers, and I took them in, and is it
          now become a crime in Mansoul for a man to entertain strangers? That I
          also nourished them is true, and why should my charity be blamed? As
          for the reason why I wished ten thousand of them in Mansoul, I never
          told it to the witnesses nor to themselves. I might wish them to be
          taken, and so might wish well to the town of Mansoul. I also bid them
          take heed that they fell not into the Captain's hands, but that might
          be because I am unwilling that any man should be slain, and not
          because I would have the king's enemies escape.| So Mr. Evil
          Questioning was true to his name, he kept on questioning till the
          verdict was given, the sentence of death pronounced, and carried into
          execution; for they hanged him, as Bunyan says, opposite the door of
          his own house at the top of Bad Street, Ah! but I am afraid that he is
          alive now, still living and going about: I wish therefore to bring him
          up again to trial, and we will see if we cannot bring some charges
          against him; we will empanel an honest jury, and I know what the
          sentence will be, we shall lead him out to execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men and brethren, if you have been questioning, instead of believing,
          if you have been making enquiries, instead of saying, |What must I do
          to be saved?| which is the only allowable question, let me first beg
          of you to drive out this Evil Questioning, because he is a traitor to
          the King of heaven. He does not wish your good, but your ill; more
          than this, he is sent by Satan to prevent your obeying the commands of
          God: he is come to betray you. Oh I listen not to his words, though
          they are smoother than butter, for inwardly they are drawn swords: the
          drift of all he says is to keep you unreconciled to God. The great end
          of all he says is to make you wander further and further from the
          central point of bliss, to make you forsake the cross, to make you
          follow the devices of your own heart, and so bring upon yourself
          inevitable destruction. Oh! I beseech you, drive him out, because he
          is a traitor to the great King to whom all your allegiance is due. He
          wants to make you an enemy to God, and to keep you so. Out with him, I
          pray you. Hang him! let a straight end be put to him at once: let him
          no more delude and ruin your souls, and make you persevere in
          disobedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, again, I beseech you turn him out, for he is a liar. All the
          conclusion to which he has brought you are false ones, and you know
          they are. When you have sometimes in company bragged a little, and
          when a hard word has been said that has come home to your conscience,
          when you have put on a stout confidence and have begun to insinuate
          some doubts, you know very well you are not speaking honestly. You
          know there is a hell, though you often laugh at the idea; you know
          there is a world to come, though you argue against it. You are
          conscious that there is a God, though you yourself will sometimes deny
          it, you know very well that every conclusion to which this false
          reasoning of yours has brought you, is a downright falsehood, and a
          libel against the common-sense and sterling honesty of your nature.
          Oh! turn out, then, this wretch who is a descendant of the Father of
          Lies; and let us, each man of us, lay our hands on him as witnesses,
          and take up our stone to stone him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another accusation I bring against him is this: he has led you into a
          world of mischief. This habit of questioning has often blunted the
          edge of some sermon that you have heard; when the Word was coming
          right home to your conscience, this Mr. Evil Questioning has held up a
          shield and prevented the point from entering into your heart; besides
          that, have you not sometimes when under the influence of his delusive
          logic gone off to the place where your lust has been cultivated, and
          where your conscience hag been lulled to sleep? You know if it had not
          been for these questions, you would not be found so often in the
          tavern, or in the casino, or in the midst, perhaps, of even worse
          associations than these. It is because you have tried to make yourself
          an infidel that you have been able to go into sin. You have felt that
          if you did behave, sin would become unpleasant; in fact, you would be
          too gross a fool if you professed to believe, and then afterwards run
          and cut your own throat, and destroy your own soul, by persevering in
          your iniquities. Oh! I beseech you, remember the mischief this wicked
          habit has done you; it has brought you low, very low, even to the
          gates of hell; and if you persevere much longer in it, as I pray God
          you may not, it will bring you within the portals of hell. And then,
          when the gate of fire is shut, there is no arm that can open it, there
          is no question, no subtle questioning, that can administer a drop of
          comfort to you; there is no puzzling particle of metaphysics that can
          be as a drop of water to cool your burning tongue. The questioning
          that damned you shall be the tormentor that shall vex you, and your
          brain carried through fiery speculations shall for ever be horrified
          and alarmed by new difficulties and new mysteries, which shall be as
          faggots for the flames of hell for ever and for ever. Oh! let us bring
          out this Evil Questioning, and hang him on a gallows high as the
          gallows of Haman, and God grant that we may never see him again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have one other charge, and then I shall have closed up the
          accusation. Men and brethren, this man must die, for he has been a
          murderer. Oh! what millions of fools has Evil Questioning sent to
          hell! There are many gates to hell, but this is one of the widest and
          it is one of the most frequented, because it is a respectable gate.
          Men do not like to go do on to perdition without having some reason,
          some logic to back them up, so they carry a lie in their right hand,
          and then they go there quietly, to meet their damnation logically, and
          to reason about the flames of hell when they are lying in them. Oh! my
          dear hearers, let us have done with this Evil Questioning, for if not,
          he will ruin us, as surely as he has ruined others. Be satisfied with
          |Thus saith the Lord.| Take the Bible as it stands. Do not for ever be
          raising these doubts. Do not be busying yourself with secret things
          that are no business of yours whatever. Do not for ever be quibbling
          and putting these hard knotty points to us, while your poor soul is
          perishing for lack of that grace which alone can save you from the
          wrath to come. |Well,| says one, |but I mean to ask questions a little
          longer.| Ah! but my dear friend, remember the habit of evil
          questioning grows upon a man; and at last God will fill you with your
          own devices. Draws there nigh a day when you will want to believe and
          you cannot -- when questioning will come to be a strong delusion, so
          that you shall believe a lie -- when from merely trying to be an
          infidel, you shall become at last a master in the arts of Belial. Yea,
          you shall take your degree of Doctor in Damnation, and shall sit in
          the seat of the scorner, condemned, already hardened in your sin, and
          ripened for the fire, as those who are ready to be burned. God grant
          that may not be the consequence; but it will be unless Mr. Evil
          Questioning be speedily brought out, given up to the gallows, and
          never more harboured in your house.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus spoken in the form of an allegory. If I have put in some
          words of pleasantry, it was that I might engage your attention. I feel
          the subject to be awfully solemn, and it is necessary that we should
          all think of it, and I hope you will think of it none the less because
          it has been clothed somewhat in an allegorical form, and because I
          have tried to represent this evil habit as though it were an evil
          being that sought your destruction. My concluding head is especially
          addressed to the people of God, and to them I hope it will be very
          interesting.
        </p>

          IV. Old Mr. Evil Questioning is the father of a large family, and John
          Bunyan tells you about his family. He says, he married one called Miss
          No-hope, she was the daughter of old Dark, and when old Dark was dead,
          her uncle Incredulity took her and brought her up as his own daughter,
          and then he gave her to old Evil Questioning, and he had by her
          several children. I will give you the names of them, because it shall
          be my earnest endeavor to fire a shot at them this morning, as well as
          at their old father. Their names are these -- Mr. Doubt, Mr. Legal
          Life, Mr. Unbelief, Mr. Wrong Thoughts of Christ, Mr. Clip Promise,
          Mr. Carnal Sense, Mr. Live-by-Feeling, and Mr. Self Love. All these
          were the offspring of the father, and against all these a warrant was
          issued by the prince Immanuel that they should be hunted down, and
          every one of them given to the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I will take the eldest son, there is Mr. Doubt, -- Is he not the
          child of Evil Questioning? Why, you can see his father's image in his
          face. You remember Mr. Doubt called one day at the tent of Sarah, and
          his father with him, and Sarah said, |Shall I who am ninety years of
          age have pleasure? shall these breasts afford nourishment for a
          child?| Here was Evil Questioning; and then Sarah laughed. That was
          Mr. Doubt that played off a bit of his satire, and set her laughing.
          Ah! had she but believed, she might have attained a nobler
          commendation. It almost tarnishes her fair reputation that we must
          remember this of her -- she was the woman who laughed at God's
          promise, as though it were impossible. Brothers and sisters, Mr. Doubt
          has often called at your house and made you cast reflections on the
          promise. He has said, |How can it be true? Such a sinner as you, so
          weak, so vile, so unworthy.| Oh believer, the promise is true; God has
          pledged his word and stamped his covenant with his oath. When you see
          a promise, never doubt it; for Doubt is the descendant of Evil
          Questioning, and he is a Diabolian from the birth up. However, I am
          rather apprehensive, though I publish his name to-day, and though I
          were to give you his portrait in the Hue anti Cry, he will not get
          arrested just yet, or if he be arrested, I am afraid he will break his
          prison, and be at liberty again. For this Mr. Doubt is everywhere
          about the country; and I find him in many a secluded nook by the
          way-side, troubling some poor woman on her dying bed, and I find him,
          too, in many a hall where the rich man is thinking about Christ, but
          is kept back by this troublesome intruder, who whispers a doubt as to
          whether Christ will receive him. He is everywhere -- but drive him
          out; make him hide his head, let him not be pampered and fed as he is
          by some people, lest Doubt grow into Despair, and you should lose your
          comfort, and bring sorrow into your heart for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another child is Mr. Clip-Promise. Do you know him? He does not doubt
          the promise, but he clips the edge of it. He makes out that it will
          not all be fulfilled, only a part of it. Now there is a proclamation
          issued against Mr. Clip Promise, that whoever will arrest him shall be
          greatly honored, for he is a notorious villian, by whose doings much
          of the King's coin was abased, therefore it was expedient that he
          should be made a public example. And, Bunyan says, |They did take him,
          and they first set him in the pillory, and afterwards they tied his
          hands behind him and they whipped him through the streets of Mansoul,
          bidding all the children and servants whip him, and then at last they
          hanged him. And,| says mine author, |this may seem very hard
          treatment, but when one considers how much loss the town of Mansoul
          may sustain by the clipping of the promises which are the coins with
          which they trade, I can only say I hope that all his kith and kin may
          be treated with the like severity.| Oh! it you have attempted to cut
          the promise down, have done with it I pray you; and do take it as it
          stands in all its plenteousness of grace and all its sufficiency.
          Judge it not by your own notions, but take it as it comes from God,
          shining and glittering from the mint of heaven. Take it at its full
          current value with the merchants, and you shall surely have its
          equivalent in the fulfilments which God will work to you in his
          providence and his grace. Moreover, I will say this unto thee, the
          more thou tradest with this precious coin the more thou wilt prize it,
          as Eskine sings --
        </p>
        <p>|Let thy experience sweet declare,</p>
        <p>If able to remind,</p>
        <p>A Bochim here, a Bethel there,</p>
        <p>Thy Savior made thee find.|</p>
        <p>
          Then there is Mr. Wrong-thoughts of Christ. Do you know him? Well I do
          not know that I have met him very lately, but there was a time when he
          and I had a great battle, and I think he had the worst of it, for by
          grace I was enabled to strike him very hard. Do you know what this
          fellow had the impudence to tell me? He said, |Oh! Christ will never
          receive such a sinner as you are.| And when I had come to Christ, and
          he received me, he said, |Oh! Christ will not hold you fast.| He will
          it you let him, but then you will not let him, for you are such a
          sinner he cannot hold you, and he will not. He has often made me doubt
          my Master's immutability or his faithfulness, or his power to save.
          But as far as I am personally concerned of late, I was able to seize
          him, and I have laid him in prison; I think he is dying of a
          consumption, for I have not heard much of him lately. Glad enough
          shall I be to have him buried once for all. And if any of you are
          troubled with him, lock him up, do not let him keep abroad, for
          Wrong-thoughts of Christ is one of the worst spirits that ever came up
          from the pit. What! to think badly of Christ, to think of him who is
          all goodness, as if he were hard-hearted or unkind. Begone, Wrong
          thoughts of Christ, we will not harbour thee but will put thee in
          durance vile, and there shalt thou starve and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two others whom some of you may have known, Mr. Legal Life,
          and Mr. Live-by-Feeling. I think they were twins. Mr. Legal Life
          sometimes gets hold of the Christian and makes him judge himself by
          legal evidences, and not by evangelical evidence. When the Christian
          has kept a commandment, Mr. Legal Life will say, |There now you live
          by your works.| He knows that Christians would die by their works, and
          that the best of them can only live by faith. And when a Christian has
          made a slip, and has not kept the commandment, in comes Mr. Legal
          Life, and he says, |You are a lost soul, for you have not kept the
          commandment;| though he knows right well, |that if any man sin, we
          have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.| Yet he
          tries to make his life by the law which no Christian ever did do or
          ever will do, for the law is of death and not of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is Mr. Live-by-Feeling, who makes us judge ourselves
          according to what we feel. If we feel happy and devout, |Oh,| he says.
          |now you are in a blessed frame, the Master will accept you,| anon you
          feel unhappy, and dull, and cold, and dead. |Oh,| says Mr.
          Live-by-Feeling, |you are no child of God, or else you would not be
          like this.| Now catch both these fellows, if you can, and away with
          them; away with such fellows from the earth. It is not fit that they
          should live. Come, ye Christians, and crucify them, nail them up, they
          are relatives of the old flesh, and let them die with the flesh; they
          will never bring you any good; they are the down-right direct
          opponents of the gospel. Away with them, for |Whatsoever is not of
          faith is sin;| and if we believe not on the Lord Jesus Christ, neither
          our feelings nor our efforts can ever save our souls in any measure
          whatsoever. Legal Life, and Live-by-Feeling must be put to the death.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I want your attention, because here is a fine opportunity for
          some of you to become celebrated and rich, if you are able to fully
          the commission. One of the children of old Evil Questioning was Mr.
          Carnal-Sense. Now John Bunyan tells us, and I believe that he is
          right, at least I have his authority for it, and that is no mean
          authority, that there is a proclamation set up in the market place at
          Man-Soul, that whosoever shall bring Mr. Carnal-Sense, dead or alive,
          to the King Immanuel, shall be made a nobleman, shall have a right to
          sit at the King's table every day, and moreover, he shall be made
          keeper of the treasury of the city of Man-Soul. There you see is a
          noble opportunity for you. But, with John Bunyan, |It is rather
          unfavorable if you are ambitious; many there were that spent much of
          their time in endeavoring to discover him, but they have never been
          able to find him; still it is well known that he is abroad, and that
          he frequents poor men's houses by night very much to their sorrow and
          grief.| Now if you can but lay hold of him, see how you shall be
          exalted; you shall have daily fellowship with your king, and you shall
          have the whole treasure of God to make you rich. Well, blessed be God,
          we do know one thing, that is, that if we cannot kill Carnal-Sense,
          yet we can starve him a little, and if he will come abroad it shall be
          by night, for we will not let him come abroad in the day. Old
          Carnal-Sense, what mischief has he done!
        </p>
        <p>|Judge not the Lord by carnal sense,</p>
        <p>But trust him for his grace,</p>
        <p>Behind a frowning providence,</p>
        <p>He hides a smiling face.|</p>
        <p>
          Oh! Christians, get rid of the thought that thou canst judge thy God
          by carnal appearances, do not take the promise by the providence, but
          the providence by the promise. Do not read the book of life by thy
          life, but read thy life by the book of life. Have done with Carnal
          Sense and thou shalt be happy, thou shalt have daily fellowship with
          God and all the riches of his treasury.
        </p>
        <p>
          There remains another one upon whom I must speak just for a minute. It
          is one called Mr. Self-Love. Ah, he is one of the biggest of the
          children of Mr. Evil Questioning. Now Mr. Self-Love was tried and
          condemned to die, but he had so many friends in the city, that they
          did not like to hang him outright. There was, however, a brave man in
          the king's army, a common soldier, a man that was need to sleep out in
          the fields at night, and to do much hard work -- his name was Mr.
          Self-Denial, and coming out from the midst of the crowd, just when the
          prisoner was going to be acquitted, he said, |If such villains as
          these are winked at in Man-soul I will lay down my commission.| He
          then took him from the crowd and had him among the soldiers, and there
          he was put to death. For this, the king made the common soldier a
          lord, and he was honored in the town of Mansoul. |Though,| says
          Bunyan, |there were a good many people in the town that did not like
          it, and they used to mutter at it, but they did not say much as long
          as king Immanuel was there. Oh, do you know that old Self-Love? You
          will never get rid of him unless you get Mr. Self-Denial to help you;
          unless you are ready to deny the affections and lusts, to pluck out
          right eyes, and cut off right hands, and to yield up one delight after
          another, that so self may be trodden under foot, and Jesus Christ may
          be all in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other child. I have left him to the last; and then I have
          done with the family -- Mr. Unbelief |Now,| says Bunyan, |Unbelief was
          a nimble fellow.| He was often caught, but he was like the hero of the
          wicked Shepherd, he always broke his prison and was out again.
          Although he has often been kept in hold, he has always escaped, and he
          is every day about somewhere or other. Oh, brothers and sisters,
          Unbelief is abroad to-day, he will be attacking some of you, seeking
          to rend your jewels from you. I beseech you, do not harbour him, but
          do live by faith, remember you how many die by unbelief; therefore
          cling ye -- cling to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>|And when thine eye of faith is dim,</p>
        <p>Still trust in Jesus, sink or swim;</p>
        <p>And at his footstool bow the knee,</p>
        <p>So Israel's' God thy peace shall be.|</p>
        <p>
          When thine evidences are dark and thy joys are gone, still throw thine
          arms about the cross; and remember, thou canst never perish trusting
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thou, poor sinner, this last word to thee. Have done with thy
          questionings, end thy questions all of them, at the cross of Christ.
          Look to my Master now: a look will save you. Trust him, and you are
          saved -- saved now and saved for ever. Cast yourself on him. Have done
          with your own wit and wisdom; take him to be your wisdom, your
          righteousness, your all, and he will not cast you away. Poor soul! he
          will take you in, though you are black as Satan himself. He will wash
          you and make you clean; he will take you to himself, and put the crown
          of immortality upon your head; he will robe you in the garments of
          glory; and you shall be his in that day when he maketh up his jewels.
