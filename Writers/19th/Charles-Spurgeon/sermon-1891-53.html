          1. But what sort of talk also is this concerning their seed -- that it
          was conceived by the mother according to the configuration of those
          angels who wait upon the Saviour, -- shapeless, without form, and
          imperfect; and that it was deposited in the Demiurge without his
          knowledge, in order that through his instrumentality it might attain
          to perfection and form in that soul which he had, [so to speak,]
          filled with seed? This is to affirm, in the first place, that those
          angels who wait upon their Saviour are imperfect, and without figure
          or form; if indeed that which was conceived according to their
          appearance was generated any such kind of being [as has been
          described].
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, in the next place, as to their saying that the Creator was
          ignorant of that deposit of seed which took place into him, and again,
          of that impartation of seed which was made by him to man, their words
          are futile and vain, and are in no way susceptible of proof. For how
          could he have been ignorant of it, if that seed had possessed any
          substance and peculiar properties? If, on the other hand, it was
          without substance and without quality, and so was really nothing,
          then, as a matter of course, he was ignorant of it. For those things
          which have a certain motion of their own, and quality, either of heat,
          or swiftness, or sweetness, or which differ from others in brilliance,
          do not escape the notice even of men, since they mingle in the sphere
          of human action: far less can they [be hidden from] God, the Maker of
          this universe. With reason, however, [is it said, that] their seed was
          not known to Him, since it is without any quality of general utility,
          and without the substance requisite for any action, and is, in fact, a
          pure nonentity. It really seems to me, that, with a view to such
          opinions, the Lord expressed Himself thus: |For every idle word that
          men speak, they shall give account on the day of judgment.| For all
          teachers of a like character to these, who fill men's ears with idle
          talk, shall, when they stand at the throne of judgment, render an
          account for those things which they have vainly imagined and falsely
          uttered against the Lord, proceeding, as they have done, to such a
          height of audacity as to declare of themselves that, on account of the
          substance of their seed, they are acquainted with the spiritual
          Pleroma, because that man who dwells within reveals to them the true
          Father; for the animal nature required to be disciplined by means of
          the senses. But [they hold that] the Demiurge, while receiving into
          himself the whole of this seed, through its being deposited in him by
          the Mother, still remained utterly ignorant of all things, and had no
          understanding of anything connected with the Pleroma.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And that they are the truly |spiritual,| inasmuch as a certain
          particle of the Father of the universe has been deposited in their
          souls, since, according to their assertions, they have souls formed of
          the same substance as the Demiurge himself, yet that he, although he
          received from the Mother, once for all, the whole [of the divine]
          seed, and possessed it in himself, still remained of an animal nature,
          and had not the slightest understanding of those things which are
          above, which things they boast that they themselves understand, while
          they are still on earth; -- does not this crown all possible
          absurdity? For to imagine that the very same seed conveyed knowledge
          and perfection to the souls of these men, while it only gave rise to
          ignorance in the God who made them, is an opinion that can be held
          only by those utterly frantic, and totally destitute of common sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Further, it is also a most absurd and groundless thing for them to
          say that the seed was, by being thus deposited, reduced to form and
          increased, and so was prepared for all the reception of perfect
          rationality. For there will be in it an admixture of matter -- that
          substance which they hold to have been derived from ignorance and
          defect; [and this will prove itself] more apt and useful than was the
          light of their Father, if indeed, when born, according to the
          contemplation of that [light], it was without form or figure, but
          derived from this [matter], form, and appearance, and increase, and
          perfection. For if that light which proceeds from the Pleroma was the
          cause to a spiritual being that it possessed neither form, nor
          appearance, nor its own special magnitude, while its descent to this
          world added all these things to it, and brought it to perfection, then
          a sojourn here (which they also term darkness) would seem much more
          efficacious and useful than was the light of their Father. But how can
          it be regarded as other than ridiculous, to affirm that their mother
          ran the risk of being almost extinguished in matter, and was almost on
          the point of being destroyed by it, had she not then with difficulty
          stretched herself outwards, and leaped, [as it were,] out of herself,
          receiving assistance from the Father; but that her seed increased in
          this same matter, and received a form, and was made fit for the
          reception of perfect rationality; and this, too, while |bubbling up|
          among substances dissimilar and unfamiliar to itself, according to
          their own declaration that the earthly is opposed to the spiritual,
          and the spiritual to the earthly? How, then, could |a little
          particle,| as they say, increase, and receive shape, and reach
          perfection, in the midst of substances contrary to and unfamiliar to
          itself?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But further, and in addition to what has been said, the question
          occurs, Did their mother, when she beheld the angels, bring forth the
          seed all at once, or only one by one [in succession]? If she brought
          forth the whole simultaneously and at once, that which was thus
          produced cannot now be of an infantile character: its descent,
          therefore, into those men who now exist must be superfluous. But if
          one by one, then she did not form her conception according to the
          figure of those angels whom she beheld; for, contemplating them all
          together, and once for all, so as to conceive by them, she ought to
          have brought forth once for all the offspring of those from whose
          forms she had once for all conceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Why was it, too, that, beholding the angels along with the Saviour,
          she did indeed conceive their images, but not that of the Saviour, who
          is far more beautiful than they? Did He not please her; and did she
          not, on that account, conceive after His likeness? How was it, too,
          that the Demiurge, whom they can call an animal being, having, as they
          maintain, his own special magnitude and figure, was produced perfect
          as respects his substance; while that which is spiritual, which also
          ought to be more effective than that which is animal, was sent forth
          imperfect, and he required to descend into a soul, that in it he might
          obtain form, and thus becoming perfect, might be rendered fit for the
          reception of perfect reason? If, then, he obtains form in mere earthly
          and animal men, he can no longer be said to be after the likeness of
          angels whom they call lights, but [after the likeness] of those men
          who are here below. For he will not possess in that case the likeness
          and appearance of angels, but of those souls in whom also he receives
          shape; just as water when poured into a vessel takes the form of that
          vessel, and if on any occasion it happens to congeal in it, it will
          acquire the form of the vessel in which it has thus been frozen, since
          souls themselves possess the figure of the body [in which they dwell];
          for they themselves have been adapted to the vessel [in which they
          exist], as I have said before. If, then, that seed [referred to] is
          here solidified and formed into a definite shape, it will possess the
          figure of a man. and not the form of the angels. How is it possible,
          therefore, that that seed should be after images of the angels, seeing
          it has obtained a form after the likeness of men? Why, again, since it
          was of a spiritual nature, had it any need of descending into flesh?
          For what is carnal stands in need of that which is spiritual, if
          indeed it is to be saved, that in it it may be sanctified and cleared
          from all impurity, and that what is mortal may be swallowed up by
          immortality; but that which is spiritual has no need whatever of those
          things which are here below. For it is not we who benefit it, but it
          that improves us.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Still more manifestly is that talk of theirs concerning their seed
          proved to be false, and that in a way which must be evident to every
          one, by the fact that they declare those souls which have received
          seed from the Mother to be superior to all others; wherefore also they
          have been honoured by the Demiurge, and constituted princes, and
          kings, and priests. For if this were true, the high priest Caiaphas,
          and Annas, and the rest of the chief priests, and doctors of the law,
          and rulers of the people, would have been the first to believe in the
          Lord, agreeing as they did with respect to that relationship; and even
          before them should have been Herod the king. But since neither he, nor
          the chief priests, nor the rulers, nor the eminent of the people,
          turned to Him [in faith], but, on the contrary, those who sat begging
          by the highway, the deaf, and the blind, while He was rejected and
          despised by others, according to what Paul declares, |For ye see your
          calling, brethren, that there are not many wise men among you, not
          many noble, not many mighty; but those things of the world which were
          despised hath God chosen.| Such souls, therefore, were not superior to
          others on account of the seed deposited in them, nor on this account
          were they honoured by the Demiurge.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. As to the point, then, that their system is weak and untenable as
          well as utterly chimerical, enough has been said. For it is not
          needful, to use a common proverb, that one should drink up the ocean
          who wishes to learn that its water is salt. But, just as in the case
          of a statue which is made of clay, but coloured on the outside that it
          may be thought to be of gold, while it really is of clay, any one who
          takes out of it a small particle, and thus laying it open reveals the
          clay, will set free those who seek the truth from a false opinion; in
          the same way have I (by exposing not a small part only, but the
          several heads of their system which are of the greatest importance)
          shown to as many as do not wish wittingly to be led astray, what is
          wicked, deceitful, seductive, and pernicious, connected with the
          school of the Valentinians, and all those other heretics who
          promulgate wicked opinions respecting the Demiurge, that is, the
          Fashioner and Former of this universe, and who is in fact the only
          true God -- exhibiting, [as I have done,] how easily their views are
          overthrown.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. For who that has any intelligence, and possesses only a small
          proportion of truth, can tolerate them, when they affirm that there is
          another god above the Creator; and that there is another Monogenes as
          well as another Word of God, whom also they describe as having been
          produced in [a state of] degeneracy; and another Christ, whom they
          assert to have been formed, along with the Holy Spirit, later than the
          rest of the Æons; and another Saviour, who, they say, did not proceed
          from the Father of all, but was a kind of joint production of those
          Æons who were formed in [a state of] degeneracy, and that He was
          produced of necessity on account of this very degeneracy? It is thus
          their opinion that, unless the Æons had been in a state of ignorance
          and degeneracy, neither Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor Horos, nor
          the Saviour, nor the angels, nor their Mother, nor her seed, nor the
          rest of the fabric of the world, would have been produced at all; but
          the universe would have been a desert, and destitute of the many good
          things which exist in it. They are therefore not only chargeable with
          impiety against the Creator, declaring Him the fruit of a defect, but
          also against Christ and the Holy Spirit, affirming that they were
          produced on account of that defect; and, in like manner, that the
          Saviour [was produced] subsequently to [the existence of] that defect.
          And who will tolerate the remainder of their vain talk, which they
          cunningly endeavour to accommodate to the parables, and have in this
          way plunged both themselves, and those who give credit to them, in the
          profoundest depths of impiety?<br />
