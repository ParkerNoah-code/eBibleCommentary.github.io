        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.264)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 24th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |That thou mayest bear thing own shame, and mayest be confounded in
          all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.| --
          Ezekiel 16:54.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS NOT a comfortable state to be at enmity with God, and the sinner
          knows this. Although he perseveres in his rebellion against the Most
          High, and turns not at the rebuke of the Almighty, but still goeth on
          in his iniquity, desperately seeking his own destruction, yet is he
          aware in his own conscience that he is not in a secure position. Hence
          it is that all wicked men are constantly on the look out for excuses.
          They find these either in pretended resolutions to reform at some
          future period, or else in the declaration that reformation is out of
          their power, and that, acting according to their own nature, they must
          continue to go on in their iniquities. When a man is willing to find
          an excuse for being God's enemy he need never be at a loss. He who
          hath to find a fact may find some difficulty; but he who would forge a
          lie may sit at his own fireside and do it. Now, the excuses of sinners
          are all of them false; they are refuges of lies; and therefore we need
          not wonder that they are exceedingly numerous, and very easy to come
          at.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way in which sinners frequently excuse themselves is by
          endeavoring to get some apology for their own iniquities from the
          inconsistencies of God's people. This is the reason why there is much
          slander in the world. A true Christian is a rebuke to the sinner,
          wherever he goes he is a living protest against the evil of sin. Hence
          it is that the worldling makes a dead set upon a pious man. His
          language in his heart is, |He accuses me to my face; I cannot bear the
          sight of his holy character; it makes the blackness of my own life
          appear the more terrible, when I see the whiteness of his innocence
          contrasting with it.| And then the worldling opens all his eyes, and
          labors to find a fault with the virtuous. If, however, he fails to do
          so, he will next try to invent a fault; he will slander the man; and
          if even there he fails, and the man is like Job, |perfect and upright,
          and one that feared God and eschewed evil;| then the sinner will, like
          the devil of old, begin to impute some wrong motive to the Christian's
          innocency. |Doth Job serve God for nought?| said the devil. He could
          find no fault with Job whatever, his character was untainted and
          unblemished; but, says he, |he keeps to his religion for what he gets
          by it.| I reckon it to be a glorious accusation when we are falsely
          charged with being religious for the sake of gain. It shows that our
          enemies have no other charge that they can bring against us. They have
          ransacked all the flies of their calumny, and they can find nothing
          tangible, and this is the last they can bring -- an imputation upon
          the motive of the man who has no other motive in all the world than to
          glorify his God and win sinners from destruction. In this, then, let
          us glory. If sinners slander us, it is because we make them uneasy.
          They see that our lives are a protest against them: and what can they
          do? They must somehow or other answer the Bill which we have filed
          against them in Heaven's Chancery, and they do it by issuing a
          Rejoinder against us, and bringing us in as defendants in the case. We
          glory in this, that we are defendants who can prove our innocence, and
          we are not ashamed to stand before the her of God to have our motives
          tried. There is much I say to cheer us in the fact of such a libel. We
          know the work is done. We are sure our shots have told on their armor,
          when they are driven to return on us their calumnies and the venom of
          their wrath. Now we know that they feel the might of our arm, now we
          know we are not like them, mere drivellings and dwarfs. They have felt
          our might, and against it they kick, they foam, they forth their
          wrath. In this, I say, we glory. We have smitten them hard, or else
          they would not rise against us in this fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas! alas! however, sinners have not always to use calumny and lies.
          It is too true that the church has given a real bona fide cause to the
          wicked for excusing themselves in their sin: the inconsistencies of
          professors, the want of heart in piety, the absence of devout
          earnestness, have given sad grounds to the ungodly to justify
          themselves in their sin. It is upon this melancholy subject that I am
          about to enter this morning; and may God grant unto all his people who
          shall feel convicted in their consciences, the spirit of mourning and
          contrition, that they may vex themselves before God, and confess this
          great iniquity that they have done, namely, that they have comforted
          sinners in their sin by their own inconsistency, and have justified
          the wicked in their rebellion by their own rebellings and revoltings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I shall deal thus with the subject. First, I shall point
          out the fact -- the different acts of Christians which have helped to
          comfort sinners in their sin; and then, secondly, I shall observe the
          consequences of this evil -- how much the world at large has been
          injured by the deeds of professed followers of Christ; and then I
          shall come with a solemn warning, bringing out the great battering
          ram, to dash against these refuges of lies and moreover crying with a
          loud voice to those who are the faithful servants of Christ, to
          withdraw their hands, and no longer to assist in keeping up the
          Jericho in which the wicked have entrenched themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, it shall be my sad and melancholy business this
          morning to show certain facts which it were dishonest to deny, namely,
          that THE ACTS OF MANY OF CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF
          JUSTIFYING AND COMFORTINGS SINNERS IN THEIR EVIL WAYS.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And first I would observe, that the daily inconsistencies of the
          people of God have much to do in this matter. By inconsistencies I do
          not exactly mean those grosser crimes into which, at sad and mournful
          periods, many professors fall; but I mean those frequent
          inconsistencies which become so common indeed that they are scarcely
          condemned by society.
        </p>
        <p>
          The covetousness of too many Christians has had this offset. |Look,|
          says the worldling, |this man professes that his inheritance is above,
          and that his affection is set not on things on earth, but on the
          things of heaven but look at him, he is just as earnest as I am about
          the things of this world; he can drive the screw home as tightly with
          his debtor as I can; he can scrape and cut with those that deal with
          him quite as keenly as ever I have done.| Nay, beloved, this is not a
          mere tale; alas! I have seen persons held up to commendation as
          successful merchants, whose lives will not bear the test of Scripture,
          whose business transactions were as hard as griping, as grasping, as
          the transactions of the most worldly. How often has it happened that
          some of you have bent your knee in the sanctuary, and have said,
          |Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,| and one hour
          afterwards your finger has been almost meeting your thumb through the
          jugular vein of some debtor whom you had seized by the throat! The
          church of Christ appears to be as worldly as the world itself, and
          professors of religion have become as sharp in trade and as ungenerous
          in their dealing as those that have never been baptised into the Lord
          Jesus, and have never professed to serve him. And now what does the
          world say? It throws this in our teeth. If it be accused of loving the
          things of time and sense, it answers, |And so do you.| If we tell the
          world that it has set its hopes upon a shadow, it replica, |But we
          have set our hope upon the self-same thing in which you are trusting;
          you are as worldly, as grasping, as covetous as we are; your protest
          has lost its force; you are no longer witnesses against us -- we are
          accusers of you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point in which the sinner often excuses himself is the
          manifest worldliness of many Christians. You will see Christian men
          and women as fond of dress, and as pleased with the frivolities of the
          age, as any other persons possibly could be, just as anxious to adorn
          their outward persons, so as to be seen of men; just as ambitious to
          win the praise which fools accord to fine dressing, as the most silly
          fop or the most gaudy among worldly women. What saith the world, when
          we turn round to it, and accuse it of being a mere butterfly, and
          finding all its pleasures in gaudy toys? |Oh! yes,| it says, |we know
          your cant, but it is just the same with you.| Do you not stand up and
          sing,
        </p>
        <p>|Jewels to me are gaudy toys,</p>
        <p>And gold but sordid dust?|</p>
        <p>
          And yet you are just as fond of glittering as we are; your doctors of
          divinity pride themselves just as much in their D.D. as any of us in
          other titles. You are Just as punctillious about terms of honor as any
          of us can be. You talk about carrying the cross; but we do not see it
          anywhere, except it be a golden cross sometimes hanging on your bosom.
          You say you are crucified to the world, and the world to you: it is a
          very merry sort of crucifixion. You say that you mortify your members
          and deny yourselves: your mortification must be suffered in secret,
          for it is but very little that we can see of it! Thus the worldling
          casts back to our challenge, declaring that we are not sincere, and
          thus he comforts himself a his sin, and justifies himself in his
          iniquity,
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, too, at the manifest pride of many professors of religion. You
          see members of Christian churches as proud as they possibly can be.
          Their backs are as stiff as if an iron rod were in the center, they
          come up to the house of God, and it is a Christian doctrine that God
          has made of one flesh all nations that dwell upon the face of the
          earth, but the Christian is as aristocratic as anybody else, just as
          proud and just as stiff. Is the Christian clothed in broad cloth? How
          often does be feel it a condescension to own a smock frock! and how
          often do you see a sister of Christ in satin, who thinks it something
          wonderful if she owns a fellow-member in an unwashable print. It is of
          no use denying it. I do not think that the evil is so common amongst
          us as it is in some churches; but this I know, that there are
          respectable churches and chapels in which a poor man scarcely dares to
          show his face. The pride of the church surely has become almost as
          great as the pride of Sodom of old. Her fullness of bread and her
          stiffness of neck hath brought her to exalt herself; and whereas it is
          the real glory of the church that |the poor have the gospel preached
          unto them,| and that the poor have received the Word with gladness, it
          becomes now the honor of the church to talk of her respectability of
          the dignity and station of her members, and of the greatness of her
          wealth. What, then, do worldlings say? |You accuse us of pride, you
          are as proud as we are. You the humble followers of Jesus, who washed
          his saints' feet? Not you; no, you would have no objection, we doubt
          not to be washed by others, but we do not think it likely that you
          would ever wash ours. You the disciples of the fishermen of Galilee?
          Not you; you are too fine and great for that. Accuse us not of pride:
          why, you are as stiff-necked a generation, as we ourselves are.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, these are only mentioned amongst us as inconsistencies -- not as
          sins. Sins they verily are; and they are such sins that they restrain
          the Spirit of God from blessing the church. Sins, too, they are that
          render the wicked callous in their sins, blunt the edge of our
          rebukes, and prevents the Word of God from working in the hearts of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might mention another sad fact with regard to the church, which
          often stings us sorely, -- the various enmities, and strifes, and
          divisions, that arise. You tell the worldly man that Christians love
          each other. |Ah!| says he, |you should go over to Ebenezer or to
          Rehoboth, and see how they love each other. Don't talk of leading a
          cat and dog life! Look at many of your churches; see how the minister
          is treated, and how the deacons are in arms, and how the members hate
          one another. They can scarcely hold a church meeting without abusing
          each other!| How often is this proved to be true in many churchesl And
          then the worldling says, |You tell us that we bite and devour each
          other, and that our wars and fightings come from our lusts. Where do
          your wars and fightings is come from? You tell us that our anger and
          wrath are the effect of sin that dwelleth in us: what causes your
          divisions and your strifes?| In this way, you see, the testimony of
          the children of God is rendered invalid, and we help to comfort
          sinners in their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Now it is my mournful duty to go a step further. It is not merely
          these inconsistencies, but the glaring crimes of some professed
          disciples, thee have greatly assisted sinners in sheltering themselves
          from the attacks of the Word of God. Every now and then the cedar
          falls in the midst of the forest. Some one who stood prominent in the
          church of God, as a professed follower of Jesus, turns aside. |They go
          out from us because they were not of us; for if they had been of us,
          doubtless, they would have continued with us, but they went out from
          us, that it might be manifest that they were not of us.| We have wept
          over high professors becoming drunkards; we have seen mighty men at
          religious public meetings becoming scoundrel bankrupts. We have had it
          dashed in our faces, dozens of times, that religion how often become a
          cloak for fraud, and that when the world has trusted a religious man
          with its wealth, that religious man has carried it off with him, and
          has not been found at the proper time. Oh! this is the great curse of
          the church. I was thinking only yesterday, with much sorrow in my
          heart, of the present age, and I could not but come to the conclusion,
          that all the burnings of Pagan tyrants, that all the tortures of
          Popish executioners, that all the bloody deaths to which God's people
          were ever put, in any one age of the world, have never done so much
          hurt to the cause of Christ as the inconsistencies of professors of
          the present time. It was about three years ago I think, that failures
          among religious men seemed to be the order of the day, and our papers
          literally teemed with accusations against the church of God. O my
          brethren, let us not talk of these things, except with mourning and
          tears. Wrap thyself in sackcloth, O church of God; put away thy
          laughter, and cast ashes on thine head, for the crown of thy glory is
          departed, thy garments are stained, and the filthiness of thy skirts
          witnesses against thee. O church of Christ, thy Nazarites were purer
          than snow, they were whiter than milk, but now their visage is blacker
          than a coal, and their hands are defiled with iniquity. Remember thou
          the time of thy purity, when thy priests were glorious, and thy sons
          and daughters were clothed in royal apparel. How art thou fallen! how
          art thou cast down from the high mountains! Thy princes are clothed in
          rags; the veils are plucked from the face of thy daughters, and thou
          thyself art become disconsolate and a widow, by reason of the iniquity
          of thy sons and of thy daughters. Woe unto us, for thy glory is
          departed, thy sun is covered with thick darkness, and thy stars
          withhold their light. The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us
          that we have sinned.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hearers, my soul has carried me away; breathless and panting I
          return to my humbler but not less earnest style. Remember how vast
          your powers for mischief! Your ministers may preach as long as they
          will; but you undo their preaching if you are unholy. If you are
          inconsistent in your lives, Paul, Apollos, and Cephas might preach
          with power; but they have not half the power to build up that you have
          to pull down. You are the mightiest workmen ye professors of religion;
          you can undo infinitely more than we can accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I pause, and relieve the shadow of this subject with something
          which, I fear, is in the sight of God equally vile. How often do the
          people of God comfort sinners in their sins by their murmurings and
          their complaints? Oh beloved, we are too much in the habit of covering
          our faces with sadness, on account of our temporal trials, and too
          little in the habit of weeping on account of the failings of the
          church of God! Hour frequently do you meet with a true Christian full
          of unbelieving cares! Ah! he says, |All these things are against me.|
          He has food and raiment, but he is not content with it; he has more
          than that, but his store is a little diminished, and he is very cast
          down, and he has no faith, and cannot trust the Lord. |Oh!| says the
          worldling, |see these Christians; they talk about faith, but their
          faith is not of half so much service to them, as my desperation is to
          me that hardens my heart, and makes me stand up against affliction a
          great deal better than their faith in God's providence can do. Why,
          just look at these saints: -- a drivelling set of crying creatures,
          they never have either peace or joy; they are everlastingly pulling
          long faces, and talking through their noses, about their sad trials
          and troubles; they never have an hour of happiness. Who would be a
          Christian? I don't want to be converted,| says the worldling. |Why
          should I pluck out the sunbeam from my eye, and take the smile from my
          brow? Why should I profess to follow a God whose servants only worship
          him by weeping,and never offer any sacrifice but that of groans, and
          sighs, and murmurs?| Might not a wicked man come in often, when
          Christians are grumbling together about the badness of the times,
          about the high price of commodities, and the low rate of wages, and so
          forth; and might he not say, |Yes, I can see your God treats you very
          badly; if I were you I'd strike, and have nothing to do with him?| And
          he would go away laughing, and saying, |Ah! Baal treats me better; I
          get more pleasure in this world than these Christian people do. Let
          them have their brave heaven to themselves, if they like; I'm not
          going snivelling through this world with them; let me have joy and
          rejoicing while I may.| Don't you think that in this way you and I
          have done a world of damage to the cause of Christ, and may have
          helped to comfort sinners in their iniquities?
        </p>
        <p>
          One other point, and I will have done with this. Perhaps the greatest
          evil has been done by the coldheartedness, and indifference of
          religious professors. I charge thee not, O church of God, with
          inconsistency; I lay no crime at thy door now; it is with another
          fault I charge thee -- one as grievous these. I pray thee, plead
          guilty to it, for thou wilt but speak the truth, and then I pray God
          that this thy guilt may be cleansed, and that thou mayest offend him
          no longer with this thine evil. The church of God at the present age,
          is cold and lukewarm, and lifeless, compared with what it used to be.
          When I was preaching in Wales this week, I could not but observe the
          power which attended the ministry, when there was a living
          congregation and an earnest company gathered together to hear the Word
          of God. We have become accustomed to sit in a kind of solemn silence
          to hear the gospel. Not so in Wales. There is to be heard the voice of
          acclamation; every person expresses the feelings of his soul in
          audible prayers and cries to God; and at last, when the Spirit has
          descended, you hear the loud cries of |Gogoniant,| -- |Glory to God.|
          As each precious sentence drops from the lips of the preacher, it
          seems to be taken up and fed upon by the people, while they shout
          aloud for joy. I believe it is a great improvement on our English
          congregations, and some of our English preachers could not go on in
          their dull style, if sometimes the people had a chance of either
          hissing them or cheering them on. That, however, is but an index of
          the cold state of the churches. We are a phlegmatic, cold nation; even
          Scotch divines are more alive than we are, they speak the Word of God
          with more earnestness than many of our ministers do in England. Cold
          as we think the north is, yet hath even it become warmer than we are.
          And now what says the world to all our coldness? Why, it says -- |Ah,
          this is the kind of religion we like,| says the worldling; |we don't
          like those raving Methodists; we can't stand them; we don't like those
          earnest indefatigable Christians of the cars of Whitfield; oh! no,
          they were a raving set of folks; we don't like them; but we like these
          quiet folks.| |Yes,| says the worldling, |I think it is quite right
          that every man should go to his church and his chapel on a Sunday; but
          I never could go and hear such raving as Mr. So-and-so gives.| Of
          course you could not; you are an enemy to God, and that is why you
          like a Laodicean church. That very church which the world likes best
          is sure to be that which God abhors. The world says, |We like
          everything to go on smoothly; we like a man to go to his own parish
          church, and hear a good, solid, substantial sermon read; we like to go
          up to the meeting house, and hear a sober, eloquent divine; we don't
          like any of this furious preaching, any of these earnest
          exhortations.| No, of course you like that of which God has said,
          |Thou art neither cold nor hot;| God hates such, and that is why
          sinners love it. But what effect does all this have upon the
          worldling? Why, just this. He says, |I like you, because you don't
          rebuke me; I like that kind of religion, because it is no accusation
          against me. When I see a Christian hot and in earnest about being
          saved,| he says, |it rebukes my own indifference; but when I see a
          professed Christian just as indifferent about the salvation of men as
          I am, why, then I say, it is all a farce, nonsense! they don't mean
          it, the minister does not care a bit about whether souls are saved or
          not, and as for the church, they make a great, deaf of noise every now
          and then at Exeter Hall, about saving some poor blacks far away, but
          they don't care about saving us.| And so a worldling wraps himself up,
          and goes on his way in his sin and his iniquity, and perseveres, even
          to the last declaring all the while that religion is but a sham,
          because he sees us careless in solemn matters, and cold concerning
          everlasting realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have, mournfully in my own soul, set forth the plan whereby
          Satan comforts sinners in their sins, even by means of those who ought
          most sternly to rebuke them.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now for the second point -- THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS EVIL. And
          here I wish to speak very pointedly and personally to all of you who
          are professors of religion, and I do hope that you will take every
          point to yourself, in which you must feel that you have been and are
          guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends, how often have you and I, in the first place, helped to keep
          sinners easy in their sin, by our inconsistency! Had we been true
          Christians, the wicked man would often have been pricked to the heart,
          and his conscience would have convicted him; but having been
          unfaithful and untrue, he has been able to sleep on quietly, without
          any disturbance from us. Do you not think, my dear brothers and
          sisters, that you have each been guilty here? -- that you have often
          helped to pacify the wicked in their rebellion against God? I must
          confess myself that I am guilty. I have labored to escape from the
          sin, but I am not clean delivered from it. I pray each one of you,
          make a full confession before God, if by your silence, when sin has
          been committed before your eyes, or by a smile, when a lascivious joke
          has been told in your hearing, or if by a constant indifference to the
          cause of Christ you have led sinners to sleep more securely in the bed
          of their iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to go further still. Do you not think that very often, when a
          sinner's conscience has been roused, you and I have helped to give it
          a soporific draught by our coldness of heart, |Hush! Master
          Conscience,| says the sinner, but he will not be still, but cries
          aloud, |Repent, repent.| And then you, a professing Christian pass
          try, and you administer the laudanum draught of your indifference and
          the sinner's conscience falls back again into its slumber, and the
          reproof that might have been useful is entirely lost upon him. I am
          sure that this is one of the great crying sins of the church, that we
          are not now the witnesses of God, as we should be, but often quiet the
          witness of conscience in the souls of men. Look now to your lives -- I
          am speaking personally to each one -- look at yesterday, and the days
          that went before, and I ask you, and I solemnly charge you to answer
          that question, Have you not often assisted, in the first place, to
          keep men's consciences quiet, and afterwards to send them to sleep
          when they have been aroused?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further; is it not possible that often sinners have been strengthened
          in their sin by you? They were but beginning in iniquity, and had you
          rebuked with honesty and sincerity, by your own holy life, they might
          have been led to see their folly and might have ceased from sin; but
          you have strengthened their hands. They have gone forward confidently,
          because they have said, |See, a church member leads the way.|
          |So-and-so is not more scrupulous than I,| says such an one; |I may do
          what he does| And so you have helped to strengthen sinners in their
          sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, is it not possible that some of you Christians have helped to
          confirm men in their sins and to destroy their souls? It is a
          master-piece of thy devil, when he can use Christ's own soldiers
          against Christ. But this he has often done. I have known many a case.
          Let me tell a story of a minister -- one which I believe to be true
          and which convicts myself, and therefore I tell it with the hope that
          it may also waken your consciences and convict you too. There was a
          young minister once preaching very earnestly in a certain chapel, and
          he had to walk some four or five miles to his home along a country
          road after service. A young man, who had been deeply impressed under
          the sermon, requested the privilege of walking with the minister, with
          an earnest hope that he might get an opportunity of telling out his
          feelings to him, and obtaining some word of guidance or comfort.
          Instead of that, the young minister all the way along told the most
          singular tales to those who were with him, causing loud roars of
          laughter, and even relating tales which bordered upon the indecorous.
          He stopped at a certain house, and this young man with him, and the
          whole evening was spent in frivolity and foolish talking. Some years
          after, when the minister had grown old, he was sent for to the bedside
          of a dying man. He hastened thither with a heart desirous to do good.
          He was requested to sit down at the bedside and the dying man, looking
          at him, and regarding him most closely, said to him, |Do you remember
          preaching in such-and-such a village on such an occasion?| |I do,|
          said the minister. |I was one of your hearers,| said the man, |and I
          was deeply impressed by the sermon.| |Thank God for that,| said the
          minister. |Stop!| said the man, |don't thank God till you have heard
          the whole story; you will have reason to alter your tone before I have
          done.| The minister changed countenance, but he little guessed what
          would be the full extent of that man's testimony. Said he, |Sir, do
          you remember, after you had finished that earnest sermon, I with some
          others walked home with you? I was sincerely desirous of being led in
          the right path that night; but I heard you speak in such a strain of
          levity, and with so much coarseness too, that I went outside the
          house, while you were sitting down to your evening meal; l stamped my
          foot upon the ground; I said that you were a liar, that Christianity
          was a falsehood, that it you could pretend to be so in earnest about
          it in the pulpit, and then come down and talk like that, the whole
          thing must be a sham; and I have been an infidel,| said he, |a
          confirmed infidel, from that day to this. But I am not an infidel at
          this moment. I know better; I am dying, and I am about to be damned;
          and at the bar of God I will lay my damnation to your charge; my blood
          is one your head;| -- and with a dreadful shriek, and one demoniacal
          glance at the trembling minister, he shut his eyes and died. Is it not
          possible that we may have been guilty thus? The bare idea would make
          the flesh creep on our bones; and yet I think there are few among us
          who must not say, |That has been my fault, after all.| But are there
          not enough traps, in which to catch souls, without your being made
          Satan's fowlers to do misehief? Hath not Satan legions enough of
          devils to murder men, without employing you? Are there no hands that
          may be red with the blood of souls beside yours? O followers of
          Christ! O believers in Jesus! Will ye serve under the black prince?
          Will ye fight against your Master? Will ye drag sinners down to hell?
          Shall we -- (I take myself in here, more truly than any of you) --
          shall we, who profess to preach the gospel of Christ, by our
          conversation injure and destroy men's souls?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thus I think I have expounded the solemn consequences of this
          fearful evil. And now I come, in conclusion, and I pray God to help
          me, while I deal earnestly, and solemnly with you, AND BRING OUT THIS
          GREAT BATTERING RAM, TO BEAR AGAINST THIS VAIN EXCCUSE OF THE WICKED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among this great congregation, I have doubtless a very large number of
          persons who are not converted to God, and who have continually made
          this their excuse, |I see so much of the inconsistency of professors
          that I do not intend to think about religion myself.| My hearer, I
          conjure thee by the living God, give me thine ear a moment, while I
          pull this vain excuse of thine to pieces. What hast thou to do with
          the inconsistencies of another? |To his own master he shall stand or
          fall.| What will it better thee, if one half of all the professors of
          religions be sent to hell? What comfort will that be to thee, when
          thou shalt come there thyself? Man, will God require the sins of other
          people at thine hands? Where is it said that God will punish thee for
          what another does? Or dost thou imagine that God will reward thee
          because another is guilty? Thou art surely not foolish enough for
          that. I ask thee, what canst thou have to do with another's servant?
          That man is a servant of God, or at least professes to be; if he be
          not so, what busines can it possibly be of thine? If thou shouldst see
          twenty men drinking poison, would that be a reason why thou shouldst
          drink it? If, passing over London Bridge, thou shouldst see a dozen
          miserable creatures leaping off the parapet, there would be a good
          argument why thou thyself shouldst seek to stop them, but no argument
          why thou shouldst leap too. What if there be hundreds of suicides?
          will that excuse thee, if thou shalt shed thine own blood? Do men
          plead thus in courts of law? Does a man say, |O Judge, excuse me for
          having been a thief, there are so many hundreds of men that profess to
          be honest that are as big thieves as I?| Thou wilt be punished for
          thine own offenses, remember not for the offenses of another. Man! I
          conjure thee, look this in the face. How can this help to assuage thy
          misery? How can this help to make thee happier in hell, because thou
          sayest there are so many hypocrites in this world?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, besides, thou knowest well enough that the church is not so bad
          as thou sayest it is. Thou seest some that are inconsistent; but are
          there not many that are holy? Dost thou dare to say there are none? I
          tell thee, man, thou art a fool. There are many bad coins in the
          world, many counterfeits; do you, therefore, say there are no good
          ones? If you say so, you are mad; for the very fact that there are
          counterfeits is a proof that there must be realities. Would any man
          think it worth his while to make bad sovereigns if there were no good
          ones? It is just the quantity of good ones that passes off the few
          false coins. And so no man would pretend to be a Christian unless
          there were some good Christians. There would be no hypocrites if there
          were not some true men. It is the quantity of true, men that helps to
          pass off the hypocrite in the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then again, I say, when thou comest before the bar of God, dost
          thou think that this will serve thee as an excuse, to begin to find
          fault with God's own children? Suppose you were brought before a king,
          an absolute monarch, and you should begin to say, by way of appeal, |O
          king, I have been guilty, it is true, but your own sons and daughters
          I do not like; there are a great many faults in the princes of the
          blood.| Would he not say, |Wretch! thou art adding insult to
          wickedness; thou art guilty thyself, and now thou dost malign mine own
          children, the princes of the blood?| The Lord will not have thee say
          that at last. He has pardoned his children; he is ready to pardon
          thee. He sends mercy to thee this day, but if thou reject it, imagine
          not that thou shalt escape by recounting the sins of the pardoned
          ones. The rather this shall be an addition to thy sin, and thou shalt
          perish the more fearfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          But come, man, once again: I would entreat of thee with all my might.
          What! canst thou be so foolish as to imagine, that because another man
          is destroying his own soul by hypocrisy, that this is a reason why
          thou shouldet destroy thine by indifference? If there be thousands of
          untrue Christians, so much the more reason why I should be a true one:
          if there are hundreds of hypocrites, this should make me more earnest
          to search myself, and should not make me indifferent about the matter.
          O sinner! thou wilt soon be on thy dying bed, and will it comfort thee
          there to think, |I have rejected Christ, I have despised salvation, I
          am perishing in my sins,| and to add, |But there are many Christians
          who are hypocrites!| No, death will tear away that excuse. That will
          not serve you. And when the heavers are in a blaze, when the pillars
          of the earth shall reel, when God shall came on flying clouds to judge
          the children of men, when the eternal eyes are fixed upon you, and
          like burning lamps are enlightning the secret parts of your belly,
          will you then be able to make this an excuse -- |Good God! it is
          true,I have damned myself, it is true, I have wilfully transgressed;
          but there were many hypocrites?| Then shall the Judge say, |What hast
          thou to do with that? Thou hadst nought to do, to interfere with my
          kingdom and with my judgeship; for thine own offenses thou art lost;
          for thine own rejection of Christ thou shalt perish everlastingly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I conclude, by addressing the people of God with equal
          solemnity and earnestness.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, if I could weep tears of blood this morning, I could
          not show too much emotion concerning this most solemn point. I do not
          know that this text ever struck me before yesterday, but I no sooner
          noticed it than it came home to me as an accusation. I plead guilty to
          it, and I pray for forgiveness. I only wish that a like power may
          attend it to you, that you may feel that you have been guilty too. O
          friends, can you bear the thought that you may have helped to drag
          others down to hell? Christ has loved you and pardoned your sins; and
          will you push others downward? And yet if you are inconsistent, and
          especially if you are cold and lukewarm in your religion, you are
          doing it. |Well,| says one, |I don't do much good, but I do no hurt.|
          That is an impossibility. You must be either doing good or evil. There
          is no borderland between truth and sin; a men must be either on land
          or in the water; and you are either serving God or serving Satan; each
          day you are increasing your Master's kingdom, or else diminishing it.
          I cannot bear the thought that any of you should be employed in
          Satan's camp. Suppose there ever should be an invasion of this country
          by France. The tocsin rings from every church steeple, the drum is
          sounding in every street, and men are gathering at every market-cross.
          Peaceful men spring up to soldiers in an instant; and multitudes are
          marching away to the coast. When we come near it we behold a troop of
          soldiers who have climbed our white cliffs, and with bayonets fixed
          they are marching against us. We, with a tremendous cheer, rush on
          against them, to drive them back into the sea which girds our beloved
          country. Suddenly, as we rush forward, we detect scores of Englishmen
          marching in the same ranks with our foes, and seeking to ravage their
          own country. What should we say? Seize these traitors; let not one of
          them escape; put them all to death. Can Englishmen take the side of
          England's enemies? Can they march against our hearths and homes,
          betray their fatherland, and take the side of the tyrant Emperor? Can
          this be? Then let them die the death!| And yet this day I behold a
          more mournful spectacle yet. There is King Jesus marching at the head
          of his troops; and can it be that some of you, who profess to be his
          followers, are on the other side; that professing to be Christ's you
          are lighting in the ranks of the enemy -- carrying the baggage of
          Satan and wearing the uniform of hell, when you profess to be soldiers
          of Christ? I know there are such here: God forgive them! God spare
          them; and may the deserters yet come back, even though they come back
          in the chains of conviction! May they come back and be saved! O
          brethren and sisters, there are enough to destroy souls without us --
          enough to extend the kingdom of Satan without our helping him. |Come
          out from among them; touch not the unclean thing; be ye separate.|
          Church of God! awake, awake, awake to the salvation of men! Sleep no
          longer, begin to pray, to wrestle, to travail in birth; be more holy,
          more consistent, more strict, more solemn in thy deportment! Begin, O
          soldiers of Christ, to be more true to your colors, and as surely as
          the time shall come when the church shall thus be reformed and
          revived, to surely shall the King come into our midst, and we shall
          march on to certain victory, trampling down our enemies, and getting
          to our King many crowns, through many victories achieved.<br />
