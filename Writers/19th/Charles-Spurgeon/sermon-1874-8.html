        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1191)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, September 6th, 1874, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|Christ died for the ungodly.| -- Romans 5:6.</p>
        <p>
          In this verse the human race is described as a sick man, whose disease
          is so far advanced that he is altogether without strength: no power
          remains in his system to throw off his mortal malady, nor does he
          desire to do so; he could not save himself from his disease if he
          would, and would not if he could. I have no doubt that the apostle had
          in his eye the description of the helpless infant given by the prophet
          Ezekiel; it was an infant -- an infant newly born -- an infant
          deserted by its mother before the necessary offices of tenderness had
          been performed; left unwashed, unclothed, unfed, a prey to certain
          death under the most painful circumstances, forlorn, abandoned,
          hopeless. Our race is like the nation of Israel, its whole head is
          sick, and its whole heart faint. Such, unconverted men, are you! Only
          there is this darker shade in your picture, that your condition is not
          only your calamity, but your fault. In other diseases men are grieved
          at their sickness, but this is the worst feature in your case, that
          you love the evil which is destroying you. In addition to the pity
          which your case demands, no little blame must be measured out to you:
          you are without will for that which is good, your |cannot| means |will
          not,| your inability is not physical but moral, not that of the blind
          who cannot see for want of eyes, but of the willingly ignorant who
          refuse to look.
        </p>
        <p>
          While man is in this condition Jesus interposes for his salvation.
          |When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
          ungodly|; |while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,| according
          to |his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in
          trespasses and sins.| The pith of my sermon will be an endeavour to
          declare that the reason of Christ's dying for us did not lie in our
          excellence; but where sin abounded grace did much more abound, for the
          persons for whom Jesus died were viewed by him as the reverse of good,
          and he came into the world to save those who are guilty before God,
          or, in the words of our text, |Christ died for the ungodly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now to our business. We shall dwell first upon the fact -- |Christ
          died for the ungodly|; then we shall consider the fair inferences
          therefrom; and, thirdly, proceed to think and speak of the
          proclamation of this simple but wondrous truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, here is THE FACT -- |Christ died for the ungodly.| Never did
          the human ear listen to a more astounding and yet cheering truth.
          Angels desire to look into it, and if men were wise they would ponder
          it night and day. Jesus, the Son of God, himself God over all, the
          infinitely glorious One, Creator of heaven and earth, out of love to
          me stooped to become a man and die. Christ, the thrice holy God, the
          pure-hearted man, in whom there was no sin and could be none, espoused
          the cause of the wicked. Jesus, whose doctrine makes deadly war on
          sin, whose Spirit is the destroyer of evil, whose whole self abhors
          iniquity, whose second advent will prove his indignation against
          transgression, yet undertook the cause of the impious, and even unto
          death pursued their salvation. The Christ of God, though he had no
          part or lot in the fall and the sin which has arisen out of it, has
          died to redeem us from its penalty, and, like the psalmist, he can
          cry, |Then I restored that which I took not away.| Let all holy beings
          judge whether this is not the miracle of miracles!
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ, the name given to our Lord, is an expressive word; it means
          |Anointed One,| and indicates that he was sent upon a divine errand,
          commissioned by supreme authority. The Lord Jehovah said of old, |I
          have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out
          of the people|; and again, |I have given him as a covenant to the
          people, a leader and commander to the people.| Jesus was both set
          apart to this work, and qualified for it by the anointing of the Holy
          Ghost. He is no unauthorised saviour, no amateur deliverer, but an
          ambassador clothed with unbounded power from the great King, a
          Redeemer with full credentials from the Father. It is this ordained
          and appointed Saviour who has |died for the ungodly.| Remember this,
          ye ungodly! Consider well who it was that came to lay down his life
          for such as you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text says Christ died. He did a great deal besides dying, but the
          crowning act of his career of love for the ungodly, and that which
          rendered all the rest available to them, was his death for them. He
          actually gave up the ghost, not in fiction, but in fact. He laid down
          his life for us, breathing out his soul, even as other men do when
          they expire. That it might be indisputably clear that he was really
          dead, his heart was pierced with the soldier's spear, and forthwith
          came there out blood and water. The Roman governor would not have
          allowed the body to be removed from the cross had he not been duly
          certified that Jesus was indeed dead. His relatives and friends who
          wrapped him in linen and laid him in Joseph's tomb, were sorrowfully
          sure that all that lay before them was a corpse. The Christ really
          died, and in saying that, we mean that he suffered all the pangs
          incident to death; only he endured much more and worse, for his was a
          death of peculiar pain and shame, and was not only attended by the
          forsaking of man, but by the departure of his God. That cry, |My God,
          my God! why hast thou forsaken me?| was the innermost blackness of the
          thick darkness of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's death was penal, inflicted upon him by divine justice; and
          rightly so, for on him lay our iniquities, and therefore on him must
          lay the suffering. |It pleased the Father to bruise him; he hath put
          him to grief.| He died under circumstances which made his death most
          terrible. Condemned to a felon's gibbet, he was crucified amid a mob
          of jesters, with few sympathising eyes to gaze upon him; he bore the
          gaze of malice and the glance of scorn; he was hooted and jeered by a
          ribald throng, who were cruelly inventive in their taunts and
          blasphemies. There he hung, bleeding from many wounds, exposed to the
          sun, burning with fever, and devoured with thirst, under every
          circumstance of contumely, pain, and utter wretchedness; his death was
          of all deaths the most deadly death, and emphatically |Christ died.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But the pith of the text comes here, that |Christ died for the
          ungodly|; not for the righteous, not for the reverent and devout, but
          for the ungodly. Look at the original word, and you will find that it
          has the meaning of |impious, irreligious, and wicked.| Our translation
          is by no means too strong, but scarcely expressive enough. To be
          ungodly, or godless, is to be in a dreadful state, but as use has
          softened the expression, perhaps you will see the sense more clearly
          if I read it, |Christ died for the impious,| for those who have no
          reverence for God. Christ died for the godless, who, having cast off
          God, cast off with him all love for that which is right. I do not know
          a word that could more fitly describe the most irreligious of mankind
          than the original word in this place, and I believe it is used on
          purpose by the Spirit of God to convey to us the truth, which we are
          always slow to receive, that Christ did not die because men were good,
          or would be good, but died for them as ungodly -- or, in other words,
          |he came to seek and to save that which was lost.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, then, that when the Son of God determined to die for men, he
          viewed them as ungodly, and far from God by wicked works. In casting
          his eye over our race he did not say, |Here and there I see spirits of
          nobler mould, pure, truthful, truth-seeking, brave, disinterested, and
          just; and therefore, because of these choice ones, I will die for this
          fallen race.| No; but looking on them all, he whose judgment is
          infallible returned this verdict, |They are all gone out of the way;
          they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good,
          no, not one.| Putting them down at that estimate, and nothing better,
          Christ died for them. He did not please himself with some rosy dream
          of a superior race yet to come, when the age of iron should give place
          to the age of gold, -- some halcyon period of human development, in
          which civilisation would banish crime, and wisdom would conduct man
          back to God. Full well he knew that, left to itself, the world would
          grow worse and worse, and that by its very wisdom it would darken its
          own eyes. It was not because a golden age would come by natural
          progress, but just because such a thing was impossible, unless he died
          to procure it, that Jesus died for a race which, apart from him, could
          only develop into deeper damnation. Jesus viewed us as we really were,
          not as our pride fancies us to be; he saw us to be without God,
          enemies of our own Creator, dead in trespasses and sins, corrupt, and
          set on mischief, and even in our occasional cry for good, searching
          for it with blinded judgment and prejudiced heart, so that we put
          bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. He saw that in us was no good
          thing, but every possible evil, so that we were lost, -- utterly,
          helplessly, hopelessly lost apart from him: yet viewing us as in that
          graceless and Godless plight and condition, he died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have you remember that the view under which Jesus beheld us
          was not only the true one, but, for us, the kindly one; because had it
          been written that Christ died for the better sort, then each troubled
          spirit would have inferred |he died not for me.| Had the merit of his
          death been the perquisite of honesty, where would have been the dying
          thief? If of chastity, where the woman that loved much? If of
          courageous fidelity, how would it have fared with the apostles, for
          they all forsook him and fled? There are times when the bravest man
          trembles lest he should be found a coward, the most disinterested
          frets about the selfishness of his heart, and the most pure is
          staggered by his own impurity; where, then, would have been hope for
          one of us, if the gospel had been only another form of law, and the
          benefits of the cross had been reserved as the rewards of virtue? The
          gospel does not come to us as a premium for virtue, but it presents us
          with forgiveness for sin. It is not a reward for health, but a
          medicine for sickness. Therefore, to meet all cases, it puts us down
          at our worst, and, like the good Samaritan with the wounded traveller,
          it comes to us where we are. |Christ died for the impious| is a great
          net which takes in even the leviathan sinner; and of all the creeping
          sinners innumerable which swarm the sea of sin, there is not one kind
          which this great net does not encompass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us note well that in this condition lay the need of our race that
          Christ should die. I do not see how it could have been written |Christ
          died for the good.| To what end for the good? Why need they his death?
          If men are perfect, does God need to be reconciled to them? Was he
          ever opposed to holy beings? Impossible! On the other hand, were the
          good ever the enemies of God? If such there be are they not of
          necessity his friends? If man be by nature just with God, to what end
          should the Saviour die? |The just for the unjust| I can understand;
          but the |just dying for the just| were a double injustice -- an
          injustice that the just should be punished at all, and another
          injustice that the just should be punished for them. Oh no! If Christ
          died, it must be because there was a penalty to be paid for sin
          committed, hence he must have died for those who had committed the
          sin. If Christ died, it must have been because |a fountain filled with
          blood| was necessary for the cleansing away of heinous stains; hence,
          it must have been for those who are defiled. Suppose there should be
          found anywhere in this world an unfallen man -- perfectly innocent of
          all actual sin, and free from any tendency to it, there would be a
          superfluity of cruelty in the crucifixion of the innocent Christ for
          such an individual. What need has he that Christ should die for him,
          when he has in his own innocence the right to live? If there be found
          beneath the copes of heaven an individual who, notwithstanding some
          former slips and flaws, can yet, by future diligence, completely
          justify himself before God, then it is clear that there is no need for
          Christ to die for him. I would not insult him by telling him that
          Christ died for him, for he would reply to me, |Why should he? Cannot
          I make myself just without him?| In the very nature of things it must
          be so, that if Christ Jesus dies he must die for the ungodly. Such
          agonies as his would not have been endured had there not been a cause,
          and what cause could there have been but sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have said that Jesus died as our example; but that is not
          altogether true. Christ's death is not absolutely an example for men,
          it was a march into a region of which he said, |Ye cannot follow me
          now.| His life was our example, but not his death in all respects, for
          we are by no means bound to surrender ourselves voluntarily to our
          enemies as he did, but when persecuted in one city we are bidden to
          flee to another. To be willing to die for the truth is a most Christly
          thing, and in that Jesus is our example; but into the winepress which
          he trod it is not ours to enter, the voluntary element which was
          peculiar to his death renders it inimitable. He said, |I lay down my
          life of myself; no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of
          myself.| One word of his would have delivered him from his foes; he
          had but to say |Begone!| and the Roman guards must have fled like
          chaff before the wind. He died because he willed to do so; of his own
          accord he yielded up his spirit to the Father. It must have been as an
          atonement for the guilty; it could not have been as an example, for no
          man is bound voluntarily to die. Both the dictates of nature, and the
          command of the law, require us to preserve our lives. |Thou shalt not
          kill| means |Thou shalt not voluntarily give up thine own life any
          more than take the life of another.| Jesus stood in a special
          position, and therefore he died; but his example would have been
          complete enough without his death, had it not been for the peculiar
          office which he had undertaken. We may fairly conclude that Christ
          died for men who needed such a death; and, as the good did not need it
          for an example -- and in fact it is not an example to them -- he must
          have died for the ungodly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sum of our text is this -- all the benefits resulting from the
          Redeemer's passion, and from all the works that followed upon it, are
          for those who by nature are ungodly. His gospel is that sinners
          believing in him are saved. His sacrifice has put away sin from all
          who trust him, and, therefore, it was offered for those who had sin
          upon them before. |He rose again for our justification,| but certainly
          not for the justification of those who can be justified by their own
          works. He ascended on high, and we are told that he |received gifts
          for men, yea, for the rebellious also.| He lives to intercede, and
          Isaiah tells us that |He made intercession for the transgressors.| The
          aim of his death, resurrection, ascension, and eternal life, is
          towards the sinful sons of men. His death has brought pardon, but it
          cannot be pardon for those who have no sin -- pardon is only for the
          guilty. He is exalted on high |to give repentance,| but surely not to
          give repentance to those who have never sinned, and have nothing to
          repent of. Repentance and remission both imply previous guilt in those
          who receive them: unless, then, these gifts of the exalted Saviour are
          mere shams and superfluities, they must be meant for the really
          guilty. From his side there flowed out water as well as blood -- the
          water is intended to cleanse polluted nature, then certainly not the
          nature of the sinless, but the nature of the impure; and so both blood
          and water flowed for sinners who need the double purification. To-day
          the Holy Spirit regenerates men as the result of the Redeemer's death;
          and who can be regenerated but those who need a new heart and a right
          spirit? To regenerate the already pure and innocent were ridiculous;
          regeneration is a work which creates life where there was formerly
          death, gives a heart of flesh to those whose hearts were originally
          stone, and implants the love of holiness where sin once had sole
          dominion. Conversion is also another gift, which comes through his
          death, but does he turn those whose faces are already in the right
          direction? It cannot be. He converts the sinner from the error of his
          ways, he turns the disobedient into the right way, he leads back the
          stray sheep to the fold. Adoption is another gift which comes to us by
          the cross. Does the Lord adopt those who are already his sons by
          nature? If children already, what room is there for adoption? No; but
          the grand act of divine love is that which takes those who are
          |children of wrath even as others,| and by sovereign grace puts them
          among the children, and makes them |heirs of God, joint heirs with
          Jesus Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          To-day I see the Good Shepherd in all the energy of his mighty love,
          going forth into the dreadful wilderness. For whom is he gone forth?
          For the ninety and nine who feed at home? No, but into the desert his
          love sends him, over hill and dale, to seek the one lost sheep which
          has gone astray. Behold, I see him arousing his church, like a good
          housewife, to cleanse her house. With the besom of the law she sweeps,
          and with the candle of the word she searches, and what for? For those
          bright new coined pieces fresh from the mint, which glitter safely in
          her purse? Assuredly not, but for that lost piece which has rolled
          away into the dust, and lies hidden in the dark corner. And lo!
          grandest of all visions! I see the Eternal Father, himself, in the
          infinity of his love, going forth in haste to meet a returning child.
          And whom does he go to meet? The elder brother returning from the
          field, bringing his sheaves with him? An Esau, who has brought him
          savoury meat such as his soul loveth? A Joseph whose godly life has
          made him lord over all Egypt? Nay, the Father leaves his home to meet
          a returning prodigal, who has companied with harlots, and grovelled
          among swine, who comes back to him in disgraceful rags, and disgusting
          filthiness! It is on a sinner's neck that the Father weeps; it is on a
          guilty cheek that he sets his kisses; it is for an unworthy one that
          the fatted calf is killed, and the best robe is worn, and the house is
          made merry with music and with dancing. Yes, tell it, and let it ring
          round earth and heaven, Christ died for the ungodly. Mercy seeks the
          guilty, grace has to do with the impious, the irreligious and the
          wicked. The physician has not come to heal the healthy, but to heal
          the sick. The great philanthropist has not come to bless the rich and
          the great, but the captive and the prisoner. He puts down the mighty
          from their seats, for he is a stern leveller, but he has come to lift
          the beggar from the dunghill, and to set him among princes, even the
          princes of his people. Sing ye, then, with the holy Virgin, and let
          your song be loud and sweet, -- |He hath filled the hungry with good
          things, but the rich he hath sent empty away.| |This is a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the
          world to save sinners.| |He is able to save to the uttermost them that
          come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
          them.| O ye guilty ones, believe in him and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us now consider THE PLAIN INFERENCES FROM THIS FACT. Let me
          have your hearts as well as your ears, especially those of you who are
          not yet saved, for I desire you to be blessed by the truths uttered;
          and oh, may the Spirit of God cause it to be so. It is clear that
          those of you who are ungodly -- and if you are unconverted you are
          that -- are in great danger. Jesus would not interpose his life and
          bear the bloody sweat and crown of thorns, and nails, and spear, and
          scorn unmitigated, and death itself, if there were not solemn need and
          imminent peril. There is danger, solemn danger, for you. You are under
          the wrath of God already, and you will soon die, and then, as surely
          as you live, you will be lost, and lost forever; as certain as the
          righteous will enter into everlasting life, you will be driven into
          everlasting punishment. The cross is the danger signal to you, it
          warns you that if God spared not his only Son, he will not spare you.
          It is the lighthouse set on the rocks of sin to warn you that swift
          and sure destruction awaits you if you continue to rebel against the
          Lord. Hell is an awful place, or Jesus had not needed to suffer such
          infinite agonies to save us from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also fairly to be inferred that out of this danger only Christ
          can deliver the ungodly, and he only through his death. If a less
          price than that of the life of the Son of God could have redeemed men,
          he would have been spared. When a country is at war, and you see a
          mother give up her only boy to fight her country's battles -- her only
          well-beloved, blameless son -- you know that the battle must be raging
          very fiercely, and that the country is in stern danger: for, if she
          could find a substitute for him, though she gave all her wealth, she
          would lavish it freely to spare her darling. If she were certain that
          in his heart a bullet would find its target, she must have strong love
          for her country, and her country must be in dire necessity ere she
          would bid him go. If, then, |God spared not his Son, but freely
          delivered him up for us all,| there must have been a dread necessity
          for it. It must have stood thus: die he, or the sinner must, or
          justice must; and since justice could not, and the Father desired that
          the sinner should not, then Christ must; and so he did. Oh, miracle of
          love! I tell you, sinners, you cannot help yourselves, nor can all the
          priests of Rome or Oxford help you, let them perform their antics as
          they may; Jesus alone can save, and that only by his death. There on
          the bloody tree hangs all man's hope; if you enter heaven it must be
          by force of the incarnate God's bleeding out his life for you. You are
          in such peril that only the pierced hand can lift you out of it. Look
          to him, at once, I pray you, ere the proud waters go over your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let it be noticed -- and this is the point I want constantly to
          keep before your view -- that Jesus died out of pure pity. He must
          have died out of the most gratuitous benevolence to the undeserving,
          because the character of those for whom he died could not have
          attracted him, but must have been repulsive to his holy soul. The
          impious, the godless -- can Christ love these for their character? No,
          he loved them notwithstanding their offences, loved them as creatures
          fallen and miserable, loved them according to the multitude of his
          loving-kindnesses and tender mercies, from pity, and not from
          admiration. Viewing them as ungodly, yet he loved them. This is
          extraordinary love! I do not wonder that some persons are loved by
          others, for they wear a potent charm in their countenances, their ways
          are winsome, and their characters charm you into affection; |but God
          commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners
          Christ died for us.| He looked at us, and there was not a solitary
          beauty spot upon us: we were covered with |wounds, and bruises, and
          putrefying sores,| distortions, defilements, and pollutions; and yet,
          for all that, Jesus loved us. He loved us because he would love us;
          because his heart was full of pity, and he could not let us perish.
          Pity moved him to seek the most needy objects that his love might
          display its utmost ability in lifting men from the lowest degradation,
          and putting them in the highest position of holiness and honour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe another inference. If Christ died for the ungodly, this fact
          leaves the ungodly no excuse if they do not come to him, and believe
          in him unto salvation. Had it been otherwise they might have pleaded,
          |We are not fit to come.| But you are ungodly, and Christ died for the
          ungodly, why not for you? I hear the reply, |But I have been so very
          vile.| Yes, you have been impious, but your sin is not worse than this
          word ungodly will compass. Christ died for those who were wicked,
          thoroughly wicked. The Greek word is so expressive that it must take
          in your case, however wrongly you have acted. |But I cannot believe
          that Christ died for such as I am,| says one. Then, sir, mark! I hold
          you to your words, and charge you with contradicting the Eternal God
          to his teeth, and making him a liar. Your statement gives God the lie.
          The Lord declares that |Christ died for the ungodly,| and you say he
          did not, what is that but to make God a liar? How can you expect mercy
          if you persist in such proud unbelief? Believe the divine revelation.
          Close in at once with the gospel. Forsake your sins and believe in the
          Lord Jesus, and you shall surely live. The fact that Christ died for
          the ungodly renders self-righteousness a folly. Why need a man pretend
          that he is good if |Christ died for the ungodly?| We have an
          orphanage, and the qualification for our orphanage is that the child
          for whom admission is sought shall be utterly destitute. I will
          suppose a widow trying to show to me and my fellow trustees that her
          boy is a fitting object for the charity; will she tell us that her
          child has a rich uncle? Will she enlarge upon her own capacities for
          earning a living? Why, this would be to argue against herself, and she
          is much too wise for that, I warrant you, for she knows that any such
          statements would damage rather than serve her cause. So, sinner, do
          not pretend to be righteous, do not dream that you are better than
          others, for that is to argue against yourself. Prove that you are not
          by nature ungodly, and you prove yourself to be one for whom Jesus did
          not die. Jesus comes to make the ungodly godly, and the sinful holy,
          but the raw material upon which he works is described in the text not
          by its goodness but by its badness; it is for the ungodly that Jesus
          died. |Oh, but if I felt!| Felt what? Felt something which would make
          you better? Then you would not so clearly come under the description
          here given. If you are destitute of good feelings, and thoughts, and
          hopes, and emotions, you are ungodly, and |Christ died for the
          ungodly.| Believe in him and you shall be saved from that ungodliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Well,| cries out some Pharisaic moralist, |this is dangerous
          doctrine.| How so? Would it be dangerous doctrine to say that
          physicians exercise their skill to cure sick people and not healthy
          ones? Would that encourage sickness? Would that discourage health? You
          know better; you know that to inform the sick of a physician who can
          heal them is one of the best means for promoting their cure. If
          ungodly and impious men would take heart and run to the Saviour, and
          by him become cured of impiety and ungodliness, would not that be a
          good thing? Jesus has come to make the ungodly godly, the impious
          pious, the wicked obedient, and the dishonest upright. He has not come
          to save them in their sins, but from their sins; and this is the best
          of news for those who are diseased with sin. Self-righteousness is a
          folly, and despair is a crime, since Christ died for the ungodly. None
          are excluded hence but those who do themselves exclude; this great
          gate is set so wide open that the very worst of men may enter, and
          you, dear hearer, may enter now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is also very evident from our text that when they are
          saved, the converted find no ground of boasting; for when their hearts
          are renewed and made to love God they cannot say, |See how good I am,|
          because they were not so by nature; they were ungodly, and, as such,
          Christ died for them. Whatever goodness there may be in them after
          conversion they ascribe it to the grace of God, since by nature they
          were alienated from God, and far removed from righteousness. If the
          truth of natural depravity be but known and felt, free grace must be
          believed in, and then all glorying is at an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will also keep the saved ones from thinking lightly of sin. If
          God had forgiven sinners without an atonement they might have thought
          little of transgression, but now that pardon comes to them through the
          bitter griefs of their Redeemer they cannot but see it to be an
          exceeding great evil. When we look to Jesus dying on the cross we end
          our dalliance with sin, and utterly abhor the cause of so great
          suffering to so dear a Saviour. Every wound of Jesus is an argument
          against sin. We never know the full evil of our iniquities till we see
          what it cost the Redeemer to put them away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation by the death of Christ is the strongest conceivable promoter
          of all the things which are pure, honest, lovely, and of good report.
          It makes sin so loathsome that the saved one cannot take up even its
          name without dread. |I will take away the name of Baalim out of thy
          mouth.| He looks upon it as we should regard a knife rusted with gore,
          wherewith some villain had killed our mother, our wife, or child.
          Could we play with it? Could we bear it about our persons or endure it
          in our sight? No, accursed thing! stained with the heart's blood of my
          beloved, I would fain fling thee into the bottomless abyss! Sin is
          that dagger which stabbed the Saviour's heart, and henceforth it must
          be the abomination of every man who has been redeemed by the atoning
          sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          To close this point. Christ's death for the ungodly is the grandest
          argument to make the ungodly love him when they are saved. To love
          Christ is the mainspring of obedience in men -- how shall men be led
          to love him? If you would grow love, you must sow love. Go, then; and
          let men know the love of Christ to sinners, and they will, by grace,
          be moved to love him in return. No doubt all of us require to know the
          threatenings of the wrath of God; but that which soonest touches my
          heart is Christ's free love to an unworthy one like myself. When my
          sins seem blackest to me, and yet I know that through Christ's death I
          am forgiven, this blest assurance melts me down.
        </p>
        <p>|If thou hadst bid thy thunders roll,</p>
        <p>And lightnings flash, to blast my soul.</p>
        <p>I still had stubborn been;</p>
        <p>But mercy has my heart subdued,</p>
        <p>A bleeding Saviour I have view'd,</p>
        <p>And now I hate my sin.|</p>
        <p>
          I have heard of a soldier who had been put in prison for drunkenness
          and insubordination several times and he had been also flogged, but
          nothing improved him. At last he was taken in the commission of
          another offence, and brought before the commanding officer, who said
          to him, |My man, I have tried everything in the martial code with you,
          except shooting you; you have been imprisoned and whipped, but nothing
          has changed you. I am determined to try something else with you. You
          have caused us a great deal of trouble and anxiety, and you seem
          resolved to do so still; I shall, therefore, change my plans with you,
          and I shall neither fine you, flog you, nor imprison you; I will see
          what kindness will do, and therefore I fully and freely forgive you.|
          The man burst into tears, for he reckoned on a round number of lashes,
          and had steeled himself to bear them, but when he found he was to be
          forgiven, and set free, he said, |Sir, you shall not have to find
          fault with me again.| Mercy won his heart. Now, sinner, in that
          fashion God is dealing with you. Great sinners! Ungodly sinners! God
          says, |My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your
          ways. I have threatened you, and you hardened your hearts against me.
          Therefore, come now, and let us reason together: though your sins be
          as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
          crimson, they shall be as wool.| |Well,| says one, |I am afraid if you
          talk to sinners so they will go and sin more and more.| Yes, there are
          brutes everywhere, who can be so unnatural as to sin because grace
          abounds, but I bless God there is such a thing as the influence of
          love, and I am rejoiced that many feel the force of it, and yield to
          the conquering arms of amazing grace. The Spirit of God wins the day
          by such arguments as these; love is the great battering-ram which
          opens gates of brass. When the Lord says, |I have blotted out thy
          transgressions like a cloud, and like a thick cloud thine iniquities,|
          then the man is moved to repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can tell you hundreds and thousands of cases in which this infinite
          love has done all the good that morality itself could ask to have
          done; it has changed the heart and turned the entire current of the
          man's nature from sin to righteousness. The sinner has believed,
          repented, turned from his evil ways, and become zealous for holiness.
          Looking to Jesus he has felt his sin forgiven, and he has started up a
          new man, to lead a new life. God grant it may be so this morning, and
          he shall have all the glory of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. So now we must close -- and this is the last point -- THE
          PROCLAMATION OF THIS FACT, that |Christ died for the ungodly.| I would
          not mind if I were condemned to live fifty years more, and never to be
          allowed to speak but these five words, if I might be allowed to utter
          them in the ear of every man, and woman, and child who lives. |CHRIST
          DIED FOR THE UNGODLY| is the best message that even angels could bring
          to men. In the proclamation of this the whole church ought to take its
          share. Those of us who can address thousands should be diligent to cry
          aloud -- |Christ died for the ungodly|; but those of you who can speak
          to one, or write a letter to one, must keep on at this -- |Christ died
          for the ungodly.| Shout it out, or whisper it out; print it in
          capitals, or write it in a lady's hand -- |Christ died for the
          ungodly.| Speak it solemnly, it is not a thing for jest. Speak it
          joyfully; it is not a theme for sorrow, but for joy. Speak it firmly;
          it is indisputable fact. Facts of science, as they call them, are
          always questioned: this is unquestionable. Speak it earnestly; for if
          there be any truth which ought to arouse all a man's soul it is this:
          |Christ died for the ungodly.| Speak it where the ungodly live, and
          that is at your own house. Speak it also down in the dark corners of
          the city, in the haunts of debauchery, in the home of the thief, in
          the den to the depraved. Tell it in the gaol; and sit down at the
          dying bed and read in a tender whisper -- |Christ died for the
          ungodly.| When you pass the harlot in the street, do not give a toss
          with that proud head of yours, but remember that |Christ died for the
          ungodly|; and when you recollect those that injured you, say no bitter
          word, but hold your tongue, and remember |Christ died for the
          ungodly.| Make this henceforth the message of your life -- |Christ
          died for the ungodly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, oh, dear friends, you that are not saved, take care that you
          receive this message. Believe it. Go to God with this on your tongue
          -- |Lord save me, for Christ died for the ungodly, and I am of them.|
          Fling yourself right on to this as a man commits himself to his
          lifebelt amid the surging billows. |But I do not feel,| says one.
          Trust not your feelings if you do; but with no feelings and no hopes
          of your own, cling desperately to this, |Christ died for the ungodly.|
          The transforming, elevating, spiritualising, moralising, sanctifying
          power of this great fact you shall soon know and be no more ungodly;
          but first, as ungodly, rest you on this, |Christ died for the
          ungodly.| Accept this truth, my dear hearer, and you are saved. I do
          not mean merely that you will be pardoned, I do not mean that you will
          enter heaven, I mean much more; I mean that you will have a new heart;
          you will be saved from the love of sin, saved from drunkenness, saved
          from uncleanness, saved from blasphemy, saved from dishonesty. |Christ
          died for the ungodly| -- if that be really known and trusted in, it
          will open in your soul new springs of living water which will cleanse
          the Augean stable of your nature, and make a temple of God of that
          which was before a den of thieves. Trust in the mercy of God through
          the death of Jesus Christ, and a new era in your life's history will
          at once commence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having put this as plainly as I know how, and having guarded my speech
          to prevent there being anything like a flowery sentence in it, having
          tried to put this as clearly as daylight itself, -- that |Christ died
          for the ungodly,| if your ears refuse the precious boons that come
          through the dying Christ, your blood be on your own heads, for there
          is no other way of salvation for any one among you. Whether you reject
          or accept this, I am clear. But oh! do not reject it, for it is your
          life. If the Son of God dies for sinners, and sinners reject his
          blood, they have committed the most heinous offence possible. I will
          not venture to affirm, but I do suggest that the devils in hell are
          not capable of so great a stretch of criminality as is involved in the
          rejection of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Here lies the highest
          love. The incarnate God bleeds to death to save men, and men hate God
          so much that they will not even have him as he dies to save them. They
          will not be reconciled to their Creator, though he stoops from his
          loftiness to the depths of woe in the person of his Son on their
          behalf. This is depravity indeed, and desperateness of rebellion. God
          grant you may not be guilty of it. There can be no fiercer flame of
          wrath than that which will break forth from love that has been
          trampled upon, when men have put from them eternal life, and done
          despite to the Lamb of God. |Oh,| says one, |would God I could
          believe!| |Sir, what difficulty is there in it? Is it hard to believe
          the truth? Darest thou belie thy God? Art thou steeling thy heart to
          such desperateness that thou wilt call thy God a liar?| |No; I believe
          Christ died for the ungodly,| says one, |but I want to know how to get
          the merit of that death applied to my own soul.| Thou mayest, then,
          for here it is -- |He that believeth in him,| that is, he that trusts
          in him, |is not condemned.| Here is the gospel and the whole of it --
          |He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: he that believeth
          not shall be damned.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a poor weak man like yourselves, but my gospel is not weak; and
          it would be no stronger if one of |the mailed cherubim, or sworded
          seraphim| could take the platform and stand here instead of me. He
          could tell to you no better news. God, in condescension to your
          weakness, has chosen one of your fellow mortals to bear to you this
          message of infinite affection. Do not reject it! By your souls' value,
          by their immortality, by the hope of heaven and by the dread of hell,
          lay hold upon eternal life; and by the fear that this may be your last
          day on earth, yea, and this evening your last hour, I do beseech you
          now, |steal away to Jesus.| There is life in a look at the crucified
          one; there is life at this moment for you. Look to him now and live.
          Amen.
