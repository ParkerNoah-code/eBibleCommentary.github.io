          It may be worth while to state here, that I have uniformly (mistakes
          excepted) put my chronological statements, at the head of
          introductions, into brackets, so as to make the reader sure that the
          Edinburgh edition is not to be responsible for them. Some have
          inferred, therefore, that what follows is from the Edinburgh; but I
          think my modes of expression sufficient, generally, to guard against
          misconception. Notes (like this) are sometimes marked, |By the
          American Editor,| when I have feared a misleading ambiguity.
          Otherwise, I have been unguarded. All the introductions in these
          |Remains| are mine, save the prefatory paragraphs of the translator on
          pp.747, 748. Annotations on my own material are not bracketed. The
          very large amount of work bestowed upon this edition can only be known
          by comparison with the Edinburgh. In several instances of delicate
          criticism I have obtained valuable aid from my beloved friend, F. P.
          Nash, Esq., of Hobart College, especially in questions of the low
          Latin or ambiguous Greek.
