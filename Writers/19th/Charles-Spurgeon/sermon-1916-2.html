          |And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have
          brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up
          the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I, Jehovah,
          have spoken and have done it.| -- Ezekiel 17:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAN your minds fly back to the time when there was no time, to the day
          when there was no day but the Ancient of Days? Can you speed back to
          that period when God dwelt alone, when this round world and all the
          things that be upon it, had not come from his hand; when the sun
          flamed not in his strength, and the stars flashed not in their
          brightness? Can you go back to the period when there were no angels,
          when cherubim and seraphim had not been born; and, if there be
          creatures elder than they, when none of them had as yet been formed?
          Is it possible, I say, for you to fly so far back as to contemplate
          God alone -- no creature no breath of song, no motion of wing -- God
          himself alone, without another? Then, indeed, he had no rival; none
          then could contest with him, for none existed. All power, and glory,
          and honour and majesty were gathered up into Himself. And we have no
          reason to believe that he was less glorious than He is now, when his
          ministers delight to do his pleasure; nor less great than now, when he
          has crested worlds on worlds, and thrown them into space, scattering
          over the sky stars with both his hands. He sat on no precarious
          throne; he needed none to add to his power; he needed none to bring
          him a revenue of praise; his all-sufficiency could spirit of no lack.
          Consider next, if ye can, the eternal purpose of God that he would
          create. He determines it in his mind. Could any but a divine motive
          actuate the Divine Architect? What must that motive have been? He
          creates that he may display his own perfections. He does beget, as it
          were, creatures after his own image that he may live in them; that he
          may manifest to others the joy, the pleasure, the satisfaction, which
          he so intensely feels in himself. Certain 1 am his own glory must have
          been the end he had in view; he would reveal his glory to the sons of
          men, to angels, and to such creatures as he had formed, in order that
          they might reflect his honour and sing his praise. You are not
          ignorant, my brethren, of the fact that sin entered into the world.
          You know that the creation, which had been harmonious as a psalm in
          God's praise, voluminous and exhaustive as a book in which he revealed
          his own character -- this creation, once exceedingly fair, became
          foully marred. Rival instincts were produced, and rival Interests were
          set up. Man's will stood up against God's will; mar's profit against
          God's honour; man's device against God's counsel. Eve took of the
          accursed fruit, and Adam partook of the same, and henceforth man
          became a rival to God, just as Satan, aforetime, had rebelled against
          the blessed and only Potentate, and usurped authority. From the time
          when Satan fell, God's purpose was to break down everything which set
          itself up in opposition to him. From that day till now, no matter how
          great, how lofty, how apparently excellent a thing might be, it has
          been the rule with God to pull it down if it did not stand in him, and
          for him; yea, and wherever he has looked, no matter how mean a thing
          may have been, how low, how degraded to outward appearance, it has
          been God's constant rule to lift it up, if it stood in him, and for
          him. Or if, by the lifting up of the humble, he might throw scorn upon
          the haughty, he would thereby magnify his own absolute right to
          exercise sovereign control, and to do with men as he willed.
        </p>

          Oh! that I could command the words of some of the mighty masters of
          song, or that I had an angel's voice, so much rather would I hymn this
          high majestic theme than speak of it in listless prose. But I cannot
          rise to the awful heights of this incomparable design. I contemplate
          it with awe not unmingled with admiration -- the Eternal God
          withstanding everything that opposes itself against him -- thrusting
          down the mighty from their seats, plucking off crowns from the heads
          of princes, degrading the escutcheons of nobles, trampling in the mire
          the fine linen and the scarlet of the rich, setting at nought the
          wisdom of the wise, divesting the philosopher of his toga, rending in
          pieces the robes of the priest, end pouring contempt upon everything
          that vaunts pretension or arrogates prestige in defiance of his sacred
          prescriptive, irrevocable lordship. There is no power or permanence,
          no warrant or worth, in any claim to greatness or goodness independent
          of God, or antagonistic to him. My conceptions are too dwarfish, my
          language is too feeble, to compass the grandeur of this theme. It's
          truth commends it, and its usefulness enhances it: since it bows the
          heart before God. and convinces us that then only are we in a fit
          state to be filled with his fulness, to live in his life, to be wise
          with his wisdom, and to be glorious in his glory, when we are emptied
          of our own conceits. Mine, however, will be a more practical lesson at
          this time; and I shall use more homely words than that nobler subject
          might have demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
          METHINKs I see a great forest which reaches for many a league. The
          trees are of divers growths, and of various ages. Some of them are
          very lofty. Here a towering cedar and yonder the storks have made
          their nests among the tall fir trees. Stout oaks there are that laugh
          at storms, and elms that will not be twisted with the tempest. See how
          they rival each other! And there are lowlier trees; some bearing
          fruit, though scarcely seen; others, like the vine, creeping upon the
          ground -- so obscure they can hardly be observed. It is a strange
          forest in which trees of every clime are to be found; some green,
          verdant, lader with blossoms and with fruit; others dead, dry,
          withered, with scarce here and there a leaf. It is the evening, the
          cool of the day. The Lord God that visited the fair garden of Eden is
          come to walk in this forest. Along those deep glades, amidst that
          thick shade, the Almighty appears. He comes. How see I him? Bears he
          in his hand an awful axe, and cloth he pass his finger along its edge
          to see that it be keen? Strong is the arm that wields it. Howl,
          cedars, if once he life that axe against you. What means that Woodman
          to do? Wait, and let us hear him speak. Oh! ye trees of the field be
          silent before the Lord. Clap not your hands until we have heard him
          speak. |The trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought
          down the high tree -- beware, ye towering cedars! -- |that I have
          exalted the low tree| -- take courage, ye lowly vines! -- |have dried
          up the green tree| -- wail, ye verdant elms -- |and have made the dry
          tree to flourish|; -- hope, ye withered boughs! -- |I the Lord have
          spoken, and have done it.| Let the trees be silent before the Lord,
          for he cometh to judge them, and he judgeth them with much jealousy.
          That forest I have before my eyes; men like trees appear to me in the
          vision. While I gaze on this dense mass of people listening to my
          voice, let me interpret the Mighty Woodman's words to you. There are
          four notes of which we shall speak one after the other. May God
          sanctify the emblems to our profit, touching our ears, and teaching
          our hearts, that we may rightly understand what the Lord saith to the
          trees of the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. |THUS SAITH THE LORD, THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL KNOW THAT I THE
          LORD HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE HIGH TREE.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Look over history, and you will see that everything gigantic in
          stature and colossal in dimensions, whatsoever has been great to human
          apprehension, grasping at earthly fame, has become an object for God's
          penetrating arrows, and a subject for his withering blight. A grand
          idea of universal monarchy flashed upon the mind of man. He would
          build a tower, the top whereof should reach to heaven. What did the
          Lord do with this fine scheme? |I will come down,| said |to Babel, and
          see if it be altogether as they have said.| Then he touched their
          tongues, and confounded their language, and scattered the imaginations
          of their hearts: so he laughed them to scorn, and left them to be a
          laughingstock to all generations. Then came the great power of Egypt.
          Pharaoh said, |Am I not lord of Thebes, with its hundred gates, and
          with its myriads of brazen chariots? Have I not a mighty host of
          cavalry? Who is equal to me? I speak, and the nations tremble.| When
          the king hardened his heart, how did Jehovah -- the King of kings --
          get himself honour from Pharaoh and his hosts? |Thou didst blow with
          thy wind; the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty
          waters. Sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the
          horse and his rider bath he cast into the sea!| In after years Babylon
          set herself up as a queen. |I shall be a lady for ever,| said the gay
          metropolis of; the earth, the mighty city of Euphrates. |I sit alone;
          I shall see no sorrow.| Behold, she decketh herself out with scarlet,
          she arrayeth herself with silk; all the nations of the earth are quiet
          when she ariseth nor is the sound of a whisper heard when the voice of
          her command goes forth. But where art thou, daughter of Assyria, where
          art thou now, O daughter of Chaldea, where is the crown which once
          circled thy brow and adorned thy heady Go, mark a leap of rubbish, and
          of desolate stones; hear the hooting of the owls and the howling of
          the dragons, as each one calleth to his fellow in the midst of a
          desolation which cannot be repaired! How art thou fallen from heaven,
          Lucifer, son of the morning! Thus God breaketh in pieces with his
          right hand everything arrogant and supercilious, that dares to assert
          greatness apart from his endowment, or to presume on authority other
          than he delegates. I might prolong the strain. I might tell you of
          Rome, and all the boastings of that Imperial mistress, point to her
          faded charms, and tell of her decay and her decadence. I might lead
          you back to Sennacherib and all his hosts overthrown, or recite the
          story of Nebuchadnezzar, driven out from the abodes of men, and
          feeding the beasts. I might show you lesser kings, kings of Israel,
          brought exceeding low, until they who had sat on the throne as princes
          pined in the dungeon among slaves. To multiply instances would be only
          to confirm the general current of history, and illustrate the fact
          that the Lord, even the Lord of hosts, always cuts down the high tree,
          humiliates the creature that exalts itself, and suffers no flesh to
          glory in his presence. That is the law of his government.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question arises, how does it concerns us? Doubtless it opens a sad
          prospect to those who are lifted up with pride, or inflated with
          self-opinion. Are there any among you who boast in heraldry a long
          succession of illustrious names which has ennobled your pedigree? Some
          people seem to think that the world is hardly good enough for them to
          tread upon, as if they were made of china, while other men are moulded
          but of common clay; they look down upon the public as an ignoble herd,
          and speak of the masses as the |many-headed| and the |great unwashed.|
          Such a man will play the parasite to his own dear self, passionately
          cherish his own conceits and petulantly hold that whatever belongs to
          him is better than anyone else can procure for love or money, be it
          his house, or his horse, the water from his well, or the wine from his
          cellar. At his wit let all inferiors laugh; to his greed let all who,
          would receive his patronizing nod do obeisance. In stately isolation
          he will acknowledge no rival. Knowest thou, man, that in one respect
          thou hast a veritable pre-eminence? -- thou mayest fairly challenge
          all thy fellows for one whose disposition the Lord hates more than he
          abhors shine. Among the seven abominations, your order ranks highest.
          No liar or murderer can claim a preeminence over you in vice so long
          as the Proverbs stand. Ere long, the heel of the Almighty shall be
          lifted higher than thy haughty head. He will cast thee down, be thy
          look never so proud; for the Lord hath purposed it to stain the pride
          of all glory, to bring into contempt all the excellency of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, again, an arrogance of mind, of judgement, of opinion, just
          as ignorant -- if not quite so grotesque -- as his who dreams that his
          birth is of higher caste, and his blood of richer hue than other men.
          Humanity in the bulk is the idol of some people; and yonder I see the
          man who quotes himself as an illustrious specimen. He does not believe
          in the total depravity of human nature. Judging by himself, the
          statement that the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint, is a
          myth; or if it were ever true of a recreant Jew, it never was a fair
          indictment against such an orthodox Christian as he is. No, no; he has
          kept the law; he feels that in all things he is blameless; he has not
          erred, neither will he humble himself before the word that God speaks
          to us. In the opinion of such, the gospel that we preach is very good
          for harlots, thieves, and drunkards, but it is of no use to the
          righteous, for they have put down their own names among those who need
          no repentance. Admirable in their conduct, their temper amiable, and
          their disposition generous, a salvation by free grace would be wasted
          on them. The Lord will abase thee, be thou man or woman, whosoever
          thou mayest be; he will shame thee; the axe is ready to be laid at thy
          root even now. Thy goodness is not God's goodness, and thy
          righteousness is not Christ's righteousness; therefore, shall the moth
          consume it, and it shall be eaten away. Or it is my friend yonder, a
          working man, who says, | Well, I work as hard as anybody; I bring up
          my children as well as I can; I have nothing from the parish; and if I
          see a poor mate out of work, I always subscribe my mite, though I have
          not much to give away; can it be right to tell me that I am not in a
          fair way of going to heaven?| Ah! the Lord will deprive you of such
          boasting, for he will bring down all these high trees. You that have
          any righteousness of your own, whether you be rich or poor, the same
          word will apply to you all. What mattereth it whether you are born of
          princes, or the offspring of beggars, pride will nestle in any heart,
          and presumption will take advantage of any circumstances? Perhaps I
          may address some person who says, |Well, I am a member of the orthodox
          and true church; I have been baptized, and I have been confirmed after
          the most proper manner; I receive the Lord's supper on all fit and
          proper occasions. The clergyman from whom I take the sacrament has
          received apostolical ordination. How tasteful the architecture of our
          church! How decorous; the congregation! How enchanting the music!
          There are none of your rough wild notes that give vent to the
          feelings. Our organ is the perfection of mechanism, and it is played
          with the utmost skill. Our sacred singers perform their parts with
          reverent taste. Our litanies are wailed out in plaintive tones. We do
          the thing in the right style; and as I am a member of a branch of a
          catholic church, I hold myself to be an heir of eternal life.| From
          thy towering imaginations, O man, thou shalt speedily totter. God will
          cast thee down, as surely as thou livest. No boasting, even of our
          orthodoxy, or of our attention to religious formalities, shall ever be
          allowed to abide his judgment. The Lord hath set his face against all
          boastings, and all confidences, other than a trust in the cross, and a
          holy reliance on the finished work and righteousness of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or shall it fare better with another class? There is our friend who
          says, |Well, well, I do not believe in forms and ceremonies; but, mark
          you, I always judge and weigh everything.| He estimates himself as an
          independent thinker; he is bound by no precedents, fostered by no
          creeds, and considers that he is amenable to no judgment but his own.
          He owns no lord but his own conscience, no duty but such as he
          prescribes himself, and as for wisdom, he looks with indifference on
          all things whatsoever that his private judgment has not endorsed.
          Moreover, he doubts the inspiration of the Bible, and has his
          misgivings as to the authenticity of some parts of it. He indulges a
          little suspicion as to the deity of Christ, and as to the doctrines of
          grace; he professes much intelligence, but he exhibits gross
          negligence. Strong in his self-assertion, he makes light of the Word
          of God, and the will of God, while he holds prophets and apostles in
          little esteem. Ah! well, brother! God is against you; he will make a
          fool of you one of these days, if you are so wise as to exalt yourself
          above his revelation. The world shall see your folly. I tell thee,
          captious questioner, that the Lord will bring thee down. |Tut, tut,
          tut, I do not believe in any of these things,| exclaims the successful
          merchant; |I say the best thing is to push ahead on one's own account;
          I mean to save money, to get rich, to rise in the world, as others
          have done who have made capital of their own wits, and taken care of
          their own interest.| This is the religion of many people; their creed
          being that God will help those who help themselves; in their account,
          the highest wisdom is to attend to this world, and as for the world to
          come, the best policy is to ignore it. To the statutes of the Lord
          they give no heed; Evidently you see no need to depend on God. With a
          stout pair of arms and a good clear brain, you are confident you can
          make your own way in the world. Will you prosper, sir? I tell you no;
          for God is against you. The Lord will you down. Whether it be strength
          of limbs and lungs, force off brain and intellect, cunning works or
          scheming plans you rely upon, he will lay you level with the dub ere
          long. You shall know that he who exalteth himself against his maker
          maketh a sorry adventure. Disaster and everlasting confusion are your
          inevitable fate. II. FURTHERMORE THE LORD SAYS, |I WILL EXALT THE LOW
          TREE.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a word of comfort to some who specially need it. You remember
          Joseph in the dungeon, Israel in Egypt, Hannah in the family of
          Elkanah, David when Samuel would have passed him by, Hezekiah when
          Sennacherib rebuked him. Are not all these instances of God exalting
          the low tree? We have no time to expatiate on them, though they are
          well worthy of attentive study. But rather now let us ask, Where are
          the low trees here among ourselves? Who are they? The low trees are
          those poor in spirit, who think others better than they are
          themselves; who, instead of carving their names high, are willing to
          have them written low, because they feel they have nothing whereof to
          glory, nought wherein to boast. The low trees are the penitents, those
          who take their stand afar off with the publican, and say, |God, be
          merciful to me a sinner|; you that feel your own weakness to do
          anything aright; you who are conscious of your own worthlessness, and
          afraid that God will never hear your prayers; you that are bowed down
          low with a sense of guilt, and hardly dare to look up to the place
          where his honour dwelleth; you are the low trees, you are such as God
          exalteth. You, too, who tremble at his word; when, you see the
          threatening, fear lest it should be executed upon you; when you hear
          the promise, hardly think it possible that it can belong to you -- you
          are low trees -- God shall exalt you. You that feel your ignorance,
          and are willing to be instructed; you that are modest as children, and
          ready to sit at the feet of Jesus; you that have been broken in pieces
          until you feel that a crumb of mercy would be more than you deserve,
          and are willing to take any dole he is pleased to give -- you are the
          low tree. And you that are despised, who walk in darkness and see no
          light; slandered for Christ's sake; reproached with crimes you never
          committed; you of whom the world is not worthy, though the world
          accounts you to be unworthy of its esteem -- you are the low trees,
          and God shall exalt you. God grant us grace to humble ourselves under
          his mighty hand. The Lord exalteth the low trees. Is there a soul
          among you that is ready to despair -- a low tree, so low that it can
          only compare itself to a bramble-bush? Well, God dwelt in a bush. You
          may think that if he should have enemy upon all other men, yet he must
          make an exception of you, so aggravated are your offenses, so depraved
          your disposition, and so alien to anything good your natural
          temperament. Oh! bless the Lord! He exalteth the low tree. If voice
          can reach now any humble, fearful, broken-hearted soul, even though
          that soul should say it is too good to be true, yet, in God's name,
          Let me assure you it is God's message to you. Rejoice, yea, sing unto
          your God, for he will lift up the poor from the dunghill, while he
          casteth down the mighty from the seats of their pomp and their places
          of power.

        <p>
          III. THE LORD HAS ALSO DECLARED THAT |HE WILL DRY UP THE GREEN TREE.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether that green tree be high or low, it does not matter; if it be
          green in itself, he will cut it down Mark you, a man may be as high as
          heaven; if it is God that makes him high, he will stand; but if he be
          high in creature-strength, land creature-merits, and creature-glory,
          he shall be brought down; and a man may be low without merit, if he is
          merely mean and mire, paltry and pitiable, not worth a straw. That is
          not the spirit of lowliness that God blesses. In like manner, a man
          may be garden because he is planted by the rivers of God's living
          waters, that is healthy enough; but those that are like the green bay
          tree of the Psalmist, trees growing in their own soil, never
          transplanted by grace, green in the verdure of worldly prosperity, and
          taking all their delight in earthly things -- those are the trees God
          will dry up. Many I know of this kind! They profess to be God's
          people, and they say, |Well, I never have any anxiety about my eternal
          state; I do not see why I should ever have any doubts or fears. I have
          no prickings of conscience.| This green tree boasts |that its leaves
          never fade, that its evidences are always bright.| |They have no
          changes; therefore, they fear not God.| |They have not been emptied
          from vessel to vessel. They have no cares; they walk confidently, they
          talk arrogantly; they smile disdainfully at some of God's people who
          groan over their infirmities and bemoan their sins. Perhaps they go
          the length of protesting that they have no vices, and do no wrong; or
          they will say, | Why, as for me, I have overcome my bad habits and
          made amends for my youthful follies and indiscretions; and if I have
          any faults, they are only such as are natural to men, and they do not
          cause me any trouble.| He will even turn round and rail on this wise,
          |I cannot think how some of God's people can do as they do. | No; he
          is such a blessed, heavenly-minded hypocrite, that after he has
          condoned his own crimes, he condemns other people's customs; hence he
          holds up the severity of his judgment as a proof of the integrity of
          his character. He makes broad fringes to his own garment, and he
          cannot think how good men can wear such narrow fringes to theirs; he
          has a wide phylactery, and he cannot imagine how a godly man can wear
          a smaller one; he prays an hour and a half at the corner of the
          street; he cannot think that any man is godly who prays for ten
          minutes in his closet; he sounds a trumpet, and gives away three
          halfpence to the poor; he cannot understand people when they give away
          ten pounds, or a hundred pounds, in the cause of religion; he thinks
          they must have mercenary motives. He might stand up and say, |Look at
          me if you want to see what a man should be, how a Christian should
          live, and what his manner, and conduct, and conversation should be.|
          Behold the man who counts himself the paragon of perfection. Have you
          never met with such green trees? I have. These people feed without
          fear, and mock without motive. They laugh at the idea of Paul's
          apprehension, when he said, |I keep under my body, lest, after having
          preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away.| They think such
          fears inconsistent with the doctrine of final perseverance, though in
          this they are mistaken. A man may know that a true believer will
          persevere and yet be very much afraid that he shall not himself hold
          out, because he may suspect himself whether he is a true believer at
          all. This green tree is never troubled about the future; it is all
          right with him; he has launched upon a smooth, deceitful sea, and he
          believes it will be calm until he gets to the other side, as for human
          weakness, he knows nothing at all about that. He hears God's children
          crying, |Who shall deliver us from the body of this death?| and he
          looks shocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The professor, too, who boasts his deep experience, is like this green
          tree. Young Christians he frowns at -- he does not like young people.
          No; he would not have many young people in the church, because they
          might adulterate it, and bring down its spiritual tone. As to
          doctrine, he is profoundly learned; |he can a hair divide, betwixt the
          west and south-west side,| and he censures at once the man who does
          not understand all the points. He understands more than the Bible
          reveals; he has improved upon the Scriptures; and those who cannot get
          up to his standard he despises. As for the poor, and meek, and sickly
          among the people of God, he, one of the strong ones, pushes them on
          either side, and will give them no rest. Never a man yet had anything
          to boast of as his own, but God was sure to dry him up. Let your life
          be green as emerald, it shall be brown as March dust before long. You
          seek sap and nourishment from yourselves. The spider's web -- how soon
          it is blown away! Well it may, because it cometh out of the spider's
          own bowels. Everything that comes out of self, and lives on self, and
          hands on self, and fattens on self, no matter how green it may be,
          verily, verily, it shall be dried up. Lastly: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. THE LORD MAKES |THE DRY TREE TO FLOURISH.|</p>
        <p>
          There are some dry trees to be pitied in their present condition, yet
          to be congratulated on their prospects. I would not say a word to
          encourage doubting, but I would say a great many words to encourage
          doubters. How many of God's people may be fitly compared to a dry
          tree! They have little joy; they have not got to full assurance. They
          are afraid to say, |My Beloved is mine, and I am his.| Every night,
          before they go to bed, they feel such consciousness of sin that they
          can hardly sleep. They feel themselves so weak that where others go
          and think nothing of it, they dare not trust themselves. They are
          afraid to risk temptation; sometimes they are so conscious of their
          own weakness, that they do not exert themselves as they ought, and
          hence their low spirits, their melancholy, and their mourning. They
          think they are of no use to the church, they are half inclined to
          suspect it was a mistake for them to be baptized, and that they were
          to blame for uniting themselves with the people of God. |Oh!| say
          they, |if I be a lamb, I am the sickliest of the whole flock.| Were I
          an heir of promise, should I feel the assaults of sin as I do? or
          should I be so much the prey of indwelling corruption, and become so
          dry and withered? Do they retire to the closet to pray, hardly a word
          can they utter. They come to, the assembly of believers, and though
          they do sing with their lips, the heart cannot sing as it would. There
          are times, too, when walking home they say, |I go where others go, but
          I get no comfort; if I were really the Lord's, should I be thus; if I
          did trust Christ, should I ever be so languid?| Brethren, if it is of
          your own bringing about that you are thus dry, I do not offer you any
          comfort; but if the Holy Spirit has led you to see your weakness, your
          nothingness, your deadness, then I am glad you have been brought to
          this pass, for God will cause the dry tree to flourish. When we are
          weak, then are we strong. The death warrant is gone out from God
          against everything that is of the creature. All that is of nature's
          spinning must be unravelled; not your bad nature only, but your good
          nature; not your vices only, but your virtues; not your sins alone,
          but your graces; all these must be contemned and despised so far as
          you venture to put them in the place at Christ. You must cry |Away
          with them; away with them,| as if they were so much dung and dross.
          Christ's blood only for our hope, the Spirit's work only for our life.
          Here let us stand, and we shall be safe. The dry tree by divine grace
          shall flourish; the green tree, deserted by the dew of heaven, shall
          dry up. The low tree, fostered by the husbandman, shall mount even to
          the stars; the high tree, cut down by the axe of judgment, shall lay
          outstretched along the plains of ruin for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I see the last great day. There is a greater forest than this;
          this is but one corner of it. I see that forest stretched over sea and
          land, over mountain and valley. It is a forest of men. There stand the
          Pharisees, the self-righteous, the tyrants, the autocrats of haughty
          mien, the men of profound intellect with lofty brows, the men that
          questioned God's government; the infidels who said |Atheos,| and
          denied his being. I see the high trees, that towered to such an
          elevation, and attracted so much admiration; and there, too, are the
          low trees contented to he low, for Christ of Nazareth was lowly. He,
          whose disciples they are, came riding on an ass even in the day of his
          highest earthly triumph. And now I hear the trumpet ring exceeding
          loud and long. Through the glades of that vast human forest the sound
          comes ringing broad and clear, |Smite! smite! smite! and let all the
          high trees fall!| O God, what a crash!
        </p>
        <p>
          He smote great kings and slew famous kings; for his mercy endureth for
          ever. He smites. What! another crash? The orthodox who rested in their
          orthodoxy, and the self-righteous men and women fall there; yonder the
          philosophic atheist, and here the scoffing sceptic; there the haughty
          persecutor, and there, again, the pompous priest and pretentious
          ceremonialist. Gather them; in Tophet, ordained of old, pile them
          together, cedar upon oak, and elm upon fir, gather them together. pile
          them on, pile them up; let the breath of the Lord, like a stream of
          brimstone, come upon the mighty pile. It is the funeral pyre of the
          giants. There lies the dead body of sin, and here comes the living
          spouse of sin, to be immolated upon that same pile. Her name is Pride.
          She comes; they clasp. The great transgression and the evil
          imagination, together they lie down, and the flames arise. Now the
          cedars, full of resin, give forth their flame, the sparks go up to
          heaven, and the flames even unto the throne of God, whilst I hear the
          voices of multitudes singing, |Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! for
          thou hast judged the great temptress, even Pride, and thou hast given
          her up to be burned with fire!| But what of you, what of you, that
          will be faggots to that great burning? What of you, proud sons of men,
          that will be fuel to that flame? Turn ye, turn ye! Fly ye to Christ,
          and then you shall stand in the judgment, and join in the anthem,
          |Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!| |Be wise now therefore, O ye
          kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with
          fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and
          ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed
          are all they that put their trust in him.| Oh! that we all may be
          found among the humble -- not the haughty -- in our present life, and
          that we may be gathered among the blessed, not destroyed among those
          whom the Lord abhorreth, in our future destiny!<br />
