          1. How can it be regarded as otherwise than absurd, that they also
          affirm this Sophia (wisdom) to have been involved in ignorance, and
          degeneracy, and passion? For these things are alien and contrary to
          wisdom, nor can they ever be qualities belonging to it. For wherever
          there is a want of foresight, and an ignorance of the course of
          utility, there wisdom does not exist. Let them therefore no longer
          call this suffering Æon, Sophia, but let them give up either her name
          or her sufferings. And let them, moreover, not call their entire
          Pleroma spiritual, if this Æon had a place within it when she was
          involved in such a tumult of passion. For even a vigorous soul, not to
          say a spiritual substance, would not pass through any such experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And, again, how could her Enthymesis, going forth [from her] along
          with the passion, have become a separate existence? For Enthymesis
          (thought) is understood in connection with some person, and can never
          have an isolated existence by itself. For a bad Enthymesis is
          destroyed and absorbed by a good one, even as a state of disease is by
          health. What, then, was the sort of Enthymesis which preceded that of
          passion? [It was this]: to investigate the [nature of] the Father, and
          to consider His greatness. But what did she afterwards become
          persuaded of, and so was restored to health? [This, viz.], that the
          Father is incomprehensible, and that He is past finding out. It was
          not, then, a proper feeling that she wished to know the Father, and on
          this account she became passible; but when she became persuaded that
          He is unsearchable, she was restored to health. And even Nous himself,
          who was inquiring into the [nature of] the Father, ceased, according
          to them, to continue his researches, on learning that the Father is
          incomprehensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How then could the Enthymesis separately conceive passions, which
          themselves also were her affections? For affection is necessarily
          connected with an individual: it cannot come into being or exist apart
          by itself. This opinion [of theirs], however, is not only untenable,
          but also opposed to that which was spoken by our Lord: |Seek, and ye
          shall find.| For the Lord renders His disciples perfect by their
          seeking after and finding the Father; but that Christ of theirs, who
          is above, has rendered them perfect, by the fact that He has commanded
          the Æons not to seek after the Father, persuading them that, though
          they should labour hard, they would not find Him. And they declare
          that they themselves are perfect, by the fact that they maintain they
          have found their Bythus; while the Æons [have been made perfect]
          through means of this, that He is unsearchable who was inquired after
          by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Since, therefore, the Enthymesis herself could not exist
          separately, apart from the Æon, [it is obvious that] they bring
          forward still greater falsehood concerning her passion, when they
          further proceed to divide and separate it from her, while they declare
          that it was the substance of matter. As if God were not light, and as
          if no Word existed who could convict them, and overthrow their
          wickedness. For it is certainly true, that whatsoever the Æon thought,
          that she also suffered; and what she suffered, that she also thought.
          And her Enthymesis was, according to them, nothing else than the
          passion of one thinking how she might comprehend the incomprehensible.
          And thus Enthymesis (thought) was the passion; for she was thinking of
          things impossible. How then could affection and passion be separated
          and set apart from the Enthymesis, so as to become the substance of so
          vast a material creation, when Enthymesis herself was the passion, and
          the passion Enthymesis? Neither, therefore, can Enthymesis apart from
          the Æon, nor the affections apart from Enthymesis, separately possess
          substance; and thus once more their system breaks down and is
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But how did it come to pass that the Æon was both dissolved [into
          her component parts], and became subject to passion? She was
          undoubtedly of the same substance as the Pleroma; but the entire
          Pleroma was of the Father. Now, any substance, when brought in contact
          with what is of a similar nature, will not be dissolved into nothing,
          nor will be in danger of perishing, but will rather continue and
          increase, such as fire in fire, spirit in spirit, and water in water;
          but those which are of a contrary nature to each other do, [when they
          meet,] suffer and are changed and destroyed. And, in like manner, if
          there had been a production of light, it would not suffer passion, or
          recur any danger in light like itself, but would rather glow with the
          greater brightness, and increase, as the day does from [the increasing
          brilliance of] the sun; for they maintain that Bythus [himself] was
          the image of their father (Sophia). Whatever animals are alien [in
          habits] and strange to each other, or are mutually opposed in nature,
          fall into danger [on meeting together], and are destroyed; whereas, on
          the other hand, those who are accustomed to each other, and of a
          harmonious disposition, suffer no peril from being together in the
          same place, but rather secure both safety and life by such a fact. If,
          therefore, this Æon was produced by the Pleroma of the same substance
          as the whole of it, she could never have undergone change, since she
          was consorting with beings similar to and familiar with herself, a
          spiritual essence among those that were spiritual. For fear, terror,
          passion, dissolution, and such like, may perhaps occur through the
          struggle of contraries among such beings as we are, who are possessed
          of bodies; but among spiritual beings, and those that have the light
          diffused among them, no such calamities can possibly happen. But these
          men appear to me to have endowed their Æon with the [same sort of]
          passion as belongs to that character in the comic poet Menander, who
          was himself deeply in love, but an object of hatred [to his beloved].
          For those who have invented such opinions have rather had an idea and
          mental conception of some unhappy lover among men, than of a spiritual
          and divine substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Moreover, to meditate how to search into [the nature of] the
          perfect Father, and to have a desire to exist within Him, and to have
          a comprehension of His [greatness], could not entail the stain of
          ignorance or passion, and that upon a spiritual Æon; but would rather
          [give rise to] perfection, and impassibility, and truth. For they do
          not say that even they, though they be but men, by meditating on Him
          who was before them, -- and while now, as it were, comprehending the
          perfect, and being placed within the knowledge of Him, -- are thus
          involved in a passion of perplexity, but rather attain to the
          knowledge and apprehension of truth. For they affirm that the Saviour
          said, |Seek, and ye shall find,| to His disciples with this view, that
          they should seek after Him who, by means of imagination, has been
          conceived of by them as being above the Maker of all -- the ineffable
          Bythus; and they desire themselves to be regarded as |the perfect;|
          because they have sought and found the perfect One, while they are
          still on earth. Yet they declare that that Æon who was within the
          Pleroma, a wholly spiritual being, by seeking after the Propator, and
          endeavouring to find a place within His greatness, and desiring to
          have a comprehension of the truth of the Father, fell down into [the
          endurance of] passion, and such a passion that, unless she had met
          with that Power who upholds all things, she would have been dissolved
          into the general substance [of the Æons], and thus come to an end of
          her [personal] existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Absurd is such presumption, and truly an opinion of men totally
          destitute of the truth. For, that this Æon is superior to themselves,
          and of greater antiquity, they themselves acknowledge, according to
          their own system, when they affirm that they are the fruit of the
          Enthymesis of that Æon who suffered passion, so that this Æon is the
          father of their mother, that is, their own grandfather. And to them,
          the later grandchildren, the search after the Father brings, as they
          maintain, truth, and perfection, and establishment, and deliverance
          from unstable matter, and reconciliation to the Father; but on their
          grandfather this same search entailed ignorance, and passion, and
          terror, and perplexity, from which [disturbances] they also declare
          that the substance of matter was formed. To say, therefore, that the
          search after and investigation of the perfect Father, and the desire
          for communion and union with Him, were things quite beneficial to
          them, but to an Æon, from whom also they derive their origin, these
          things were the cause of dissolution and destruction, how can such
          assertions be otherwise viewed than as totally inconsistent, foolish,
          and irrational? Those, too, who listen to these teachers, truly blind
          themselves, while they possess blind guides, justly [are left to] fall
          along with them into the gulf of ignorance which lies below them.
