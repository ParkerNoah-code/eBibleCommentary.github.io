          |But when he was yet a great way off; his father saw him, and had
          compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.| -- Luke
          15:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALL PERSONS ENGAGED IN EDUCATION will tell you that they find it far
          more difficult to make the mind unlearn its errors than to make it
          receive truth. If we could suppose a man totally ignorant of anything,
          we should have a fairer chance of instructing him quickly and
          effectually than we should have had if his mind had been previously
          stored with falsehood. I have no doubt you, each of you, find it
          harder to unlearn than to learn. To get rid of old prejudices and
          preconceived notions is a very hard struggle indeed. It has been well
          said, that those few words, |I am mistaken,| are the hardest in all
          the English language to pronounce, and certainly it takes very much
          force to compel us to pronounce them: and after having done so, it is
          even then difficult to wipe away the slime which an old serpentine
          error has left upon the heart. Better for us not to have known at all
          than to have known the wrong thing. Now, I am sure that this truth is
          never more true than when it applies to God. If I had been let alone
          to form my notion of God, entirely from Holy Scripture, I feel, that
          with the assistance of his Holy Spirit it would have been far more
          easy for me to understand what he is, and how he governs the world,
          than to learn even the truths of his own Word, after the mind had
          become perverted by the opinions of others. Why, brethren, who is it
          that gives a fair representation of God? The Arminian slanders God by
          accusing him (not in his own intention, but really so) of
          unfaithfulness; for he teaches that God may promise what he never
          performs; that he may give eternal life, and promise that those who
          have it shall never perish, and yet they may perish after all. He
          speaks of God as if he were a mutable being, for he talks of his
          loving men one day, and hating them the next; of his writing their
          names in the Book of Life one hour, and then erasing their names in
          the next. And the influence of such an error as that, is very baneful.
          Many children of God, who have imbibed these errors in early youth,
          have had to drag along their poor wearied and broken frames for many a
          day, whereas they might have walked joyfully to heaven if they had
          known the truth from the beginning. On the other hand, those who hear
          the Calvinistic preacher, are very apt to misinterpret God. Although
          we trust we would never speak of God in any other sense than that in
          which we find him represented in sacred Scripture, yet are we well
          aware that many of our hearers, even through our assertions, when most
          guarded, are apt to get rather a caricature of God, than a true
          picture of him. They imagine that God is a severe being, angry and
          fierce, very easily to be moved to wrath, but not so easily to be
          induced to love; they are apt to think of him as one who sits in
          supreme and lofty state, either totally indifferent to the wishes of
          his creatures, or else determined to have his own way with them, as an
          arbitrary Sovereign, never listening to their desires, or
          compassionating their woes. O that we could unlearn all these
          fallacies, and believe God to be what he is! O that we could come to
          Scripture, and there look into that glass which reflects his sacred
          image, and then receive him as he is, the all-Wise, the all-Just, and
          yet the all-Gracious, and all-Loving Jehovah! I shall endeavor this
          morning, by the help of God's Holy Spirit, to represent the lovely
          character of Christ; and if I shall be happy enough to have some in my
          audience who are in the position of the prodigal son in the parable --
          coming to Christ, and yet a great way off from him -- I shall trust
          that they will be led by the same Divine Spirit, to believe in the
          loving kindness of Jehovah, and so may find peace with God now, ere
          they leave this house of prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          |When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
          compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.| First, I
          shall notice the position intended in the words, |a great way off ;|
          secondly, I shall notice the peculiar troubles which agitate the minds
          of those, who are in this condition; and then, thirdly, I shall
          endeavor to teach the great loving-kindness of our own adorable God,
          inasmuch as when we are |a great way off,| he runs to us, and embraces
          us in the arms of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, what is the POSITION signified by being |a great way
          off?| I must just notice what is not that position. It is not the
          position of the man who is careless and entirely regardless of God;
          for you notice that the prodigal is represented now as having come to
          himself, and as returning to his father's house. Though it be true
          that all sinners are a great way off from God, whether they know it or
          not, yet in this particular instance, the position of the poor
          prodigal is intended to signify the character of one, who has been
          aroused by conviction, who has been led to abhor his former life, and
          who sincerely desires to return to God. I shall not, then, this
          morning, specially address the blasphemer, and the profane. To him,
          there may be some incidental warning heard, but I shall not specially
          address such a character. It is another person for whom this text is
          intended: the man who has been a blasphemer, if you please, who may
          have been a drunkard, and a swearer, and what not, but who has now
          renounced these things, and is steadfastly seeking after Christ, that
          he may obtain eternal life. That is the man who is here said to be,
          though coming to the Lord, |a great way off.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, there is another person who is not intended by this
          description, namely, the very great man, the Pharisee who thinks
          himself extremely righteous, and has never learned to confess his sin.
          You, sir, in your apprehension, are not a great way off. You are so
          really in the sight of God; you are as far from him as light from
          darkness, as the east is from the west; but you are not spoken of
          here. You are like the prodigal son, only that instead of spending
          your life righteously, you have run away from your Father, and hidden
          in the earth the gold which he gave you, and are able to feed upon the
          husks which swine do eat, whilst by a miserable economy of good works
          you are hoping to save enough of your fortune to support yourself here
          and in eternity. Your hope of self-salvation is a fallacy, and you are
          not addressed in the words of the text. It is the man who knows
          himself lost, but desires to be saved, who is here declared to be met
          by God, and received with affectionate embraces.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we come to the question, Who is the man, and why is he said to
          be a great way off? For he seems to be very near the kingdom, now that
          he knows his need and is seeking the Saviour. I reply, in the first
          place, he is a great way off in his own apprehensions. You are here
          this morning, and you have an idea that never was man so far from God
          as you are. You look back upon your past life, and you recollect how
          you have slighted God, despised his Sabbath, neglected his Book,
          trampled upon the blood of sprinkling, and rejected all the
          invitations of his mercy. You turn over the pages of your history, and
          you remember the sins which you have committed -- the sins of your
          youth and your former transgressions, the crimes of your manhood, and
          the riper sins of your older years; like black waves dashing upon a
          dark shore, they roll in wave upon wave, upon your poor troubled
          memory. There comes a little wave of your childish folly, and over
          that there leaps one of your youthful transgressions, and over the
          head of this there comes a very Atlantic billow of your manhood's
          transgressions. At the sight of them you stand astonished and amazed.
          |O Lord my God, how deep is the gulf which divides me from thyself,
          and where is the power that can bridge it? I am separated from thee by
          leagues of sin, whole mountains of my guilt are piled upward between
          me and thyself. O God, shouldest thou destroy me now, thou wouldest be
          just; and if thou dost ever bring me to thyself, it must be nothing
          less than a power as Omnipotent as that which made the world, which
          can ever do it. O! how far am I from God!| Some of you would be
          startled this morning, if your neighbors were to give you revelations
          of their own feelings. If yonder man standing there in the crowd could
          come into this pulpit, and tell you what he now feels, you might
          perhaps be horrified at his description of his own heart. How many of
          you have no notion of the way in which a soul is cut and hacked about,
          when it is under the convictions of the law! If you should hear the
          man tell out what he feels, you would say, |Ah! he is a poor deluded
          enthusiast; men are not so bad as that;| or else you would be apt to
          think he had committed some nameless crime which be dare not mention.
          that was preying on his conscience. Nay, sir, he has been as moral and
          upright as you have been; but should he describe himself as he now
          discovers himself to be, he would shock you utterly. And yet you are
          the same, though you feel it not, and would indignantly deny it. When
          the light of God's grace comes into your heart, it is something like
          the opening of the windows of an old cellar that has been shut up for
          many days. Down in that cellar, which has not been opened for many
          months, are all kinds of loathsome creatures, and a few sickly plants
          blanched by the darkness. The walls are dark and damp with the trail
          of reptiles; it is a horrid filthy place, in which no one would
          willingly enter. You may walk there in the dark very securely, and
          except now and then for the touch of some slimy creature, you would
          not believe the place was so bad and filthy. Open those shutters,
          clean a pane of glass, let a little light in, and now see how a
          thousand noxious things have made this place their habitation. Sure,
          twas not the light that made this place so horrible, but it was the
          light that showed how horrible it was before. So let God's grace just
          open a window and let the light into a man's soul, and he will stand
          astonished to see at what a distance he is from God. Yes, sir, to-day
          you think yourself second to none but the Eternal; you fancy that you
          can approach his throne with steady step; it is but a little that you
          have to do to be saved; you imagine that you can accomplish it at any
          hour, and save yourself upon your dying bed as well as now. Ah! sir,
          if you could but be touched by Ithuriel's wand, and made to be in
          appearance what you are in reality, then you would see that you are
          far enough from God even now, and so far from him that unless the arms
          of his grace were stretched out to bring you to himself, you must
          perish in your sin. Now I turn my eye again with hope, and trust I
          leave not a few in this large assembly who can say, |Sir, I feel I am
          far from God, and sometimes I fear I am so far from him that he will
          never have mercy upon me; I dare not lift so much as my eyes towards
          heaven; I smite on my breast, and say, Lord, have mercy upon me, a
          sinner'| Oh! poor heart; here is a comforting passage for thee: |When
          he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion on
          him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, there is a second sense in which some now present may feel
          themselves to be far off from God. Conscience tells every man that if
          he would be saved he must get rid of his sin. The Antinomian may
          possibly pretend to believe that men can be saved while they live in
          sin; but conscience will never allow any man to swallow so egregious a
          lie as that. I have not one person in this congregation who is not
          perfectly assured that if he is to be saved he must leave off his
          drunkenness and his vices. Sure there is not one here so stupefied
          with the laudanum of hellish indifference as to imagine that he can
          revel in his lusts, and afterwards wear the white robe of the redeemed
          in paradise. If ye imagine ye can be partakers of the blood of Christ,
          and yet drink the cup of Belial; if ye imagine that ye can be members
          of Satan and members of Christ at the same time, ye have less sense
          than one would give you credit for. No, you know that right arms must
          be out off, and right eyes plucked out -- that the most darling sins
          must be renounced, if ye would enter into the kingdom of God. And I
          have a man here who is convinced of the unholiness of his life, and he
          has striven to reform, not because he thinks reformation would save
          him, for he knows better than that, but because he knows that this is
          one of the first-fruits of grace -- reformation from sin. Well, poor
          man, he has for many years been an inveterate drunkard, and he
          struggles now to overcome the passion. He has almost effected it; but
          he never had such an Herculean labor to attempt before; for now some
          temptation comes upon him so strongly that it is as much as he can do
          to stand against it; and perhaps sometimes since his first conviction
          of sin he has even fallen into it. Or perhaps it is another vice, and
          you, my brother, have set your face against it; but there are many
          bonds and fetters that bind us to our vices, and you find that though
          it was easy enough to spin the warp and woof sin together, it is not
          so easy to unravel that which you have spun. You can not purge your
          house of your idols; you do not yet know how to give up all your
          lustful pleasures. Not yet can you renounce the company of the
          ungodly. You have cut off one by one your most intimate acquaintances,
          but it is very hard to do it completely, and you are struggling to
          accomplish it, and you often fall on your knees and cry, |O, Lord, how
          far I am from thee! what high steps these are which I have to climb!
          Oh! how can I be saved? Sure, if I can not purge myself from my old
          sins, I shall never be able to hold on my way; and even should I get
          rid of them, I should plunge into them once more.| You are crying out,
          |Oh, how great my distance from God! Lord, bring me near!|
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me present you with one other aspect of our distance from God. You
          have read your Bibles, and you believe that faith alone can unite the
          soul to Christ. You feel that unless you can believe in him who died
          upon the cross for your sins, you can never see the kingdom of God;
          but you can say this morning, |Sir, I have striven to believe; I have
          searched the Scriptures, not hours, but days together, to find a
          promise on which my weary foot might rest; I have been upon my knees
          many and many a time, earnestly supplicating a Divine blessing; but
          though I have pleaded, all in vain I have urged my plea, for until now
          no whisper have I had of grace, no token for good, no sign of mercy.
          Sir, I have striven to believe, and I have said,
        </p>
        <p>|O could I but believe</p>
        <p>Then all would easy be;</p>
        <p>I would, but can not -- Lord, relieve,</p>
        <p>My help must come from thee!|</p>
        <p>
          I have used all the power I have, and have desperately striven to cast
          myself at the Saviour's feet and see my sins washed sway in his blood.
          I have not been indifferent to the story of the cross; I have read it
          a hundred times, and even wept over it; but when I strive to put my
          hand upon the scape-goat's head, and labor to believe that my sins are
          transferred to him, some demon seems to stop the breath that would
          breathe itself forth in adoration, and something checks the hand that
          would lay itself upon the head that died for me. Well, poor soul, thou
          art indeed far from God. I will repeat the words of the text to thee.
          May the Holy Spirit repeat them in thine ear! |When he was yet a great
          way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on
          his neck, and kissed him.| So shall it be with thee if thou hast come
          thus far, though great may be the distance, thy feet shall not have to
          travel it, but God, the Eternal One, shall from his throne look down
          and visit thy poor heart, though now thou tarriest by the way, afraid
          to approach him.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second point is the PECULIAR TROUBLES which agitate the
          breasts of those who are in this position. Let us introduce to you the
          poor ragged prodigal. After a life of ease, he is, by his own vice,
          plunged into penury and labor. After feeding swine for a time, and
          being almost starved, he sets about returning to his father's house.
          It is a long and weary journey. He walks many a mile, until his feet
          are sore, and at last, from the summit of a mountain, he views his
          father's house far away in the plain. There are yet many miles between
          him and his father whom he has neglected. Can you conceive his
          emotions when, for the first time after so long an absence, he sees
          the old house at home? He remembers it well in the distance, for
          though it is long since he trod its floors, he has never ceased to
          recollect it; and the remembrance of his father's kindness, and of his
          own prosperity when he was with him, has never yet been erased from
          his consciousness. You would imagine that for one moment he feels a
          flash of joy, like some flash of lightning in the midst of the
          tempest, but anon a black darkness comes over his spirit. In the first
          place, it is probable he will think, |Oh! suppose I could reach my
          home, will my father receive me? Will he not shut the door in my face
          and tell me begone and spend the rest of my life where I have been
          spending the first of it?| Then another suggestion might arise:
          |Surely, the demon that led me first astray may lead me back again,
          before I salute my parent.| |Or mayhap,| thought he, |I may even die
          upon the road, and so, before I have received my father's blessing, my
          soul may stand before its God.| I doubt not each of these three
          thoughts has crossed your mind if you are now in the position of one
          who is seeking Christ, but mourns to feel himself far away from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you have been afraid lest you should die before Christ has
          appeared to you. You have been for months seeking the Saviour without
          finding him, and now the black thought comes, |And what if I should
          die with all these prayers unanswered? Oh! if he would but hear me ere
          I departed this world I would be content, though he should keep me
          waiting in anguish for many years. But what, if before tomorrow
          morning I should be a corpse? At my bed I kneel to-night and cry for
          mercy. Oh! if he should not send the pardon before to-morrow morning,
          and in the night my spirit should stand before his bar! -- What then?|
          It is singular that other men think they shall live for ever, but men
          convinced of sin, who seek a Saviour, are afraid they shall not live
          another moment. You have known the time, dear Christian brethren, when
          you dared not shut your eyes for feel you should not open them again
          on earth; when you dreaded the shadows of the night lest they should
          darken for ever the light of the sun, and you should dwell in outer
          darkness throughout eternity. You have mourned as each day has
          entered, and you have wept as it has departed, because you fancied
          that your next step might precipitate you into your eternal doom. I
          have known what it is to tread the earth and fear lest every tuft of
          grass should but cover a door to hell; trembling, lest every particle,
          and every atom, and every stone, should be solar league with God
          against me, as to destroy me. John Bunyan says, that at one time in
          his experience, he felt that he had rather have been born a dog or a
          toad than a man; he felt so unutterably wretched on account of sin;
          and his great point of wretchedness was the fact, that though he had
          been three years seeking Christ, he might after all die without
          finding him. And in truth, this is no needless alarm. It may be
          perhaps too alarming to some who already feel their need of Christ,
          but the mass of us need perpetually to be startled with the thought of
          death. How few of you ever indulge that thought! Because ye live and
          are in health, and eat, and drink, and sleep, ye think ye shall not
          die. Do ye ever soberly look at your last end? Do ye ever, when ye
          come to your beds at night, think how one day ye shall undress for the
          last slumber? And when ye wake in the morning, do ye never think that
          the trump of the archangel shall startle you to appear before God in
          the last day of the great assize, wherein an universe shall stand
          before the Judge? No. |All men think all men mortal but themselves;|
          and thoughts of death we still push off, until at last we shall find
          ourselves waking up in torment, where to wake is to wake too late. But
          thou to whom I specially speak this morning, thou who feelest that
          thou art a great way off from Christ, thou shalt never die, but live,
          and declare the works of the Lord; if thou hast really sought him,
          thou shalt never die until thou hast found him. There was never a soul
          yet, that sincerely sought the Saviour, who perished before he found
          him. No; the gates of death shall never shut on thee till the gates of
          grace have opened for thee; till Christ has washed thy sins away thou
          shalt never be baptized in Jordan's flood. Thy life is secure, for
          this is God's constant plan -- he keeps his own elect alive till the
          day of his grace, and then he takes them to himself. And inasmuch as
          thou knowest thy need of a Saviour, thou art one of his, and thou
          shalt never die until thou hast found him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your second fear is, |Ah, sir! I am not afraid of dying before I find
          Christ, I have a worse fear than that; I have had convictions before,
          and they have often passed away; my greatest fear to-day is, that
          these will be the same.| I have heard of a poor collier, who on one
          occasion, having been deeply impressed under a sermon, was led to
          repent of sin and forsake his former life; but he felt so great horror
          of ever returning to his former conversation, that one day he knelt
          down and cried thus unto God, |O Lord, let me die on this spot, rather
          than ever deny the religion which I have espoused, and turn back to my
          former conversation:| and we are credibly told, that he died on that
          very spot, and so his prayer was answered. God had rather take him
          home to heaven than suffer him to bear the brunt of temptation on
          earth. Now, when men come to Christ, they feel that they had rather
          suffer anything than lose their convictions. Scores of times have you
          and I been drawn to Christ under the preaching of the Word. We can
          look back upon dozens of occasions on which it seemed just the turning
          point with us. Something said in our hearts, |Now, believe in Christ,
          now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation.| But we said,
          |To-morrow, to-morrow ;| and when to-morrow came our convictions were
          gone. We thought what we said yesterday would be the deed of to-day;
          but instead of it, the procrastination of yesterday became the
          hardened wickedness of to-day: we wandered farther from God and forgot
          him. Now you are crying to him for fear, lest he should give you up
          again. You have this morning prayed before you came here, and you
          said, |Father, suffer not my companions to laugh me out of my
          religion; let not my worldly business so engross my thoughts, as to
          prevent my due attention to the matters of another world. Oh, let not
          the trifles of to-day so absorb my thoughts that I may not be
          preparing myself to meet my God --
        </p>
        <p>'Deeply on my thoughtful heart,</p>
        <p>Eternal things impress,'</p>
        <p>
          and make this a real saving work that shall never die out, nor be
          taken from me.| Is that your earnest prayer? O poor prodigal, it shall
          be heard, it shall be answered. Thou shalt not have time to go back.
          To-day thy Father views thee from his throne in heaven; to-day he runs
          to thee in the message of his gospel; today he falls upon thy neck and
          weeps for joy; to-day he says to thee, |Thy sins, which are many, are
          all forgiven ;| to-day, by the preaching of the Word, he bids thee
          come and reason with him, |for though thy sins be as scarlet, they
          shall be as wool, though the be red like crimson, they shall be whiter
          than snow.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But the last and the most prominent thought which I suppose the
          prodigal would have, would be, that when he did get to his father, he
          would say to him, |Get along with you, I will have nothing more to do
          with you.| |Ah!| thought he to himself, |I recollect the morning, when
          I rose up before day-break, because I knew I could not stand my
          mothers tears; I remember how I crept down the back staircase and took
          all the money with me, how I stole down the yard and ran away into the
          land where I spent my all. Oh! what will the old gentlemen say of me
          when I come back? Why, there he is! he is running to me. But he has
          got a horsewhip with him, to be sure, to whip me away. It is not at
          all possible that if he comes he will have a kind word for me. The
          most I can expect is that he will say, Well John, you have wasted all
          your money, you can not expect me to do anything for you again. I
          won't let you starve; you shall be one of my servants: there, come, I
          will take you as footman;' and if he will do that I will be obliged to
          him; nay, that is the very thing I will ask of him; I will say, Make
          me as one of thy hired servants.'| |Oh,| said the devil within him,
          |your father will never speak comfortably to you: you had better run
          away again. I tell you if he gets near you, you will have such a
          dressing as you never received in your life. You will die with a
          broken heart; you will very likely fall dead here; the old man will
          never bury you; the carrion crows win eat you. There is no hope for
          you: see how you have treated him. Put yourself in his place: what
          would you do if you had a son that had run away with half your living,
          and spent it upon harlots?| And the son thought if he were in his
          fathers place he should be very harsh and severe; and possibly, he
          almost turned upon his heel to run away. But he had not time to do
          that. When he was just thinking about running away, on a sudden his
          father's arms were about his neck, and he had received the paternal
          kiss. Nay, before he could get his whole prayer finished, he was
          arrayed in a white robe, the best in the house; and they had brought
          him to the table, and the fatted calf was being killed for his repast.
          And poor soul, it shall be so with you. Thou sayest, |If I go to God,
          he win never receive me. I am too vile and wretched: others he may
          have pressed to his heart, but he will not me. If my brother should
          go, he might be saved; but there are such aggravations in my crime; I
          have grown so old since; I have done such a deal of mischief; I have
          so often blasphemed him, so frequently broken his Sabbaths; ah! and I
          have so often deceived him; I have promised I would repent, and when I
          got well I have lied to God, and gone back to my old sin. Oh, if he
          would but let me creep inside the door of heaven! I win not ask to be
          one of his children; I win only ask that he will let me be where the
          Syro-Phoenician woman desired to be -- to be a dog, to eat the crumbs
          that fall from the Master's table. That is all I ask; and oh! if he
          will but grant it to me, he shall never hear the last of it, for as
          long as I live I will sing his praise; and when the world doth fade
          away, and the sun grow dim with age, my gratitude, immortal as my
          soul, shall never cease to sing his love, who pardoned my grossest
          sins and washed me in his blood.| It shad be so. Come and try. Now,
          sinners, dry your tears; let hopeless sorrows cease; look to the
          wounds of Christ, who died; let all your griefs now be removed, there
          is no further cause for them; your Father loves you; he accepts and
          receives you to his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, in conclusion, I may notice HOW THESE FEARS WERE MET IN THE
          PRODIGAL'S CASE, and how they shall be met in ours if we are in the
          same condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text says, |The Father saw him.| Yes, and God saw thee just now.
          That tear which was wiped away so hastily -- as if thou wast ashamed
          of it -- God saw it, and he stored it in his bottle. That prayer which
          thou didst breathe just a few moments ago, so faintly, and with such
          little faith -- God heard it. The other day thou wast in thy chamber,
          where no ear heard thee; but God was there. Sinner, let this be thy
          comfort, that God sees thee when thou beginnest to repent. He does not
          see thee with his usual gaze, with which he looks on all men; but he
          sees thee with an eye of intense interest. He has been looking on thee
          in an thy sin, and in all thy sorrow, hoping that thou wouldst repent;
          and now he sees the first gleam of grace, and he beholds it with joy.
          Never warder on the lonely castle top saw the first grey light of
          morning with more joy than that with which God beholds the first
          desire in thy heart. Never physician rejoiced more when he saw the
          first heaving of the lungs in one that was supposed to be dead, than
          God doth rejoice over thee, now that he sees the first token for good.
          Think not that thou art despised and unknown, and forgotten. He is
          marking thee from his high throne in glory, and rejoicing in what he
          sees. He saw thee pray, he heard thee groan; he marked thy tear; he
          looked upon thee and rejoiced to see that these were the first seeds
          of grace in thine heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, the text says, |he had compassion on him.| He did not merely
          see him, but he wept within himself to think he should be in such a
          condition. The old father had a very long range of eye-sight; and
          though the prodigal could not see him in the distance, he could see
          the prodigal. And the fathers first thought when he saw him was this
          -- |O my poor son, O my poor boy! that ever he should have brought
          himself into such a state as this!| He looked through his telescope of
          love, and he saw him, and said, |Ah! he did not go out of my house in
          such trim as that. Poor creature, his feet are bleeding; he has come a
          long way, I'll be bound. Look at his face, he doesn't look like the
          same boy he was when he left me. His eye that was so bright, is now
          sunken in its socket; his cheeks that once stood out with fatness,
          have now become hollow with famine. Poor wretch, I can tell all his
          bones, he is so emaciated.| Instead of feeling any anger in his heart,
          he felt just the contrary; he felt such pity for his poor son. And so
          the Lord feels for you -- you that are groaning and moaning on account
          of sin. He forgets your sins; he only weeps to think you should have
          brought yourself to be what you are: |Why didst thou rebel against me,
          and bring thyself into such a state as this?| It was just like that
          day when Adam sinned. God walked in the garden, and he missed Adam. He
          did not cry out, |Adam, come here and be judged!| No; with a soft,
          sorrowful, and plaintive voice, he said, |Adam, where art thou? Oh, my
          fair Adam, thou whom I made so happy, where art thou now? Oh, Adam!
          thou didst think to become a God; where art thou now? Thou hast walked
          with me: dost thou hide thyself from thy friend? Little dost thou
          know, O Adam, what woes thou hast brought on thyself, and thine
          offspring. Adam, where art thou?| And Jehovah bowels yearn to-day over
          you. He is not angry with you; his anger is passed away, and his hands
          are stretched out still. Inasmuch as he has brought you to feel that
          you have sinned against him, and to desire reconciliation with him,
          there is no wrath in his heart. The only sorrow that he feels is
          sorrow that you should have brought yourself into a state so mournful
          as that in which you now are found.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he did not stop in mere compassion. Having had compassion, |he
          ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.| This you do not understand
          yet; but you shall. As sure as God is God, if you this day are seeking
          him aright through Christ, the day shall come when the kiss of full
          assurance shall be on your lip, when the arms of sovereign love shall
          embrace you, and you shall know it to be so. Thou mayest have despised
          him, but thou shalt know him yet to be thy Father and thy Friend. Thou
          mayest have scoffed his name: thou shalt one day come to rejoice in it
          as better than pure gold. Thou mayest have broken his Sabbaths and
          despised his Word; the day is coming when the Sabbath shall be thy
          delight, and his Word thy treasure. Yes, marvel not; thou mayest have
          plunged into the kennel of sin, and made thy clothes black with
          iniquity; but thou shalt one day stand before his throne white as the
          angels be; and that tongue that once cursed him shall yet sing his
          praise. If thou be a real seeker, the hands that have been stained
          with lust shall one day grasp the harp of gold, and the head that has
          plotted against the Most High shall yet be girt with gold. Seemeth it
          not a strange thing that God should do so much for sinners? But
          strange though it seem, it shall be strangely true. Look at the
          staggering drunkard in the ale-house. Is there a possibility that one
          day he shall stand among the fairest sons of light? Possibility! ay,
          certainty, if he repents and turns from the error of his ways. Hear
          you yon curser and swearer? See you the man who labels himself as a
          servant of hell, and is not ashamed to do so? Is it possible that he
          shall one day share the bliss of the redeemed? Possible! ay, more, it
          is sure, if he turneth from his evil ways. O sovereign grace, turn men
          that they may repent! |Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die, O house of
          Israel?|
        </p>
        <p>|Lord, do thou the sinner turn,</p>
        <p>For thy tender mercy's sake.|</p>
        <p>
          One word or so, and I have done. If any of you to-day are under
          conviction of sin, let me solemnly warn you not to frequent places
          where those convictions are likely too be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A correspondent of the New York Christian Advocate furnishes the
          following affecting narrative: --
        </p>
        <p>
          |When I was travelling in the state of Massachusetts, twenty-six years
          ago, after preaching one evening in the town of __________, a very
          serious-looking young man arose, and wished to address the assembly.
          After obtaining leave, he spoke as follows: -- 'My friends, about one
          year ago, I set out in company with a young man of my intimate
          acquaintance, to seek the salvation of my soul. For several weeks we
          went on together, we laboured together, and often renewed our covenant
          not to give over seeking till we obtained the religion of Jesus. But,
          all at once, the young man neglected attending meeting, appeared to
          turn his back on all the means of grace, and grew so shy of me, that I
          could scarcely get an opportunity to speak with him. His strange
          conduct gave me much painful anxiety of mind; but still I felt
          resolved to obtain the salvation of my soul, or perish, making the
          publican's plea. After a few days, a friend informed me that my young
          companion had received an invitation to a ball, and was determined to
          go. I went immediately to him, and, with tears in my eyes, endeavoured
          to persuade him to change his purpose, and to go with me on that
          evening to a prayer-meeting. I pleaded with him in vain. He told me,
          when we parted, that I must not give him up as lost, for after he had
          attended that ball, he intended to make a business of seeking
          religion. The appointed evening came, and he went to the ball, and I
          went to the prayer-meeting. Soon after the meeting opened, it pleased
          God, in answer to my prayer, to turn my spiritual captivity, and make
          my soul rejoice in his justifying love. Soon after the ball opened, my
          young friend was standing at the head of the ball-room, with the hand
          of a young lady in his hand, preparing to lead down the dance; and,
          while the musician was turning his violin,, without one moment's
          warning, the young man sallied back, and fell dead on the floor. I was
          immediately sent for, to assist in devising means to convey his
          remains to his father's house. You will be better able to judge what
          were the emotions of my heart, when I tell you that that young man was
          my own brother.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Trifle not, then, with thy convictions, for eternity shall be too
          short for thee to utter thy lamentations over such trifling.
