          1. By transmitting to thee, my very dear friend, this fourth book of
          the work which is [entitled] The Detection and Refutation of False
          Knowledge, I shall, as I have promised, add weight, by means of the
          words of the Lord, to what I have already advanced; so that thou also,
          as thou hast requested, mayest obtain from me the means of confuting
          all the heretics everywhere, and not permit them, beaten back at all
          points, to launch out further into the deep of error, nor to be
          drowned in the sea of ignorance; but that thou, turning them into the
          haven of the truth, mayest cause them to attain their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The man, however, who would undertake their conversion, must
          possess an accurate knowledge of their systems or schemes of doctrine.
          For it is impossible for any one to heal the sick, if he has no
          knowledge of the disease of the patients. This was the reason that my
          predecessors -- much superior men to myself, too -- were unable,
          notwithstanding, to refute the Valentinians satisfactorily, because
          they were ignorant of these men's system; which I have with all care
          delivered to thee in the first book in which I have also shown that
          their doctrine is a recapitulation of all the heretics. For which
          reason also, in the second, we have had, as in a mirror, a sight of
          their entire discomfiture. For they who oppose these men (the
          Valentinians) by the right method, do [thereby] oppose all who are of
          an evil mind; and they who overthrow them, do in fact overthrow every
          kind of heresy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For their system is blasphemous above all [others], since they
          represent that the Maker and Framer, who is one God, as I have shown,
          was produced from a defect or apostasy. They utter blasphemy, also,
          against our Lord, by cutting off and dividing Jesus from Christ, and
          Christ from the Saviour, and again the Saviour from the Word, and the
          Word from the Only-begotten. And since they allege that the Creator
          originated from a defect or apostasy, so have they also taught that
          Christ and the Holy Spirit were emitted on account of this defect, and
          that the Saviour was a product of those Ã†ons who were produced from a
          defect; so that there is nothing but blasphemy to be found among them.
          In the preceding book, then, the ideas of the apostles as to all these
          points have been set forth, [to the effect] that not only did they,
          |who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word|
          of truth, hold no such opinions, but that they did also preach to us
          to shun these doctrines, foreseeing by the Spirit those weak-minded
          persons who should be led astray.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For as the serpent beguiled Eve, by promising her what he had not
          himself, so also do these men, by pretending [to possess] superior
          knowledge, and [to be acquainted with] ineffable mysteries; and, by
          promising that admittance which they speak of as taking place within
          the Pleroma, plunge those that believe them into death, rendering them
          apostates from Him who made them. And at that time, indeed, the
          apostate angel, having effected the disobedience of mankind by means
          of the serpent, imagined that he escaped the notice of the Lord;
          wherefore God assigned him the form and name [of a serpent]. But now,
          since the last times are [come upon us], evil is spread abroad among
          men, which not only renders them apostates, but by many machinations
          does [the devil] raise up blasphemers against the Creator, namely, by
          means of all the heretics already mentioned. For all these, although
          they issue forth from diverse regions, and promulgate different
          [opinions], do nevertheless concur in the same blasphemous design,
          wounding [men] unto death, by teaching blasphemy against God our Maker
          and Supporter, and derogating from the salvation of man. Now man is a
          mixed organization of soul and flesh, who was formed after the
          likeness of God, and moulded by His hands, that is, by the Son and
          Holy Spirit, to whom also He said, |Let Us make man.| This, then, is
          the aim of him who envies our life, to render men disbelievers in
          their own salvation, and blasphemous against God the Creator. For
          whatsoever all the heretics may have advanced with the utmost
          solemnity, they come to this at last, that they blaspheme the Creator,
          and disallow the salvation of God's workmanship, which the flesh truly
          is; on behalf of which I have proved, in a variety of ways, that the
          Son of God accomplished the whole dispensation [of mercy], and have
          shown that there is none other called God by the Scriptures except the
          Father of all, and the Son, and those who possess the adoption.
