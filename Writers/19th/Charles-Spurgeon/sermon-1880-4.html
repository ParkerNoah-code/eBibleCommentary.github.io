        <p>|My soul doth magnify the Lord.| -- Luke 1:46.</p>
        <p>
          MARY HAD RECEIVED a wonderful intimation from heaven of which she
          herself scarcely understood the full length and breadth. Her faith had
          apprehended a great promise, which as yet her mind hardly
          comprehended. Her prayer, |Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto
          me according to thy word,| showed her joyful submission and childlike
          confidence, and this made her blessed with the blessedness of patient
          hope. Under divine guidance she made a speedy journey into the hill
          country to see her cousin Elisabeth, and from her she received a
          confirmation of the wonderful tidings which the angel had brought to
          her. Elizabeth herself had been favored from above, for the Lord had
          looked upon her, and taken away from her the reproach of barrenness.
          Amongst other choice words, Elizabeth said to her, |Blessed is she
          that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which
          were told her from the Lord.| When Mary had thus been comforted by her
          friend, and her spirit had been elevated, and her confidence
          confirmed, she began to sing unto the Lord most sweetly, saying, |My
          soul doth magnify the Lord.| Now, if it is a good time with any of you
          -- if in communion with some older believer your confidence has been
          strengthened, make sure that the Lord has a return for it. When your
          own heart is lifted up, then lift up the name of the Lord. Exalt him
          when he exalts you. You will perhaps tell me that the Virgin had very
          especial reason for magnifying the Lord, and I answer, Assuredly she
          had. |Blessed is she among women,| and we are not backward to own the
          eminent honor which was put upon her. Blessed indeed she was, and
          highly favored. But yet, is there any true believer who has not also
          received special favor of the Lord? Sitting down quietly in our
          chamber, can we not each one say that the Lord has favored him or her
          with some special token of divine love? I think there is something
          about each believer's case which renders it special. We are none of us
          exactly like our brethren, for the manifestations of divine grace are
          very various; and there are some bright lines about your case,
          brother, which will be seen nowhere else, and some peculiar
          manifestations about your happiness, my sister, of which no one else
          can tell. I might not be straining words if I were to say to many a
          sister in Christ here, |Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord
          is with thee: blessed art thou among women.| And I might say the same
          to many a brother here: |Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord
          is with thee: blessed art thou among men. The Lord hath done great
          things for thee, and let thy spirit be glad.| True, there is one point
          in which we cannot be compared to Mary literally. She was to be the
          mother of the human nature of our Lord; but there is a parallel case
          in each one of us in which a higher mystery -- a more spiritual
          mystery -- gives us a like privilege, for, behold, the Holy Ghost
          dwells in each believer. He lives within us as within a temple, and
          reigns within us as in a palace. If we be partakers of the Holy Ghost,
          what more can we desire by way of favor from God, and what greater
          honor can be bestowed upon us? It was by her that the Word became
          incarnate, but so also is it by us, for we can make God's Word stand
          out visibly in our lives. It is ours to turn into actual, palpable
          existence among the sons of men the glorious Spirit of grace and truth
          which we find in the Word of God. Truly did our Lord speak when he
          said to his disciples, |These are my mother, and sister, and brother.|
          We bear as close a relationship to Christ as did the Virgin mother,
          and we in some sense take the same position spiritually which she took
          up corporeally in reference to him. May he be formed in us the hope of
          glory, and may it be ours to tend his infant cause in the world, and
          watch over it as a nurse does over a child, and spend our life and
          strength in endeavoring to bring that infant cause to maturity, even
          though a sword should pass through our own heart while we cherish the
          babe.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, having introduced to you her magnificat, we will dwell upon
          these words, |My soul doth magnify the Lord,| and I do earnestly hope
          that many of us can adopt the language without being guilty of
          falsehood: we can as truly say as Mary did, |My soul doth magnify the
          Lord.| If there are any of you present to-night who cannot say it, get
          to your chambers, fall upon your knees, and cry to the Lord to help
          you to do so; for as long as a man cannot magnify God he is not fit
          for heaven, where the praises of God are the eternal occupation of all
          the blessed spirits. If you cannot magnify God, it probably is because
          you are magnifying yourself. May the Lord cut self down and make
          nothing of you, and then you will make everything of him. When you
          sink in your own estimation, then will God rise in your esteem. May
          God the Holy Ghost make it so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Touching these words, I notice that, first, our text suggests to us
          AN OCCUPATION FOR ALL GRACIOUS PEOPLE: |My soul doth magnify the
          Lord.| Here is an occupation for all of us who know the Lord, and have
          been born into his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, it is an occupation which may be followed by all sorts of
          people. This humble woman speaks of her low estate, and yet she could
          magnify the Lord. All believers, of every rank and condition, can
          attend to this work. There are some things that you cannot do, but
          this one thing every gracious heart can do, and should delight to do,
          namely, to magnify the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an occupation which can be followed in all places. You need
          not go up to the meeting-house to magnify the Lord, you can do it at
          home: you need not step out of your own quiet little room, for you may
          sit still, and all alone you may magnify the Lord. You may be tossed
          about upon the sea in a storm, but you may trust his name, and be
          calm, and so magnify him. Or, you may be no traveler, and never go a
          hundred yards out of the village in which you were born, but you may
          magnify the Lord just as well for all that.
        </p>
        <p>|Where'er we seek him he is found,</p>
        <p>And every place is hallowed ground|;</p>
        <p>
          and in every place this hallowed occupation may be carried out, and we
          may always say -- at least the place will not prevent our saying, |My
          soul doth magnify the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not an occupation which requires a crowded congregation, it
          can be fitly performed in solitude. I suppose that this sonnet of the
          Virgin was sung with only one to hear it, her cousin Elisabeth. There
          is a quorum for God's praise even where there is only one; but, where
          there are two that agree to praise God, then is the praise exceeding
          sweet. Ah, my dear sisters, you will never stand up to speak to
          thousands, and many of my brethren now present would be very timid if
          they had to praise the Lord before a score. Never mind about that.
          Praise does not require even two or three, but in the quiet of the
          night, or in the loneliness of the wood far away from the haunts of
          men, your soul may pursue this blessed task, and daily, hourly,
          constantly sing -- | My soul doth magnify the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an occupation also, dear friends, which requires no money.
          Mary was a poor maiden. She had no gold or silver, and yet did she
          sweetly say, |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| It is an honorable thing
          to be entrusted with this world's treasure to lay it out for Jesus.
          The church has its temporal needs, and happy is that man who is
          privileged to supply them: but this kind of work can be followed by
          the child who has no money, and by the workwoman who scarcely knows
          how to find herself in bread. It may be followed by the poor man
          reduced to the workhouse; and by the poor woman who lies in the
          infirmary breathing out her life. |My soul doth magnify the Lord,| is
          as fit for paupers as for peers. Oh! these are golden notes, and those
          that use them have golden mouths, as golden as Chrysostom of old, even
          though they have to say, |Silver and gold have I none.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is an occupation, dear friends, which I commend to all here
          present, because it does not require great talent. A simpleton may
          sing |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| We have each one a soul, and
          when that soul has been renewed by grace it can follow this blessed
          pursuit of magnifying the Lord, Perhaps you have not the abilities of
          Mary, for she was, doubtless, a woman of considerable culture, like
          Hannah who preceded her, whose song she partly borrowed. Hannah seems
          to me to be one of the most gifted women of the Old Testament, and to
          be worthy of more notice than is generally given to her. But if you
          could not write a hymn, if you could not compose a verse, if you have
          no ability that way, ay, and if you cannot sing -- and there are some
          of us that have such cracked voices that we never shall, and there are
          one or two brethren here who have such bad ears for time that I
          generally hear them a note behind everybody else, as I did to-night --
          well, never mind about that, our souls can magnify the Lord. It is an
          occupation that does not depend upon the voice, or upon any kind of
          talent whatever. Those who sing worst to the ear of man may, perhaps,
          sing best to the ear of God; and those who have the least apparent
          ability may, from the warmth of their heart and the ardor of their
          devotion, really have the greatest capacity in God's judgment for
          magnifying his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| I would invite all my brothers and
          sisters here to take this for their occupation as long as they live,
          and never to cease from it. Nay, even should death for a moment
          suspend it, let them so praise God that it shall be no new work for
          them to begin again and praise him for ever in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, albeit that this magnifying of the Lord is an occupation
          to be taken up by all Christians, do not let us think little of it. To
          magnify the Lord seems to me the grandest thing we mortals do, for, as
          I have already said, it is the occupation of heaven. When the saints
          of the Most High pass into their glorified state they have nothing
          else to do but to magnify the Lord. The word signifies, to put it in a
          Saxon form instead of a Latin one, to |greaten God.| We cannot make
          him really greater, but we can show forth his greatness. We can make
          him appear greater. We can make others have greater thoughts of him,
          and that we do when we are praising him. We can ourselves try to have
          greater and yet greater thoughts of him -- make him to our
          apprehension a greater God than we once knew him to be; and this, I
          say, is no mean occupation, because it is followed in heaven by all
          redeemed and perfected spirits. Even here, it is the end of
          everything. Praying is the end of preaching, for preaching and hearing
          are nothing in themselves except men be brought to Christ and led to
          prayer. But then praying is not the end: praising is the end of
          praying. Prayer is the stalk of the wheat, but praise is the ear of
          the wheat: it is the harvest itself. When God is praised, we have come
          to the ultimatum. This is the thing for which all other things are
          designed. We are to be saved for this end, |To the praise of the glory
          of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.| We are
          not saved for our own sakes. How often does the Scripture tell us this
          in sense, and sometimes in words, |Not for your sakes do I this, saith
          the Lord God, be it known unto you; be ashamed and be confounded for
          your own ways, O house of Israel.| The glory of God is to my mind the
          highest conceivable end -- it certainly is the chief end of my being.
          So, my dear brother, if you cannot go out to preach -- if after
          looking over all your condition you feel that your sickness and other
          circumstances may excuse you from active service, and even if you are
          compelled to keep your bed, do not suppose that you are useless as to
          the highest end of your being. You may still serve it by lying upon
          the couch of pain and magnifying the Lord by patience. Have you ever
          looked at those lovely lilies which adorn our gardens with their
          golden petals and their milk-white leaves? How they praise God! And
          yet they never sing. You do not even hear a rustle, but they stand
          still and praise God by existing -- by just, as it were, enjoying the
          sun and the dew, and showing what God can do. A genuine Christian shut
          up under pain and sickness may glorify God by being his beloved child,
          by receiving the love of God, by showing in his common-place daily
          character, which is only noticeable from its holiness, what the grace
          of God can do. Oh may this be the occupation of us all since it is so
          noble a pursuit! |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| Come, what are you
          doing to-night? Have you been during this day murmuring and
          complaining and grumbling? End that, and begin praising. Some of you
          are farmers, and I have no doubt you have grumbled because of the
          weather. I do not wonder, but I hope that you will not do it any more,
          but rather believe that God knows better about skies and clods and
          clouds and crops than you do. If we had the management of the weather,
          I have no doubt we think we should do it very splendidly, but I
          question whether we should not ruin all creation. Our great Lord and
          Master knows how to manage everything. Let us cease from all criticism
          of what he does, and say, |My soul does not grumble. My soul does not
          complain; I have taken up a better business than that. My soul doth
          magnify the Lord.' That is her one engagement from which she will
          never cease.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, if you look at the text from another point of view, it
          provides for us A REMEDY FOR SELF-CONGRATULATION.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any one of us had been favored, as the Virgin was, with the promise
          that we should become the parent of the Savior, do you not think that
          we should have felt exceedingly lifted up? It was natural that she
          should be proud, but it was gracious on her part that she was humble.
          Instead of magnifying herself she magnified the Lord. It was a great
          thing, and somebody must be magnified for it. Nature would have said,
          |Mary, magnify thyself|; but grace said, |Mary, magnify the Lord.| If
          the Lord has been very gracious to any one of us, our only way to
          escape from vain-glorious pride, which will be exceedingly wicked if
          we indulge in it, is by giving vent to our feelings in quite another
          direction. Do you notice how she sets off the greatness of God by her
          own insignificance? |He that is mighty hath done to me great things.|
          |To me,| she says. |They are great things, and he is mighty, but they
          are to me. He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.| Over
          against the greatness of God's goodness to you be sure to set in
          contrast your own meanness and unworthiness. Has the Lord redeemed
          you, called you, justified you, sanctified you, set you in his church,
          and given you a name and a place among his people? When you are
          inclined to run up the topgallants, and to hang out all the flags, and
          to glory in your flesh, recollect who you are and what you are, and
          the hole of the pit whence you were drawn, and the rock out of which
          you were hewn, and say, |Why me, Lord? Why me?| Begin to magnify the
          name of the Lord, and that will be a death-blow to the temptation to
          pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary had a specialty: no one else should be the mother of our Lord:
          but so have we. Electing love has pitched on us. Many have been passed
          by, but the Lord has loved us with a special love; yet we cannot
          rejoice in it so as to glory in ourselves, for this election is
          according to his sovereign will, and not of ourselves. It is all of
          grace and free favor, and not according to merit. Hence my soul doth
          magnify the Lord for everlasting love and special redemption. Whence
          is this to me? What am I, and what is my father's house, that thou, O
          Lord, shouldst choose me?
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary knew also that she was to be famous. |All generations shall call
          me blessed.| But do notice how she balances her fame with another
          fame. She says, |Holy is his name, and his mercy is on them that fear
          him.| She magnifies the name of the Lord. If he has given her a
          measure of honor, she lays it at his feet. Mind you do the same. Be
          not so vain as to be lifted up with a little success. We have all
          passed through this test of character, and in the fining-pot how few
          of us have borne the fire without loss! Perhaps you have preached a
          sermon and God has blessed it; the congregation is increased, and
          crowds are gathering; the probability is that the devil whispers, |You
          are a capital preacher. Well done! You put your point admirably: God
          is blessing you. There must be something admirable in your character
          and abilities.| Away, away, thou fiend of the pit! This is ruinous
          pride! But suppose, dear brother, that the fiend will not go away
          while he finds you musing upon your success, what are you to do? Try
          him with this -- |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| Praise the name of
          the Lord that ever he should make use of such a poor, unsuitable
          instrument as yourself. Give him all the honor and all the glory, if
          honor and glory there be, and see if the arch-enemy does not take to
          flight, for God's praises are abhorrent to the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          In whatever capacity you are serving the Lord, if he puts any honor
          upon you, mind you give it all back to him. Sedulously and carefully
          endeavor to do this, for robbery here will be fatal; he will not give
          his glory to another. If we begin to pilfer even a little of the
          praise, we shall find that our Master will reckon us to be unfaithful
          stewards, and give us a discharge. If we glory in our strength, we may
          have to go out and shake ourselves like Samson when his hair was lost,
          because the Lord has taken our strength away from us. A heart that is
          lifted up with self-esteem will soon be cast down in the mire. Mary
          knew that God's favors are given to us, not that we may congratulate
          ourselves, but that we may worship him; and she acted accordingly. If
          grace be come to thee, my brother, it is a wanton waste of it to pride
          thyself upon it. Like the manna in the Israelite's house when kept
          till the morning, it will breed worms and stink: no worm ever brought
          swifter decay than pride. Bear the shield of thine honor as an
          armor-bearer for thy Lord, Know that thou hast nothing but what
          belongs to him. Use all for him, and glorify him for all, and in all;
          and so wilt thou do well. I recommend the text, then, as a cure for
          pride: |My soul doth magnify the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, and I will be brief on each point, the text is A
          FRUITFUL UTTERANCE FOR HOLY FEELINGS. |My soul doth magnify the Lord,|
          is evidently the overflow of a full soul.

          There must have been great mixture of feeling in the heart of this
          holy woman; but these few words furnished expression for every variety
          of her emotions. Those feelings were of an opposite character, and yet
          they all spoke by this one sentence. It is clear that she was filled
          with wonder. Her thoughtful spirit asked, how can so great a thing be
          true to me? Shall the Son of the Highest be born of Mary, the village
          maiden? Oh, miracle of condescension! With the amazement there was
          mingled, not the unbelief which too often comes of wonder, but an
          expectation of the promised marvel. She believed that the things which
          were spoken to her would be performed by the Lord, and she looked that
          God should keep his word to her. How sweetly those two feelings,
          wonder and expectation, are blended, hidden away and yet expressed, in
          these few words, |My soul doth magnify the Lord|! It is as though she
          had said, |I cannot understand the favor promised me. How glorious in
          his grace is the Lord my God! But I expect the blessing: I am sure of
          it, for the Lord is true! So I praise him concerning it.| The sentence
          is tinged with two fair colors, the vermilion of wonder and the azure
          of hope, and they meet harmoniously upon the same ground. The words
          are wonderful on that account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now take two other mental states. The first would be her believing.
          She was not like Zacharias, who needed to be struck dumb because he
          doubted the word of the Lord. Mary had faith, and yet, at the same
          time she must have been awe-stricken by the revelation. That she
          should give birth to the Son of the Highest must have utterly abashed
          and overwhelmed her. Now both these states of mind are here -- faith
          and awe. Faith says, |I know that the angel's message is true, and
          therefore my soul doth magnify the Lord.| Awe says, |What a solemn
          thing it is that God should come to dwell in my breast! My soul doth
          magnify the Lord.| Thus in these words confidence and reverence have
          met together, assurance and adoration have kissed each other. Here is
          faith with its familiarity, and devotion with its godly fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, also, you very clearly perceive two other holy emotions. Her
          humility is apparent, and in the text it seems to ask the question,
          |How can this happen to me? How can it be that such a poor woman,
          affianced to a humble carpenter, should be the mother of my Lord?|
          Humility sheds its perfume here, like a violet hidden away. She seems
          to say, |Not unto me, not unto me be the glory! My soul doth magnify
          the Lord.| But that humility is not of the cringing and crouching kind
          which draws back from God, for it is clearly mixed with love. |I
          rejoice in my gracious Lord,| she seems to say, |I bless him: I love
          him: I praise him. My soul doth magnify the Lord. I am not worthy of
          his promised visitation, but it will be mine, and infinite
          condescension will do this thing unto me. Therefore do I love my God,
          and I draw near to him. My soul doth magnify the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Brothers and sisters, you will often find the language of my text the
          most expressive of utterances for all that is good in your minds. Many
          sweet passions, like little birds, may fold their wings, and dwell
          together in this one well-compacted nest, -- |My soul doth magnify the
          Lord,| Holy emotions may fly hither in swarms, and make the text like
          a hive of bees, stored with honey. As I turn and think it over, it
          sheds abroad its own spirit within me, as spices breathe out their own
          perfume, and I cry, |My soul doth magnify him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I perceive in these words a singular mixture of admiration and
          calm thought: a wonder in which there is no surprise. The blessed
          Virgin is evidently, as I have said before, wonder-struck that such a
          thing should come to her, and yet there is about that wonder no
          startling of amazement, but a marvelling which is the result of
          previous careful thought. She had considered the prophecies and
          promises, and saw them about to be fulfilled in her seed. She sang in
          the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth verses, |He hath holpen his servant
          Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; as he spake to our fathers, to
          Abraham, and to his seed for ever.| She had turned over the subject in
          her mind, and she came to the conclusion, |He has said he will do
          this. It is as he spake.| So, oftentimes, when you get a mercy given
          to you, you will be surprised at it at first, but afterwards you will
          say, |This is even as the Lord promised to me. He doeth no new thing
          to his servant. It is only my forgetfulness that has made me to be
          astonished. Did he not promise that he would help me -- that he would
          deliver me -- that he would give me all that I needed? And inasmuch as
          he has done it in this surprising way, my soul doth magnify him twice
          over for the wonderful mercy, and for the faithfulness of his covenant
          love which kept the ancient promise which he made to be yea and amen
          in Christ Jesus.| Again, I say, I commend the text as an expression of
          your feelings. How sweet are the words, |My soul doth magnify the
          Lord|! They are full, many-sided, and natural, and yet most spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Fourthly, I think my text may be used as A REASON FOR HOPEFULNESS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be well to be wrapped up in this spirit with regard to
          everything. The mood which bids us sing |My soul doth magnify the
          Lord| is full of a hope which will be useful in a thousand ways. For
          instance, concerning our own providential condition, let us magnify
          the Lord. Surrounded with difficulties, let us walk on with
          confidence, because our great God is equal to every emergency, and can
          both level the mountains and fill up the valleys. Burdened with labors
          and stripped by necessities, let us maintain an unchanging
          cheerfulness, because we magnify the might and the bounty of the
          eternal Jehovah, whose name is God All-sufficient. When danger is
          magnified by fear, let God be magnified by faith. When the troubles of
          our heart are enlarged, let our expectations from the Lord be enlarged
          also.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same God-magnifying spirit should attend our glances into
          futurity, if we indulge in any, and we are all too apt to do so. Ah!
          we would like to know, some of us, what is going to happen to us. Fain
          would we steal a glance behind the screen, and each one see
        </p>
        <p>|What gloomy lines are writ for me,</p>
        <p>Or what dark scenes arise|</p>
        <p>
          There is a desire in most persons' minds to draw away the curtain
          which God has so wisely placed over the future. This is very wrong of
          us, and yet it is as common as it is blamable. We all turn prophets
          every now and then, and when we do we prophesy evil, and therefore it
          would be well if we could catch the spirit of Mary with regard to our
          forecasts of the future, and say, |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| Why
          do we set our blear-eyed anxieties to watch the signs of heaven? If we
          must pry, and guess, and speculate, why not employ our brighter
          powers, and let blue-eyed hope scan the ensigns of the sky? When we
          meddle with the future how dare we foretell that which would dishonor
          the Lord? If we must needs write bitter things against ourselves, yet
          we ought not to write untruthful things against him. When we do
          forecast the future at all, let us do it in the spirit wherewith we
          sing, |My soul doth magnify the Lord.| Let us be certain that we shall
          find him to be a great God in the future, greatly good, wondrously
          gracious, magnifying his mercy. We shall have troubles, but our soul
          doth magnify the Lord, for she foresees that we shall ride out all
          storms with Jesus at the helm, and come safe into port. Our anxious
          eye foresees necessities, but our soul doth magnify the Lord, for she
          sees him with a golden key opening the treasures of David, and
          supplying all her wants. Our troubled car can hear the wolf, but our
          soul doth magnify the Lord, for she sings, |The Lord is my Shepherd,
          and he will preserve me.| In this spirit you may look forward to the
          swellings of Jordan, magnifying the living God while you yourself lie
          down to die. If you faint and begin to say, |Ah! I shall never be able
          to die triumphantly,| you are minimizing, and not magnifying, the
          Lord. You are making him little, and not great. Try and say, |How
          marvellously will he show his grace to me, a dying worm! Oh, how
          wondrous he will be in the eyes of angels that will crowd the banks
          to' hear a poor trembling soul like me go singing through the stream!
          My God will be great in that day; then will he lay bare his arm, and
          therefore will I fear no evil, for he will be with me; his rod and his
          staff will comfort me.| Think great things of God. Greaten God.
          Magnify his name whenever you look forward to the future. Chase from
          your mind any imagination or foreboding which would detract from the
          greatness or the goodness of your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge in the same manner with regard to the salvation of your
          fellow-men. Never say, |It is of no use inducing such a man to attend
          the means of grace. He is a blaspheming wretch. All that he would do
          if he heard a sermon would be to make sport of it for the next week. I
          have no faith in taking such a man to hear a ministry which he would
          be sure to ridicule.| Such unbelieving talk is making little of God.
          Is it not so? Is it not dishonoring God to think that his gospel
          cannot reach the most depraved hearts? Why, if I knew that a man had
          seven thousand devils in him, I believe the gospel could drive them
          all out. Get the sinners under the sound of the word, and the worse
          they are, oftentimes, the more does God love to display the greatness
          of his grace in casting down the power of their sin. Believe great
          things of God. I can honestly say this -- that since God saved me I
          never doubted his power to save anybody. All things are possible now
          that he has brought me to his feet, and kept me these years as his
          loving child. I must think great things of God who has done such great
          things for so great a sinner as I am. Greaten God, my brethren;
          greaten God. Believe great things of him. Believe that China can be
          made into a province of the celestial kingdom. Believe that India will
          cast her riches at Jesus' feet. Believe that the round world will yet
          be a pearl on Christ's finger-ring. Do not go in for the dispiriting,
          despairing, unmanly, un-Christly ideas of those who say, |The world is
          not to be converted. It is a poor wreck that will go to pieces, and we
          are to fish off here and there one from the water-logged hulk.|
          Brethren, never believe that we are to stand by and see the eternal
          defeat of God. Deem not that our God is unable to win upon the old
          lines, and must needs shift the plan of the campaign. It shall never
          be said that God could not save the world by the preaching of the
          gospel, and by the work of the Holy Spirit, and therefore must needs
          bring in the advent of the Lord to do it. I believe in the coming of
          the Lord, but, blessed be his name, I believe also that the battle
          which he has begun in the Spirit he will fight out in the old style,
          and finish with a victory in the very manner in which he opened the
          conflict. It pleases him by the foolishness of preaching to save them
          that believe, and it will please him to continue to do so till the
          whole round earth shall ring with hallelujahs of praise to the grace
          of God, who by the feeblest of his creatures shall have defeated sin,
          and death, and hell. Do not get into a desponding state of mind, and
          rush into half-insane theories of prophecy in order to excuse your
          unbelief and idleness. Never throw down your weapons, and pretend that
          the victory is to be won by doting and dreaming: we are to fight to
          the end with the same weapons, and in the same name. We will drive the
          devil out of the world yet, by the grace of God, by the old, efficient
          weapons of the Word of God and the Spirit of God. Greaten God, and
          magnify his name, by believing in the success of the gospel of his
          dear Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the nearer future, never believe any human prophecy that does
          not glorify God. Expect great things of God, and if you hear any
          prediction that is not to the glory of God, conclude that it is a
          blunder. |Oh!| said one to me, |this country will go back to Romanism:
          the gospel light will be quenched in England.| Ah, dear me! Some
          brethren are mightily fond of this prognostication. But, my dear
          friend, there is one thing that always comforts me, namely, that God
          is not dead: and he is not going to be defeated by the pope of Rome,
          or fifty popes of Rome. He will win the victory yet. Always have
          courage, for it is God's cause, and it is in God's hands, and, being
          in God's hands, it is safe enough. See what you do: -- because you
          cannot trust God's hand you trust your own! You thrust out your
          sacrilegious arm to interfere with God's peculiar work. What are you
          at? You are about to defile God's ark. Recollect the story of Uzzah.
          Pluck your hand back, and leave the ark alone. The Lord will help you
          to do such work as he gives you to do, but he has not made you Lord of
          empires, nor director of providence. Leave to his sovereign sway the
          purposes of his eternal grace, and depend upon it he will bring the
          world to Jesus' feet. Christ himself shall come: be you looking for
          him every day, but be constant in his service, working for him every
          hour. Believe, too, that he shall reign amongst his ancients
          gloriously, and where amidst Judea's glades Christ has been dishonored
          and the false prophet has ruled, there too shall he reign, and Jew and
          Gentile shall worship and adore his ever-blessed name. I say again,
          magnify the Lord with all your souls. Greaten God. Expect great things
          in the future, and with the cheery note of confidence go forward to
          battle for him whose is the victory for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Once more, and I have done. Our text should be used as a GUIDE IN
          OUR THEOLOGY. We will finish with that. Here is a very useful test for
          young disciples who are beginning to study God's word. |My soul doth
          magnify the Lord.| If you will carry this with you it will often save
          you from error, and guide you into truth. There is certain teaching
          which makes a great deal of man: it talks much of man's free-will,
          ability, capacity, and natural dignity. It evidently makes man the
          center and end of all things, and God is placed in a position of
          service to his creature. As for the Fall: father Adam slipped and
          broke his little finger, or something of the kind, but this theology
          sees no great ruin as the result of the fall. As for salvation: it is
          a slight cure for a small ill, and by no means the infinite grace
          which we consider it to be. Dear brethren, let those have this
          theology who like it, but do not you touch it even with a pair of
          tongs. It is of no use to man, for it mistakes his position, and only
          ministers to his pride. Man's place is not on the throne, but at the
          foot of the cross. Listen to another theology, in which the sinner is
          laid low, his sinfulness is exposed, his corruption is unfolded,
          Christ's redemption is magnified, free grace is extolled, and the Holy
          Ghost is adored. That is the theology for you, believe it: that is the
          theology of the Scriptures, accept it. I do not think that you will
          often be led wrong if this be your mode of judgment: that which
          glorifies God is true, and that which does not glorify God is false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you will meet with an undoubted teaching of God's word which
          you do not understand. You know that the doctrine is taught in the
          word, but you cannot make it coincide with some other truth, and you
          cannot quite see, perhaps, how it glorifies God. Then, dear brother,
          dear sister, glorify God by believing it. To believe a doctrine which
          you see to be true by mere reason is nothing very wonderful. There is
          no very great glory to God in believing what is as clear as the sun in
          the heavens; but to believe a truth when it staggers you -- oh,
          gracious faith! oh, blessed faith! You will perhaps remember an
          illustration taken from Mr. Gough, where the little boy says, |If
          mother says it is so, it is so if it is not so.| That is the kind of
          believing for a child towards its mother, and that is the sort of
          believing we ought to exercise towards God. I do not see the fact, and
          I cannot quite apprehend it, but God says it is so, and I believe him.
          If all the philosophers in the world should contradict the Scriptures,
          so much the worse for the philosophers; their contradiction makes no
          difference to our faith. Half a grain of God's word weighs more with
          us than a thousand tons of words or thoughts of all the modern
          theologians, philosophers, and scientists that exist on the face of
          the earth; for God knows more about his own works than they do. They
          do but think, but the Lord knows. With regard to truths which
          philosophers ought not to meddle with, because they have not specially
          turned their thoughts that way, they are not more qualified to judge
          than the poorest man in the church of God, nay, nor one-half so much.
          Inasmuch as the most learned unregenerate men are dead in sin, what do
          they know about the living things of the children of Cod? Instead of
          setting them to judge we will sooner trust our boys and girls that are
          just converted, for they do know something of divine things, but
          carnal philosophers know nothing of them. Do not be staggered,
          brothers and sisters, but honor God, glorify God, and magnify him by
          believing great things and unsearchable -- past your finding out --
          which you know to be true because he declares them to be so. Let the
          ipse dixit of God stand to you in the place of all reason, being
          indeed the highest and purest reason, for God, the Infallible, speaks
          what must be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, I come back to where I started. Let us go forth and
          practically try to magnify the name of the Lord. Go home and speak
          well of his name: gather your children together and tell them what a
          good and great God he has been. Some of you who have a swarm of
          youngsters could not do better than spend half an hour in telling them
          of his goodness to you in all your times of trouble. Leave to your
          children the heirloom of gratitude. Tell them how good the Lord was to
          their father, and how good he will be to his children: tell your
          servants, tell your work-people, tell anybody with whom you come in
          contact what a blessed God the Lord is. For my part, I never can speak
          well enough of his adorable name. He is the best of masters, his
          service is delight; he is the best of fathers, his commands are
          pleasure. Was there ever such a god as our God, our enemies themselves
          being judges?
        </p>
        <p>
          Magnify his name by the brightness of your countenances. Rejoice and
          be glad in him. When you are in sorrow and must needs fast, yet appear
          not unto men to fast, but anoint your faces and still wear a smile.
          Let not the world think that the servants of a king go mourning all
          their days. Make the world feel what a great God you serve, and what a
          blessed Savior Christ is, and thus evermore let your soul magnify the
          Lord. God grant you grace to do so, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

        <p>HYMNS FROM |Our Own Hymn Book| -- 174, 775.</p>
        <p>LETTER FROM MR. SPURGEON.</p>
        <p>
          Dear Friends, -- Your continued prayers are sought for the special
          services at the tabernacle, that by their success any injury occurring
          through the pastor's enforced absence may be remedied. It would be an
          affliction indeed if our life-work should suffer through painful
          sickness, which in itself is a heavy cross to bear. By your prayers
          this will be averted, and the trial will be turned into a blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right thankful am I to report rapid, and I trust real, progress in my
          own case. Living in an unbroken series of summer days, where no cold
          mists are dreamed of, it is no great marvel that rheumatic pains fly
          away, and depression of spirit departs. The healing Lord has breathed
          a restoring influence over land, and sea, and sky, and I am feeling it
          to my great joy. Hoping soon to be among my own people, and to issue
