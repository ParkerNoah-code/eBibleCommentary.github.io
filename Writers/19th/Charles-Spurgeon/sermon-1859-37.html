        <p>A Sermon</p>

        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 10th, 1859, by the</p>

        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          |By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
          should after receive for an inheritance obeyed; and he went out, not
          knowing whither he went.| -- Hebrews 11:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          ABRAHAM'S FAITH was of the most eminent order, for he is called the
          Father of the Faithful. Let us rest assured that nothing but repeated
          and fiery trials could have trained his faith to so great a strength
          as that which it exhibited in his preparation to slay his son at the
          command of God. This true Jerusalem blade was long annealed before it
          gained its marvellous edge and matchless temper. Men come not to their
          perfect stature except by years of growth. Stars cannot reach the
          zenith of the heavens by one sudden flash, nay even the sun himself
          must climb to his meridian. Trials are the winds which root the tree
          of our faith. They are the trainers, drilling God's young soldiers,
          and teaching their hands to war and their fingers to fight. Foremost
          among Abraham's trials was that of being called away to a land which
          he had never been; as this may be our trial also, I pray that my words
          may be adapted to our present condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, let us LOOK AT ABRAHAM. Abraham's family was originally an
          idolatrous one; afterwards some beams of light shone in upon the
          household, and they became worshippers of the true God; but there was
          much ignorance mingled with their worship, and at least occasionally
          their old idolatrous habits returned. The Lord who had always fixed on
          Abraham to be his chosen servant and the father of his chosen people
          upon earth, made Abraham leave the society of his friends and
          relatives, and go out of Ur of the Chaldees, and journey away to the
          land of Canaan, which be had promised afterwards to give him for an
          inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall notice first what Abraham left, and then where Abraham went;
          the trial is made up of these two things. What had he to leave? He had
          to leave behind him those who were exceeding dear to him. It is true
          that just after his first call, his own father, Terah, died, having
          gone a part of the way with Abraham and detained Abraham a little
          while by sickness. Abraham then went on his way obedient to the Lord's
          command. Nevertheless, he left behind him all the associationof his
          youth, the house in which he had been trained, the family with which
          he had been nursed, all those whom he had known and with whom he had
          taken sweet counsel; and he must go forth into exile from the family
          of his love. He left behind him his native country, and to a patriot
          that is no small struggle -- to leave all the associations of one's
          country, and bear with us one's native songs to be sung in distant
          valleys. Many a man has felt keenly enough the separation from home
          and kindred, and next to that, the sad banishment from his native
          land. Besides, we all know with what inconvenience Abraham must have
          removed. He had a considerable property in flocks and herds, and
          probably had the ancestral dwelling house in which to reside. He must
          leave all these, and he must also leave the fair pastures wherein his
          flocks and his father's flocks had been fed, and he must wend his way
          into the wilderness. He must give up all agricultural pursuits,
          renounce his vine and his fig tree, and go his way, he knew not
          whither, to a land which to him was as unknown as the valley of the
          shadow of death. Whose of you who have had to part from those you
          loved, who have had your hearts rent when loved ones have been torn
          away, can sympathize somewhat with Abraham's trial when he left home
          and family, and country, and all, to go forth into an unknown land.
          This is the place from which he went.
        </p>
        <p>
          How, let us turn to the place to which he journeyed. When men
          emigrate, they, wish to know the nature of the country in which they
          are to live. If it be a richer country than their own, although it be
          with some reluctance, they spread the sail and speed across the
          waters; and it may be, after they have settled there a little while,
          their mother country is almost forgotten, and they find a settled
          dwelling-place in their adopted land. But Abraham knew nothing of the
          country to which he was about to move; be had simply God's promise
          that it should be his inheritance. It was, it might be said, a wild
          goose chase, and the profane would deride it as a mad and idle dream.
          Doubtless, the prudent father cautioned him to avoid so great a risk,
          and the anxious mother bade him remember that, as a bird wandereth
          from his nest, so is he that leaveth his place. But amidst all this,
          Abraham was wiser than the wisest, for he put aside all worldly
          maxims, he set the precept above the maxim, and considered the promise
          more precious than the proverb. Well was it for Abraham that he knew
          that the wise things of men are often ignorance dressed out in its
          best clothes. It has been said by an acute old writer, that when
          Christ came into Jerusalem -- and he was incarnate wisdom -- he came
          riding upon an ass; but when Satan came into paradise -- and he is
          infernal folly -- he came in the shape of a wise creature, the subtle
          serpent. Wisdom came riding upon stupidity, and folly came in the
          garments of craftiness; We shall often find it so in our lives.
          Simplicities are next akin to revelations. Plain simple things, and
          especially a plain simple obedience, are next akin to the very wisdom
          of the seer; and he who knoweth how to read the precept need not be
          afraid that the prophecy will ever contradict it, or render obedience
          to the precept an act of folly. Abraham then went forth, he knew not
          whither. |The journey is a long one,| say some timid ones. |It is so,|
          said Abraham, |but God will help me on the way.| |The end of your
          journey may be doleful,| they say. |No,| caith Abraham, |it cannot be
          doleful; it may be disappointing to my worldly ambition, but not to my
          faith. I believe that God will be with me, and that take me where he
          may, I shall lack no good thing.| So Abraham went on his way along
          alone and weary journey, and God did not desert him, but graciously
          provided for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spoken to you of what Abraham left, and whither he went; now I
          would have you observe for a moment how it was that Abraham went. It
          is said that when he was commanded, he obeyed. Ere the precept had
          gone forth, obedience had come forth to meet it with rejoicing. God
          had scarcely spoken ere Abraham replied. Just as the thunder followeth
          the lightning's flash, instanter, when the storm is near, so when
          faith is near, the thunder of our obedience follows the mighty flash
          of God's influence in our hearts. If God bids us do, we should do at
          once. Abraham went without any hesitation. He did not say, |Lord give
          me a little time: I will go in a week. Suffer me first to go and bury
          my father.| I do not find that he said, |Lord let me tarry till
          harvest be reaped.| No, he was commanded to go, and he went without
          hesitation. There were no carnal arguments between God and Abraham,
          for God has not invited his people to reason with him with human
          arguments. He has invited sinners to do it. -- |Come now and let us
          reason together,| he has said. When men have no faith, God invites
          them to reason, but when they have faith, reasoning with God becomes a
          sin. Abraham asked no question: he was not like Moses: he did not say,
          |Who am I that thou shouldest send me;| but when he was commanded to
          go, he went and he followed God without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then again, we have every reason to believe that he obeyed without
          reluctance. He went as cheerfully away from his father's house as he
          had ever gone into it. I know not that he was sent away with the voice
          of tabret and of harp, but I am sure there was the voice of music in
          his heart. He might have said, |I go as cheerfully to-day I know not
          where, as ever I have gone to the fat land of Egypt or the
          spice-bearing country of the Sabeans.| Men said his journey was absurd
          and deplorable, but to him it was the happiest and the best, for God
          was with him; and if the star did not guide him as it did the wise men
          to Bethlehem, yet there was a star within his own soul that shone like
          a sun, and lightened his footsteps and cheered his spirit, and sent
          him on his joyous way towards his appointed habitation. He went
          cheerfully, not knowing whither he went, not starting and fretting
          like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, but running with willing
          footsteps in the way of God. The ancients pictured Mercury with wings
          upon its heels, and surely faith hath them there.
        </p>
        <p>|Tis love that makes our willing feet</p>
        <p>In swift obedience move.|</p>
        <p>
          Love may be the wings, but the wings are upon the feet of faith, and
          it flies to do the will of God whilst hearkening to his commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, then, notice that when Abraham started he made no stipulations
          with his Lord. If God had commanded Abraham to go to the utmost bounds
          of the green earth, to |rivers unknown to song,| Abraham would have
          departed. If God had commanded him to ford the Atlantic, Abraham would
          have obeyed. His feet would have been willing to attempt a miracle,
          and the stormy billows would have been dry before his march. We may
          rest assured that when Abraham started, he asked no questions
          concerning how far or to what place he was journeying. He left that
          all in the hands of God. His faith put its hand inside the hand of its
          father, and he was content to be led wherever his father would lead
          him. Now, it is always foolish in us to be led by man, for then |the
          blind lead the blind, and both fall into the ditch;| but for the blind
          to be led by God is one of the best and wisest things. We sometimes
          put blinkers upon horses that they may not see too much, I fear we
          might wear such things ourselves to great advantage. In watching with
          the eyes of carnal reason for objections to God's precept and
          providence, it would be well if our eyes were burnt out, for better
          for us to enter into life having no eyes than having two eyes to
          follow our own devices and find our end destruction in hell fire.
          Abraham's faith, then, was a tried one. Add now I conclude this sketch
          of the Patriarch's call, by observing that Abraham's faith was well
          rewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think with all the trials of Abraham, you and I might even envy his
          position. That tent of his was a royal tent. Never did the curtains of
          Solomon himself enshroud more true royalty, or kingly nobility, than
          this poor tent in which Abraham sojourned. What a blessed man was he.
          His very dreams were blessed. The Lord was his shield and his
          exceeding great reward. A land was given to him, and was it a barren
          land? No. The Jews of old used to say that Canaan was the breast of
          the world; for there was always an abundance of milk and fatness.
          Other countries might have been the world's extremities, but this was
          the world's own breast, flowing with milk and honey. God gave him from
          the river of Egypt, even to the great river -- the river Euphrates,
          and he looking from his starry height as an exalted patriarch, saw a
          race as numerous as the sand of the sea inbabiting the land. And he
          expects a mightier blessing yet. He looks for the day when the sons of
          Abraham shall at the second coming of Christ be assembled in their own
          land, and all the people shall walk in the light of Zion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have said enough about Abraham. Had my voice been strong
          enough, I could have enlarged, for it is a subject upon which much
          might be said extremely interesting to the spiritual mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now I come to observe that YOU AND I MAY BE PLACED IN THE SAME
          POSITION. At their first conversion very many of the people of God are
          called to pass through the precise trial which Abraham endured. Some
          of us, it is true, were born of pious parents, and our conversion was
          a theme of joy to the home; it made jubilee; the fatted calf was
          killed, and there was music and dancing. But others were born as
          children of the Philistines; our parents were haters of God. I may be
          addressing such. No sooner did you begin to attend the house of God,
          than your father was the first to laugh at you, and when you were
          detected on your knees, mother, and brothers, and sisters, all
          assailed you with sneers and ridicule. It may be that you have
          suffered much household persecution for the sake of Christ's cross,
          and the profession of it you have made. Moreover, you may have been
          called to separate yourself from your whole ancestry; for in looking
          back you cannot detect on the family tree one branch that ever bore
          heavenly fruit. The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.
          The whole family has been given up to Satan, and you have been called
          to bear a lonely protest to the gospel of Christ; you have come out,
          you have blighted your own worldly prospects, you have drowned your
          own interest in crossing the river. You have suffered the loss of all
          things for Christ's sake, and perhaps at the time you may have been
          greatly staggered; nay, even now you may be passing through the fiery
          trial. You may be staggering in your soul, and saying, |Can this be
          right? shall I give up my religion, shall I put back into port, or
          shall I encounter these waves that threaten to submerge my vessel?|
          Dear brothers and sisters, if father and mother forsake you, then the
          Lord will take you up. |He that loveth father and mother, and house
          and lands, more than me,| saith Christ, |is not worthy of me.| You
          must leave all for Christ's sake. Be prepared. If they will come with
          you, take their compliance gladly; if they will not, then come alone;
          |Come ye out from among them; be ye separate, touch not the unclean
          thing.| Be an Abraham. Leave everything, and if you do this in faith,
          verily ye shall not lack your reward. He is able, and he has promised
          to give you in this life ten times more than you lose for him, and in
          the world to come life everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such Christians as I have referred to, who are not called in early
          life to endure this trial, frequently have to bear its counterpart at
          another stage in their journey. On a sudden their minds are
          enlightened with regard to the pure simplicity of the gospel; their
          family is professedly religious and they have been in the habit of
          attending a certain place of worship with their kindred and friends,
          till at length a change passes over their religious views. Perhaps it
          is a doctrinal change; they have imbibed the orthodox faith from the
          pure fountain of revelation itself, unalloyed by the traditions and
          qualifications of men; they have cast away all the heterodox glossary
          of man, and have determined to believe nothing but the sovereign grace
          of God. Perhaps their views on baptism may have changed, and seeing
          nothing in Scripture to warrant infant sprinkling, they have come out
          with a determination to practice believer's baptism. It may be that
          this entails the scoff and scorn of all who know them. This grieves
          the hearts of those who know and love Jesus, and the question arises
          with them, |What shall I do?| These matters may be non-essential,
          shall I keep them back? Shall I for charity's sake weaken my
          testimony. Shall I only bear testimony to points on which I may agree
          with other people, and hold my tongue about the rest. Oh, my dear
          friends, such carnal policy, if you practice it, will do you serious
          injury. Whatever you believe, carry it out. Depend upon it a grain of
          truth is a grain of diamond dust, and it is precious. There may be
          truths non-essential to our salvation; but there are no non-essential
          truths with regard to our comfort. Every truth is essential. We must
          keep back none, but follow the Lord wholly; let this be your song, --
        </p>
        <p>|Through floods and flames, if Jesus lead,</p>
        <p>I'll follow where he goes,</p>
        <p>'Hinder me not,' shall be my cry,</p>
        <p>Though earth and hell oppose.|</p>
        <p>
          The tendency of the present age is to temporize; we are asked
          continually to qualify our testimony; to cut off some portion of the
          truth we preach; to smooth down and polish our words. God forbid; we
          will not do so. Whatever we believe to be true, to the last jot and
          tittle we will speak it out. I hope so long as I live there will
          always be a straight road from my heart to my mouth, and that I shall
          be able to preach whatever I believe in my soul, and to keep nothing
          reserved. Do you the same. Though you should forsake all, and should
          be by all forsaken, for the truth's sake, with Abraham's trial and
          Abraham's faith, you shall have Abraham's honor and Abraham's reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          How often has this temptation happened to the rich. When those who
          have moved in court circles, have suddenly become the subjects of the
          enlightening Spirit of grace, what opposition they have had to
          encounter! Many have been the noble ladies and gentlemen who have sat
          in this hall; yet, although I know many of them were impressed, how
          few of them have remained! Here and there one; they shine like the
          gleanings of the vintage. -- Here and there one upon the topmost
          boughs. And what is the reason? Is it that their consciences are
          incapable of conviction? It is simply that the cares of this life, or
          the deceitfulness of riches chokes the Word, and by-and-bye they are
          offended. It is not likely that the simple worship of our unendowed
          meeting-houses is to win the palm of courtly applause; it is not
          likely that the name of Dissenter is to be held respectable; it is not
          likely that Calvinism is to become the court religion of England; it
          is not likely, at least at present, that a poor, simple, honest man's
          ministry, will be a ministry that courtiers regard; we never expected
          it. Nevertheless, there have been some, and God bless them, who have
          not been ashamed to come out, and leave behind them their former
          associates and take part with the despised people of God, scarcely
          knowing whither they went. Though they did know we were poor, and most
          of us uneducated and illiterate, they have taken their portion with
          us, and they have shown no signs of turning back but do even glory in
          that which some count to their shame. God bless them, and that
          abundantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, this trial of faith cometh oftentimes in matters of providence.
          We have been lining our nests very softly, and counting all the eggs
          that are laid therein, with the greatest cheerfulness and delight; we
          have had much goods laid up for many years, and all of a sudden,
          Misfortune, like a wicked boy, has climbed the tree, and pulled down
          the nests, and the birds had to fly, and we have said, |Whither shall
          we go?| But God has comforted us, and we have said in our hearts,
          |Every tree in the forest of earth is doomed to the axe, why,
          therefore, should we build our nest here? Let us fly away and find our
          home in the rock of ages.| And God has rewarded our faith. Our
          business, though suddenly blighted when flourishing in one place, has
          been, when removed amidst sad misgivings and dark uncertainties, even
          more flourishing in another; or if not, if trials have multiplied and
          poverty has succeeded wealth, yet grace has increased, and as our
          afflictions abounded, our consolations have much more abounded. I
          believe, dear friends, that many and many a time you, in your
          providential journey will have to go forth, not knowing whither you
          are going. But it is good for you; do not murmur at it. If the father
          of the faithful had to do it, why should the sons murmur? The father
          of the family must not know whither he was going, and shall you, the
          sons and daughters, long to read the future with whistful curious
          eyes? No, wherever God in his providence guides you, let it be your
          joy to know that he is too wise to err -- too good to be unkind.

          And, beloved, this is what I feel at the present moment respecting the
          position of ourselves as a congregation. I was to this test by
          considering the way in which God led us, especially in reference to
          this place. It is now nearly three years since Exeter Hall was shut
          against us, for reasons which I have never considered to be fully
          justifiable. Then it was we went forth not knowing whither we went,
          and this place was prepared for us. It is more than probable that
          after two more Sabbaths have elapsed we must go forth again not
          knowing whither we shall go. But my faith is fixed upon him who has
          provided for us hitherto. This congregation cannot be scattered. God
          has gathered it, and we will go forth, being assured that a place
          shall be discovered in which we shall meet, and this shall work for
          the furtherance of the gospel, and for the glory of God. I feel that
          perhaps God has another host of sinners to be aroused and converted to
          Christ. We are getting old steady sort of folks here, and we have
          settled into a respectable concern. We may be turned into the streets,
          but, God going with us, we care not where we go. Wherever it is we
          shall be kept together; we are not men whose attachment has been
          formed hastily. We love each other. Like Abraham, and Lot and his
          family, we will journey together; we have no cause to fear. Do not, I
          entreat you, betray the slightest distress about it; if God has done
          it, he has wise purposes, let us submit in silence, and believe it
          must and shall be well. Abraham went forth |not knowing whither he
          went.| We will imitate him. While Abraham's faith is our faith
          Abraham's God is our God. He speaks and every doubt is hushed -- |Fear
          not Abraham, I am thy shield and thine exceeding great reward.| So
          then we may boldly say, |The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
          what man shall do unto me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And I thought, while meditating upon this text, that the time must
          come to each of us, when, in a certain sense, we must go forth from
          this world, not knowing the place to which we are going. The hour is
          coming when you and I shall lie low upon our silent beds of
          languishing, and the message will come -- |Arise and go forth from the
          house in which thou hast dwelt, from the city in which thou halt done
          business, from thy wife, from thy children, from thy bed, and from thy
          table. Arise and take thy last journey.| And what know I of the
          journey? A little have l read of it, and somewhat has been revested by
          the Spirit to my soul; but how little do we know of the realms of the
          future! We know there is a black and stormy river called |Death.| He
          bids me cross it. May he give me grace to go through the stream! And,
          after death, what cometh? No traveler hath returned to tell. Some say
          it is a land of confusion and of the shadow of death. Well, be it what
          it may, we will go forth, not knowing whither we go, but yet knowing
          that since he is with us, passing through the gloomy vale, we need
          fear no evil. We must be going to our Father's house, be that where it
          may. We must be going to our heavenly Father's kindly home, where
          Jesus is: to that royal city which hath foundations, whose builder and
          maker is God. This shall be our last removal, to dwell for ever with
          him we love, to dwell in the bosom of God. We will take our last
          journey, and we will not fear to take it, for God is our refuge and
          strength, our helper in the hour of trouble and of death.

          III. And now, my voice almost fails me, and therefore. I must come at
          once to the last point, which is that of EXHORTING YOU MOST CHEERFULLY
          TO FOLLOW THE GUIDE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE AND PRECEPT, LEAD IT WHEREVER
          IT MAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us follow the Shepherd, with a ready mind, because he has a
          perfect right to lead us wherever he pleases. We are not our own, we
          are bought with a price. If we were our own, Ye might repine at our
          circumstances, but since we are not, let this be our cry, |Do what
          thou wilt, O Lord, and though thou slay me, yet will I trust in thee;|
          we are not true to our profession of being Christians, if we pick and
          choose for ourselves. Picking and choosing are great enemies to
          submission. In fact, they are not at an consistent therewith. If we
          are really Christ's Christians, let us say,|It is the Lord, let him do
          what seemeth him good.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And then in the next place we ought to submit because wherever be may
          lead us, if we know not where we go, we do know one thing, we know
          with whom we go, we do not know the road, but we do know the guide. We
          may feel that the journey is long, but we are quite sure that the
          everlasting arms that carry us are strong enough, be the journey never
          so many leagues in length. We do not know what may be the inhabitants
          of the land into which we may come, Canaanites or not; but we do know
          that the Lord our God is with us, and he shall surely deliver them
          into our hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason why we should follow with simplicity and faith all the
          commands of God, is this, because we may be quite sure they shall all
          end well. They may not be well apparently while they are going on, but
          they will end well at last. You sometimes see in a factory the wheels
          running some this way, and some the other, and some crossways, and
          they seem to be playing all sorts of anticks, but somehow or other the
          deviser brings them all to work for some settled object. And I know
          that come prosperity or come adversity, come sickness or come wealth,
          come foe, come friend, come popularity, or come contempt, his purpose
          shall be worked out, and that purpose shall be pure, unmingled good to
          every blood-bought heir of mercy on whom his heart is set.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I may add, to conclude. Let us as a congregation, above all
          others, put the most implicit trust in our wonder-working God; when we
          recollect what he has already done for us, how he hath made the wrath
          of man to praise him, the contempt, the contumely, and the scorn has
          helped to bring to this place the willing thousands to hear the Word.
          The abuse of our enemies has been our best help, our grandest
          assistance; and in looking back day after day, and Sabbath after
          Sabbath. I can only hold up my hands and exclaim, |What hath God
          wrought!| And shall we doubt for the future? No; mariner, hoist the
          sail; loose the rudder bands; drag up the anchor; once again to sea we
          go, with the flag of faith at the masthead, with Jehovah at the helm,
          to a sure port the vessel shall be guided, though the storm may howl,
          and hell beneath shall be stirred; for God is with us, and the God of
          Abraham is our refuge. God give to every one of you the firmest trust
          in his providence, that you may go forth not knowing whither you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for you that believe not in God, may you be led to believe in the
          Lord Jesus Christ as in your Redeemer, and afterwards to trust your
          God, and leave al your concerns in his hands.<br />
