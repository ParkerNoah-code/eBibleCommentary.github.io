        <p>Held at New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday Night, December 31, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>
          If it be enquired why I held a Watch-night, let the answer be --
          because I hoped that the Lord would own the service, and thus souls
          might be saved. I have preached at all hours the gospel of Jesus, and
          I see no reason why I may not preach at midnight, if I can obtain
          hearers. I have not done it from imitation, but for the best of
          reasons -- the hope of doing good, and the wish to be the means of
          gathering in the outcasts of Israel. God is my witness, I would preach
          every hour of the day, if body and mind were equal to the task. When I
          consider how souls are being damned and how few there are who mourn
          and cry over them, I am constrained to cry with Paul, |Woe is me if I
          preach not the gospel.| Oh, that the new year may be far better than
          the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am almost sorry to see this service in print, and fear it will rob
          many of their week's food from the regular sermon; but as it is done,
          I pray the Lord to own it for Jesus' sake. -- C.H.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapel being densely crowded in every part, the preacher entered
          the pulpit, and after prayer, solemnly read the verse -- which the
          congregation then sang --
        </p>
        <p>|Ye virgin souls, arise!</p>
        <p>With all the dead awake;</p>
        <p>Unto salvation wise;</p>
        <p>Oil in your vessels take:</p>
        <p>Upstarting at the MIDNIGHT CRY,</p>
        <p>Behold Your heavenly bridegroom nigh.|</p>
        <p>
          Two brethren then offered prayer for the Church and the World, that
          the new year might be clothed with glory by the spread of the
          knowledge of Jesus. -- Then followed the
        </p>
        <p>EXPOSITION</p>
        <p>Psalm 90:1-22</p>
        <p>|Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>
        <p>
          Yea Jehovah, WE, they children, can say that thou hast been our home,
          our safe dwelling-place. And oh, what joy, what peace have we found in
          his sacred bosom. No home like the breast of the Lord, to which, in
          all generations, true believers fly. Let me ask the unbelievers where
          their joy is. Where has your habitation been, ye sons of sin and
          daughters of folly?
        </p>
        <p>
          |Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
          the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
          art God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And the same God too, loving His people, passing by their sins and
          remembering not their iniquities. Oh, beloved, let this thought cheer
          you, he was, he is, he will be God. Here change cannot climb, here
          mutation must not approach. For ever and ever he is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of
          men.|
        </p>
        <p>
          How many this year have departed. Oh, where had we been had this been
          our case? Many of us can say, we should have been in bliss, and we
          should have returned unto God, but alas, many here would have entered
          the fires of hell and commenced their never-ending torture.
        </p>
        <p>
          |For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
          past, and as a watch in the night.|
        </p>
        <p>|Thou carriest them away as with a flood.|</p>
        <p>
          Who are they who are carried away as with a flood? Yourselves, my
          hearers, and myself. Though we know it not, we are always in motion.
          The impetuous torrent of time is carrying us along like a mighty
          rolling river. We cannot stand against the force which drives us
          onwards. As powerless as the straw we are; we can by no means resist
          it. Whither are we going? Where is the river carrying us to? We cannot
          stem its torrens; we cannot escape its floods. Oh! where, oh! where,
          are we going!
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the
          morning they are like grass which groweth up.
        </p>
        <p>
          |In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is
          cut down, and withereth.
        </p>
        <p>
          |For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
          troubled.|
        </p>
        <p>
          No man better understands this than the convinced sinner, when
          smarting under the rod of God. Truly our strength is then utterly
          consumed, and the troubles of our heart are enlarged.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
          light of thy countenance.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear that! |our secret sins.| Some of you bear hell's mark on your
          forehead. Some of you, like Cain, have the mark of justice on your
          very brow. Your sins are beforehand with you in judgment. Ah! they are
          there to-night, blabbing out the tale of your sad, sad history. But
          there are persons here who have |secret sins.| Ye have not been found
          out yet. The night was too dark for human eye to se you; the deed was
          to secret for mortal to behold; but it is set somewhere. Just as we
          set a stone in a golden ring, so has God set your |secret sins in the
          light of his countenance.| Your sins are this night before the eyes of
          the infinite Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          |For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as
          a tale that is told.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vulgate translation has: |Our years pass away like those of a
          spider.| It implies that our life is as frail as the thread of a
          spider's web. Constituted most curiously the spider's web is; but what
          more fragile? In what is there more wisdom than in the complicated
          frame of a human body; and what more easily destroyed? Glass is
          granite compared with flesh; and vapours are rocks compared with life.
        </p>
        <p>|The days of our years are threescore years and ten;|</p>
        <p>
          Mark, the Psalmist says, |the days of our years.| How seldom we think
          of that! Our years we think of, but not |the days of our years.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |And if [it is a great |if| indeed, for how many die before they
          attain to it!] by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is
          their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
          away.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Where do we fly to? Is it upwards that we wing our way, on more than
          eagles' wings, to realms of joy unknown? Or is it downward that we
          sink with all our sins round our necks like millstones? Oh! shall we
          go down, down, till in hell we lift up our eyes, being in torments?
        </p>
        <p>
          |Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so
          is thy wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          |So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
          wisdom.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is heavenly arithmetic; an application of numeration seldom
          thought of even by the wise. May we, during the next year, so measure
          out our time, that we may apply our hearts to Jesus, who is the true
          wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>Amen! Lord, may that be granted!</p>
        <p>Now we will sing a verse of that solemn hymn --</p>
        <p>|When thou my righteous judge shall come,|</p>
        <p>
          and then the Pastor will make an evening's prayer for you before he
          comes to speak with your souls on God's behalf.
        </p>
        <p>HYMN</p>
        <p>|Let me among thy saints be found</p>
        <p>Whene'er the archangel's trump shall sound,</p>
        <p>To see thy smiling face:</p>
        <p>Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heav'n's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace.|</p>
        <p>PRAYER</p>
        <p>
          O God, save my people! Save my people! A solemn charge hast thou given
          to thy servant. Ah! Lord, it is all too solemn for such a child. Help
          him; help him by thine own grace, to discharge it as he ought. O Lord,
          let thy servant confess that he feels that his prayers are not as
          earnest as they should be for his people's souls; that he does not
          preach so frequently as he ought, with that fire, that energy, that
          true love to men's souls. But O Lord, damn not the hearers for the
          preacher's sin. Oh, destroy not the flock for the shepherd's iniquity.
          Have mercy on them, good Lord, have mercy on them, O Lord, have mercy
          on them! There are some, Father, that will not have mercy on
          themselves. How have we preached to them, and laboured for them! O God
          thou knowest that I lie not. How have I striven for them, that they
          might be saved! But the heart is too hard for man to melt, and the
          soul made of iron too hard for flesh and blood to render soft. O God,
          the God of Israel, thou canst save. There is the pastor's hope; there
          is the minister's trust. He cannot but thou canst, Lord; they will not
          come, but thou canst make them willing in the day of thy power. They
          will not come unto thee that they may have life; but thou canst draw
          them, and then they shall run after thee. They cannot come; but thou
          canst give them power; for though no man cometh except the Father draw
          him, yet if he draw him then he can come, O Lord, for another year has
          thy servant preached -- thou knowest how. It is not for him to plead
          his cause with thee -- that is in another's hands, and has been there,
          thank God, years ago. But now, O Lord, we beseech thee, bless our
          people. Let this our church, thy church, be still knit together in
          unity; and this night may they commence a fresh era of prayer. They
          are a praying people, blessed by thy name, and they pray for their
          minister with all their hearts. O Lord, help them to pray more
          earnestly. May we wrestle in prayer more than ever, and besiege thy
          throne until thou makest Jerusalem a praise not only here, but
          everywhere. But, Father, it is not the church we weep for; it is not
          the church we groan for; it is the world. O Faithful Promisor, hast
          thou not promised to thy Son that he should not die in vain? Give him
          souls we beseech thee, that he may be abundantly satisfied. Hast thou
          not promised thy church that she shall be increased? Oh, increase her,
          increase her. And hast thou not promised that thy ministers shall not
          labour in vain? For thou hast said that |as the rain cometh down and
          the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the
          earth, even so shall thy word be: it shall not return unto thee void.|
          Let not the word return void tonight; but now may thy servant in the
          most earnest manner, with the most fervent heart, burning with love to
          his Saviour, and with love to souls, preach once more the glorious
          gospel of the blessed God. Come, Holy Spirit! We can do nothing
          without thee. We solemnly invoke thee, great Spirit of God! thou who
          didst rest on Abraham, on Isaac, and on Jacob; thou, who in the night
          visions speaketh unto men. Spirit of the Prophets, Spirit of the
          Apostles, Spirit of the Church, be thou our Spirit this night, that
          the earth may tremble, that souls may be made to hear thy Word, and
          that all flesh may rejoice together to praise thy name. Unto Father,
          Son, and Holy Ghost, the dread Supreme, be everlasting praise. Amen.

        <p>SERMON</p>
        <p>
          |Arise, cry out in the night; in the beginning of the watches pour out
          thine heart like water before the face of the Lord| -- Lamentations
          2:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was originally spoken to Zion, when in her sad and desolate
          condition, Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, had wept his eyes dry for
          the slain of the daughter of his people; and when he had done all he
          could himself to pour out tears for poor Jerusalem, he then begged
          Jerusalem to weep for herself. Methinks I might become a Jeremy
          to-night, and weep as he, for surely the church at large is in almost
          as evil a condition. O Zion, how hast thou been veiled in a cloud, and
          how is thy honor trodden in the dust! Arise, ye sons of Zion, and weep
          for your mother, yea weep bitterly, for she hath given herself to
          other lovers, and forsaken the Lord that bought her. I bear witness
          this night, in the midst of this solemn assembly, that the church at
          large is wickedly departing from the living God; she is leaving the
          truth which was once her glory, and she is mixing herself among the
          nations. Ah! beloved, it were well if Zion now could sometimes weep;
          it were well if there were more who would lay to heart the wound of
          the daughter of his people. How hath the city become a harlot! how
          hath the much fine gold become dim! and how hath the glory departed!
          Zion is under a cloud. Her ministers preach not with the energy and
          fire that anciently dwelt in the lips of God's servants, neither is
          pure and undefiled doctrine proclaimed in her streets. Where are her
          evangelists who with earnest hearts traversed the land with the gospel
          on their lips. Where are her apostolic preachers who everywhere
          declared the good tidings of salvation. Alas for the idle shepherds!
          Alas for the slumbering ministers! Weep sore, O Zion! weep thee sore,
          until another reformation comes to sweep thy floor. Weep thee, Zion:
          weep until he shall come whose fan is in his hand, who shall
          thoroughly purge his floor; for the time is coming when judgment must
          begin at the house of God. Oh, that now the princes of Israel had
          wisdom, that they might seek the Lord; but alas, our leaders have
          given themselves to false doctrine; neither do they love the thing
          which is right. Therefore I charge thee, |Arise,| O Zion, |cry out in
          the night, in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like
          water before the face of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We leave Zion, however, to speak to those who need exhortation more
          than Zion does; to speak to those who are Zion's enemies, or followers
          of Zion, and yet not belonging to her ranks. To them we shall have a
          word or two to say to-night.
        </p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>
          First, from our text we gather -- that it is never too soon to pray.
          |Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out
          thine heart like water before the face of the Lord.| You are lying on
          your bed; the gracious Spirit whispers -- |Arise, and pray to God.|
          Well, there is no reason why you should delay till the morning light:
          |in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water
          before the face of the Lord.| We are told there that it is never too
          soon to pray. How many young persons imagine that religion is a thing
          for age, or at least for maturity; but they conceive that whilest they
          are in the bloom of their youth, they need not attend to its
          admonitions. How many have we found who count religion to be a crutch
          for old age, who reckon it an ornament to their grey hairs, forgetting
          that to the young man religion is like a chain of gold around his
          neck, and like an ornament set with precious jewels, that shall array
          him with honour. How many there be who think it is yet too soon for
          them to bear for a single moment the cross of Jesus. They do not want
          to have their young shoulders galled with an early burden; they do not
          think it is true that |it is good for a man to bean the yoke in his
          youth;| and they forget that |yoke is easy,| and that |burden is
          light.| Therefore, hour after hour, and day after day, the malicious
          fiend whispers in their ear -- |It is too soon, it is too soon!
          Postpone, postpone, postpone! Procrastinate!| Need we tell you once
          more that oft-repeated axiom, |Procrastination is the thief of time?|
          Need we remind you that |delays are dangerous?| Need we tell you that
          those are the workings of Satan? For the Holy Ghost, when he strives
          with man, says, |To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
          heart.| It is never, beloved, too soon to pray. Art thou a child
          to-night? Thy God heareth children. He called Samuel when he was but a
          child. |Samuel, Samuel;| and he said, |Here am I.| We have had our
          Josiahs; we have heard of our Timothys; we have seen those in early
          youth who have been brought to the Saviour. Oh! remember it is not too
          soon to seek the Saviour, ere you arrive at manhood. If God in his
          mercy calls you to him, I beseech you think not for a moment that he
          will not hear you. I trust I know his name; yea, more than that, I
          know I do. |I know whom I have believed.| But he did not call me too
          early. Though but a child, I descended into the pool of baptism, there
          to be buried with my Saviour. Oh! I wish I could say that all those
          fourteen or fifteen year of my life had not been thrown away. Blessed
          be his name, he never calls us too soon. If he rises early in the
          morning, and sends some into his vineyard to labour, he does not send
          them before they should go -- before there is work for them to do.
          Young man, it is not too soon. |Arise, cry out in the night: in the
          beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the
          face of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>2.</p>
        <p>
          Again; it is not too late to cry to the Lord; for if the sun be set,
          and the watches of the night have commenced their round, the mercy
          seat is open. No shop is open so late as the House of Mercy. The devil
          has two tricks with men. Sometimes he puts their clock a little
          backward, and he says, |Stop, there is time enough yet;| and when that
          does not answer, he turns the hands on, and he cries out, |Too late!
          too late| Old man, has the devil said |It is too late?| Convinced
          sinner, has Satan said |It is too late?| Troubled, distressed one, has
          the thought risen in thy soul -- a bitter and a dark one -- |It is too
          late?| It is not. Within another fifteen minutes another year shall
          have come; but if the Spirit of God calls you this year, he will not
          call you too late in the year. If to the last second you should live,
          if God the Holy Ghost calls you then, he will not have called you too
          late. Ah! ye desponding ones, who think it is all too late -- it is
          not.
        </p>
        <p>While the lamp holds out to burn,</p>
        <p>The vilest sinner that returns</p>
        <p>
          shall find mercy and peace. There have been some older than you can
          be; some as sinful and vile, and heinously wicked, who have provoked
          God as much, who have sinned against him as frequently, and yet they
          have found pardon. If he call thee, sinner, if he call thee to-night,
          12 o'clock is not too late, as 1 o'clock is not too early. If he call
          thee, whether it be at midnight, or cock-crowing, or noon-day, we
          would say to thee, as they did to the blind man, |Arise; he calleth
          thee.| And as sure as ever he calls you, he will not send you away
          without a blessing. It is not too late to call on God. The darkness of
          night is gathering; it is coming on, and you are near to death. Arise,
          sleeper, arise! thou who art now taking the last nap of death. |Arise,
          cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine
          heart like water before the face of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>3.</p>
        <p>
          Next: we cannot pray too vehemently, for the text says, |Arise, cry
          out in the night.| God loves earnest prayers. He loves impetuous
          prayers -- vehement prayers. Let a man preach if he dare coldly and
          slowly, but never let him pray so. God loveth crying-out prayers.
          There is a poor fellow who says -- |I don't know how to pray.| |Why,
          sir?| He says, |I could not put six or seven words together in English
          grammar. Tush upon English grammar! God does not care for that, so
          long as you pour out your heart. That is enough. Cry out before him.
          |Ah!| says one, |I have been supplicating to God. I think I have asked
          for mercy.| But perhaps you have not cried out. Cry out before God. I
          have often heard men say they have prayed and have not been heard. But
          I have known the reason. They have asked amiss if they have asked; and
          those who cry with weak voices, who do not cry aloud, must not expect
          to get a blessing. When you go to mercy's gate, let me give you a
          little advice. Do not go and give a gentle tap, like a lady; do not
          give a single knock, like a beggar; but take the knocker and rap hard,
          till the very door seems to shake. Rap with all your might! and
          recollect that God loveth those who knock hard at mercy's gate.
          |Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.| I picture the scene at
          midnight, which our Saviour mentioned in the parable, and it will suit
          the present occasion. A certain man wanted some bread; a friend of his
          on a journey had come to his house and was very faint, and needed
          bread to eat. So off he went to his next door neighbour and rapped at
          his door, but no one came. He stood beneath the window and called out
          his friend's name. His friend answered from the top of the house,
          where he had been lying asleep, |My wife and children are with me in
          bed, and I cannot rise and give the.| But the man did not care about
          that. His poor friend wanted bread; so he called out aloud -- |It is
          bread I want, and bread I must have!| I fancy I see the man lying and
          sleeping there. He says, |I shan't get up; it is very cold to-night.
          How can you expect me to rise and go down stairs to get bread for you?
          I won't; I can't; I shan't.| So he wraps himself very comfortably
          again and lays down to sleep once more. What does the man down below
          do? Oh! I hear him still. |Awake, sir! I must have it! I will have it!
          My friend is starving.| |Go home, you fellow! Don't disturb me this
          time of night.| |I must have bread! Why don't you come and let me have
          it!| says the other; but the friend vexed and angry lies down again on
          his bed. Still at the door there comes a heavier and a heavier rap,
          and the man still shouts -- |Bread, sir, bread! You will not sleep all
          night till you come down and give it me!| And verily I say unto you,
          though he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend,
          yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he
          needeth. |Arise, cry out in the night,| and God will hear you, if you
          cry out with all your souls, and pour out your hearts before him.
        </p>
        <p>4.</p>
        <p>
          And now our last remark is -- we cannot pray too simply. Just hear how
          the Psalmist has it: |pour out your hearts before him.| Not |pour out
          your fine words,| not |pour out your beautiful periods,| but |pour out
          your hearts.| |I dare not,| says one, |there is black stuff in my
          heart.| Out withit then: it is better out than in. |I cannot,| says
          another, |it would not run freely.| Pour it out, sir; pour it all out
          -- like water! Do you not notice something in this? Some men say -- |I
          cannot pray as I could wish; my crying out is a feeble one.| Well,
          when you pour out water it does not make much noise. So you can pour
          out your heart prayer uttered in a garret that nobody has heard -- but
          stop! Gabriel heard it; God himself heard it. There is many a cry down
          in a cellar, or up in a garret, or some lonely place where the cobbler
          sits mending his shoes beneath a window, whic the world does not hear,
          but the Lord hears it. Pour out your heart like water. How does water
          run out? The quickest way it can; that's all. It never stops much
          about how it runs. That is the way the Lord loves to have it. Some of
          your gentry offer prayers which are poured out drop after brop, and
          must be brought to a grand, ecclesiastical, prayer-book shape. Now,
          take your heart and pour it out like water. |What!| says one, |with
          all the oaths in it?| Yes. |With all my old sins in it?| Yes. Pour out
          your heart like water; pour it out by confessing all your sins; pour
          it out by begging the Lord to have mercy upon you for Christ's sake;
          pour it out like water. And when it is all poured out, he will come
          and fill it again with |wine on the lees, well refined.| |Arise, cry
          out in the night; in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart
          like water before the face of the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus do I speak to all who will acknowledge themselves to be sinners
          in the sight of God, but even these must have the assistance of the
          Holy Spirit to enable them to cry out, O my Lord, grant it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, dear friends, may grace be given unto you, that ye may be
          able to pour out your hearts this night! Remember, my hearers, it may
          seem a light thing for us to assemble to-night at such an hour, but
          listen for one moment to the ticking of that clock! [Here the preacher
          paused, and amid solemn silence every one heard the clock with its
          tick, tick, tick.] It is the beating of the pulse of eternity. You
          hear the ticking of that clock! -- it is the footstep of death
          pursuing you. Each time the clock ticks, death's footsteps are falling
          on the ground close behind you. You will soon enter another year. This
          year will have gone in a few seconds.1855 is almost gone; where will
          the next year be spent, my friends? One has been spent on earth; where
          will you spend the next? |In heaven!| says one, |I trust.| Another
          murmurs, |Perhaps I shall spend mine in hell!| Ah! solemn is the
          thought, but before that clock strikes 12, some here may be in hell;
          and blessed be the name of God! some of us may be in heaven! But O, do
          you know how to estimate your time, my hearers? do you know how to
          measure your days? Oh! I have not words to speak to-night. Do you know
          that every hour you are nearing the tomb? that every hour you are
          nearing judgment? that the archangel is flapping his wings every
          second of your life, and, trumpet at his mouth, is approaching you?
          that you do not live stationary lives, but always going on, on, on,
          towards the grave? Do you know where the stream of life is hastening
          some of you? To the rapids -- to the rapids of woe and destruction!
          What shall the end of those be who obey not the gospel of God? Ye will
          not have so many years to live as ye had last year! See the man who
          has but a few shillings in his pocket, how he takes them out and
          spends them one by one! Now he has but a few coppers, and there is so
          much for that tiny candle, so much for that piece of bread. He counts
          the articles out one by one; and so the money goes! You think there is
          no bottom to your pockets; you think you have a boundless store of
          time -- but you have not! As the Lord liveth, there is a young man
          here that has not more than one year to live; and yet he is spending
          all that he is worth of time, in sin, in folly, and vice. Some of you
          have not that to live; and yet how are you spending your time! O take
          care! take care! time is precious! and whenever we have little of it,
          it is more precious; yea, it is most precious. May God help you to
          escape from hell and fly to heaven! I feel like the angel, to-night,
          who put his hand upon Lot, and cried -- |Escape! look not behind thee!
          stay not in all the plain; flee to the mountain, lest thou be
          consumed!|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I appreciate the power of silence. You will please to observe
          strict and solemn silence until the striking of that clock; and let
          each one spend the time as he pleases. [It was now two minutes to
          twelve, and profound silence reigned, save where sobs and groans could
          be distinctly heard from penitent lips seeking the Saviour. The clock
          having struck, Mr Spurgeon continued:] You are now where you never
          were before; and you never will be again where you have been to-night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have had a solemn meeting, and let us have a cheerful ending of
          it. As we go away let us sing a sweet hymn to encourage our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>[A hymn was then sung]</p>
        <p>
          Now may the Lord bless you, and lift up the light of his countenance
          upon you, and give you peace! May you, during this year of grace;
          receive much grace; and may you proceed onwards towards heaven! And
          may we as a church, as members of churches, as ministers, as deacons,
          mutually strive together for the faith of Jesus, and be edified
          therein! And may the Lord save the ungodly! If the last year is clean
          gone and they are not yet pardoned and forgiven, let not another year
          roll away without their finding mercy!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord dismiss you all with his sweet blessing, for his blessed
          Son's sake, Amen. And may the love of Jesus Christ, the grace of his
          Father, and the fellowship of his blessed Spirit be yours, my beloved,
          if ye know Christ, world without end. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my friends, in the highest and best sense, I wish you all a happy
          new year.<br />
