        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2026)</p>
        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-day, June 17, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          |He trusted in God; let him deliver him now; if he will have him: for
          he said, I am the Son of God.| -- Matthew 27:43.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE WORDS ARE a fulfilment of the prophecy contained in the
          twenty-second Psalm. Read from the seventh verse -- |All they that see
          me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head,
          saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him
          deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.| Thus to the letter doth our
          Lord answer to the ancient prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very painful to the heart to picture our blessed Master in his
          death-agonies, surrounded by a ribald multitude, who watched him and
          mocked him, made sport of his prayer and insulted his faith. Nothing
          was sacred to them: they invaded the Holy of holies of his confidence
          in God, and taunted him concerning that faith in Jehovah which they
          were compelled to admit. See, dear friends, what an evil thing is sin,
          since the Sin-bearer suffers so bitterly to make atonement for it!
          See, also, the shame of sin, since even the Prince of Glory, when
          bearing the consequences of it, is covered with contempt! Behold,
          also, how he loved us! For our sake he |endured the cross, despising
          the shame.| He loved us so much that even scorn of the most cruel sort
          he deigned to bear, that he might take away our shame and enable us to
          look up unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, the treatment of our Lord Jesus Christ by men is the clearest
          proof of total depravity which can possibly be required or discovered.
          Those must be stony hearts indeed which can laugh at a dying Saviour,
          and mock even at his faith in God! Compassion would seem to have
          deserted humanity, while malice sat supreme on the throne. Painful as
          the picture is, it will do you good to paint it. You will need neither
          canvas, nor brush, nor palette, nor colours. Let your thoughts draw
          the outline, and your love fill in the detail; I shall not complain if
          imagination heightens the colouring. The Son of God, whom angels adore
          with veiled faces, is pointed at with scornful fingers by men who
          thrust out the tongue and mockingly exclaim, |He trusted on the Lord
          that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in
          him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          While thus we see our Lord in his sorrow and his shame as our
          substitute, we must not forget that he also is there as our
          representative. That which appears in many a psalm to relate to David
          is found in the Gospels to refer to Jesus, our Lord. Often and often
          the student of the Psalm will say to himself, |Of whom speaketh the
          prophet this?| He will have to disentangle the threads sometimes, and
          mark off that which belongs to David and that which relates to the Son
          of God; and frequently he will not be able to disentangle the threads
          at all, because they are one, and may relate both to David, and to
          David's Lord. This is meant to show us that the life of Christ is an
          epitome of the life of his people. He not only suffers for us as our
          substitute, but he suffers before us as our pattern. In him we see
          what we have in our measure to endure. |As he is, so are we also in
          this world.| We also must be crucified to the world, and we may look
          for somewhat of those tests of faith and taunts of derision which go
          with such a crucifixion. |Marvel not if the world hate you.| You, too,
          must suffer without the gate. Not for the world's redemption, but for
          the accomplishment of divine purposes in you, and through you to the
          sons of men, you must be made to know the cross and its shame. Christ
          is the mirror of the church. What the head endured every member of the
          body will also have to endure in its measure. Let us read the text in
          this light, and come to it saying to ourselves, |Here we see what
          Jesus suffered in our stead, and we learn hereby to love him with all
          our souls. Here, too, we see, as in a prophecy, how great things we
          are to suffer for his sake at the hands of men.| May the Holy Spirit
          help us in our meditation, so that at the close of it we may more
          ardently love our Lord, who suffered for us, and may the more
          carefully arm ourselves with the same mind which enabled him to endure
          such contradiction of sinners against himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming at once to the text, first, observe the acknowledgment with
          which the text begins: |He trusted in God.| The enemies of Christ
          admitted his faith in God. Secondly, consider the test which is the
          essence of the taunt: |Let him deliver him, if he will have him.| When
          we have taken those two things into our minds, then let us for a while
          consider the answer to that test and taunt: God does assuredly deliver
          his people: those who trust in him have no reason to be ashamed of
          their faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, my beloved brethren, you who know the Lord by faith
          and live by trusting in him, let me invite you to OBSERVE THE
          ACKNOWLEDGMENT which these mockers made of our Lord's faith: |He
          trusted in God.| Yet the Saviour did not wear any peculiar garb or
          token by which he let men know that he trusted in God. He was not a
          recluse, neither did he join some little knot of separatists, who
          boasted their peculiar trust in Jehovah. Although our Saviour was
          separate from sinners, yet he was eminently a man among men, and he
          went in and out among the multitude as one of themselves. His one
          peculiarity was that |he trusted in God.| He was so perfectly a man
          that, although he was undoubtedly a Jew, there were no Jewish
          peculiarities about him. Any nation might claim him; but no nation
          could monopolize him. The characteristics of our humanity are so
          palpably about him that he belongs to all mankind. I admire the Welch
          sister who was of opinion that the Lord Jesus must be Welch. When they
          asked her how she proved it, she said that he always spoke to her
          heart in Welch. Doubtless it was so, and I can, with equal warmth,
          declare that he always speaks to me in English. Brethren from Germany,
          France, Sweden, Italy -- you all claim that he speaks to you in your
          own tongue. This was the one thing which distinguished him among men
          -- |he trusted in God,| and he lived such a life as naturally grows
          out of faith in the Eternal Lord. This peculiarity had been visible
          even to that ungodly multitude who least of all cared to perceive a
          spiritual point of character. Was ever any other upon a cross thus
          saluted by the mob who watched his execution? Had these scorners ever
          mocked anyone before for such a matter as this? I trow not. Yet faith
          had been so manifest in our Lord's daily life that the crowd cried out
          aloud, |He trusted in God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          How did they know? I suppose they could not help seeing that he made
          much of God in his teaching, in his life, and in his miracles.
          Whenever Jesus spoke it was always godly talk; and if it was not
          always distinctly about God, it was always about things that related
          to God, that came from God, that led to God, that magnified God. A man
          may be fairly judged by that which he makes most of. The ruling
          passion is a fair gauge of the heart. What a soul-ruler faith is! It
          sways the man as the rudder guides the ship. When a man once gets to
          live by faith in God, it tinctures his thoughts, it masters his
          purposes, it flavours his words, it puts a tone into his actions, and
          it comes out in everything by ways and means most natural and
          unconstrained, till men perceive that they have to do with a man who
          makes much of God. The unbelieving world says outright that there is
          no God, and the less impudent, who admit his existence, put him down
          at a very low figure, so low that it does not affect their
          calculations; but to the true Christian, God is not only much, but
          all. To our Lord Jesus, God was all in all; and when you come to
          estimate God as he did, then the most careless onlooker will soon
          begin to say of you, |He trusted in God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to observing that Jesus made much of God, men came to note
          that he was a trusting man, and not self-confident. Certain persons
          are very proud because they are self-made men. I will do them the
          credit to admit that they heartily worship their maker. Self made
          them, and they worship self. We have among us individuals who are
          self-confident, and almost all-sufficient; they sneer at those who do
          not succeed, for they can succeed anywhere at anything. The world to
          them is a football which they can kick where they like. If they do not
          rise to the very highest eminence it is simply out of pity to the rest
          of us, who ought to have a chance. A vat of sufficiency ferments
          within their ribs! There was nothing of that sort of thing in our
          Lord. Those who watched him did not say that he had great
          self-reliance and a noble spirit of self-confidence. No, no! They
          said, |He trusted in God.| Indeed it was so. The words that he spake
          he spake not of himself, and the great deeds that he did he never
          boasted of, but said |the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
          works.| He was a truster in God, not a boaster in self. Brethren and
          sisters, I desire that you and I may be just of that order.
          Selfconfidence is the death of confidence in God; reliance upon
          talent, tact, experience, and things of that kind, kills faith. Oh
          that we may know what faith means, and so look out of ourselves and
          quit the evil confidence which looks within!
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, we may wisely remember that, while our Lord Jesus
          was not self-reliant, he trusted, and was by no means despondent: he
          was never discouraged. He neither questioned his commission, nor
          despaired of fulfilling it. He never said, |I must give it up: I can
          never succeed.| No; |He trusted in God.| And this is a grand point in
          the working of faith, that while it keeps us from self-conceit, it
          equally preserves us from enfeebling fear. When our blessed Lord set
          his face like a flint; when, being baffled, he returned to the
          conflict; when, being betrayed, he still persevered in his love, then
          men could not help seeing that he trusted in God. His faith was not
          mere repetition of a creed, or profession of belief, but it was
          childlike reliance upon the Most High. May ours be of the same order!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that the Lord Jesus trusted in God openly since even
          yonder gibing crowd proclaimed it. Some good people try to exercise
          faith on the sly: they practise it in snug corners, and in lonely
          hours, but they are afraid to say much before others, for fear their
          faith should not see the promise fulfilled. They dare not say, with
          David, |My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall
          hear thereof, and be glad.| This secrecy robs God of his honour.
          Brethren, we do not glorify our God as he ought to be glorified. Let
          us trust in him, and own it. Wherefore should we be ashamed? Let us
          throw down the gauge of battle to earth and hell. God, the true and
          faithful, deserves to be trusted without limit. Trust your all with
          him, and be not ashamed of having done so. Our Saviour was not ashamed
          of trusting in his God. On the cross he cried, |Thou didst make me
          hope when I was upon my mother's breast.| Jesus lived by faith. We are
          sure that he did, for in the Epistle to the Hebrews he is quoted as
          saying, |I will put my trust in him.| If so glorious a personage as
          the only begotten Son of God lived here by faith in God, how are you
          and I to live except by trust in God? If we live unto God, this is the
          absolute necessity of our spiritual life |the just shall live by
          faith.| Shall we be ashamed of that which brings life to us? The cruel
          ones who saw Jesus die did not say, |He now and then trusted in God|;
          nor |he trusted in the Lord years ago|; but they admitted that faith
          in God was the constant tenor of his life: they could not deny it.
          Even though, with malicious cruelty, they turned it into a taunt, yet
          they did not cast a question upon the fact that |he trusted in God|
          Oh, I want you so to live that those who dislike you most may,
          nevertheless, know that you do trust in God! When you come to die, may
          your dear children say of you, |Our dear mother did trust in the
          Lord|! May that boy, who has gone furthest away from Christ, and
          grieved your heart the most, nevertheless say in his heart, |There may
          be hypocrites in the world, but my dear father does truly trust in
          God|! Oh, that our faith may be known unmistakably! We do not wish it
          to be advertised to our own honour. That be far from our minds. But
          yet we would have it known that others may be encouraged, and that God
          may be glorified. If nobody else trusts in God, let us do so; and thus
          may we uplift a testimony to the honour of his faithfulness. When we
          die, may this be our epitaph -- |He trusted in God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          David, in the twenty-second Psalm, represents the enemies as saying of
          our Lord -- |He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him.| This
          practical faith is sure to be known wherever it is in operation,
          because it is exceedingly rare. Multitudes of people have a kind of
          faith it God, but it does not come to the practical point of trusting
          that God will deliver them. I see upon the newspaper placards,
          |Startling New! People in the Planets!| Not a very practical
          discovery. For many a day there has been a tendency to refer God's
          promises and our faith to the planets, or somewhere beyond this
          present every-day life. We say to ourselves, |Oh yes, God delivers his
          people.| We mean that he did so in the days of Moses, and possibly he
          may be doing so now in some obscure island of the sea. Ah me! The
          glory of faith lies it its being fit for every-day wear. Can it be
          said of you, |He trusted in God, that he would deliver him|? Have you
          faith of the kind which will make you lean upon the Lord in poverty,
          in sickness, in bereavement, in persecution, in slander, in contempt?
          Have you a trust in God to bear you up in holy living at all costs,
          and in active service even beyond your strength? Can you trust in God
          definitely about this and that? Can you trust about food, and raiment,
          and home? Can you trust God even about your shoes, that they shall be
          iron and brass, and about the hairs of your head that they are all
          numbered? What we need is less theory and more actual trust it God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faith of the text was personal: |that he would deliver him.|
          Blessed is that faith which can reach its arm of compassion around the
          world, but that faith must begin at home. Of what use were the longest
          arm if it were not fixed to the man himself at the shoulder? If you
          have no faith about yourself, what faith can you have about others?
          |He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him.| Come, beloved,
          have you such a faith in the living God? Do you trust in God through
          Christ Jesus that he will save you? Yes, you poor, unworthy one, the
          Lord will deliver you if you trust him. Yes, poor woman, or unknown
          man, the Lord can help you in your present trouble, and in every
          other, and he will do so if you trust him to that end. May the Holy
          Spirit lead you to first trust the Lord Jesus for the pardon of sin,
          and then to trust in God for all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us pause a minute. Let a man trust in God; not in fiction but in
          fact, and he will find that he has solid rock under his feet. Let him
          trust about his own daily needs and trials, and rest assured that the
          Lord will actually appear for him, and he will not be disappointed.
          Such a trust in God is a very reasonable thing; its absence is most
          unreasonable. If there be a God, he knows all about my case. If he
          made my ear he can hear me; if he made my eye he can see me; and
          therefore he perceives my condition. If he be my Father, as he says he
          is, he will certainly care for me, and will help me in my hour of need
          if he can. We are sure that he can, for he is omnipotent. Is there
          anything unreasonable, then, in trusting in God that he will deliver
          us? I venture to say that if all the forces in the universe were put
          together, and all the kindly intents of all who are our friends were
          put together, and we were then to rely upon those united forces and
          intents, we should not have a thousandth part so much justification
          for our confidence as when we depend upon God, whose intents and
          forces are infinitely greater than those of all the world beside. |It
          is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is
          better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.| If you
          view things in the white light of pure reason, it is infinitely more
          reasonable to trust in the living God than in all his creatures put
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, dear friends, it is extremely comfortable to trust in God.
          I find it so, and therefore speak. To roll your burden upon the Lord,
          since he will sustain you, is a blessed way of being quit of care. We
          know him to be faithful, and as powerful as he is faithful; and our
          dependence upon him is the solid foundation of a profound peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is comfortable, it is also uplifting. If you trust in men,
          the best of men, you are likely to be lowered by your trust. We are
          apt to cringe before these who patronize us. If your prosperity
          depends upon a person's smile, you are tempted to pay homage even when
          it is undeserved. The old saying mentions a certain person as |knowing
          on which side his bread is buttered.| Thousands are practically
          degraded by their trusting in men. But when our reliance is upon the
          living God we are raised by it, and elevated both morally and
          spiritually. You may bow in deepest reverence before God, and yet
          there will be no fawning. You may lie in the dust before the Majesty
          of heaven, and yet not be dishonoured by your humility; in fact, it is
          our greatness to be nothing in the presence of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          This confidence in God makes men strong. I should advise the enemy not
          to oppose the man who trusts in God. In the long run he will be
          beaten, as Haman found it with Mordecai. He had been warned of this by
          Zeresh, his wife, and his wise men, who said, | If Mordecai be of the
          seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not
          prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.| Contend not
          with a man who has God at his back. Years ago the Mentonese desired to
          break away from the dominion of the Prince of Monaco. They therefore
          drove out his agent. The prince came with his army, not a very great
          one, it is true, but still formidable to the Mentonese. I know not
          what the high and mighty princeling was not going to do; but the news
          came that the King of Sardinia was coming up in the rear to help the
          Mentonese and therefore his lordship of Monaco very prudently retired
          to his own rock. When a believer stands out against evil he may be
          sure that the Lord of hosts will not be far away. The enemy shall hear
          the dash of his horse-hoof and the blast of his trumpet, and shall
          flee before him. Wherefore be of good courage, and compel the world to
          say of you, |He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, I want you to follow me briefly in considering THE Test
          WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF THE TAUNT which was hurled by the mockers
          against our Lord -- |Let him deliver him now, if he will have him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a test will come to all believers. It may come as a taunt from
          enemies; it will certainly come as a trial of your faith. The
          arch-enemy will assuredly hiss out, |Let him deliver him, seeing he
          delighted in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This taunt has about it the appearance of being very logical, and
          indeed in a measure so it is. If God has promised to deliver us, and
          we have openly professed to believe the promise, it is only natural
          that others should say, |Let us see whether he does deliver him. This
          man believes that the Lord will help him; and he must help him, or
          else the man's faith is a delusion.| This is the sort of test to which
          we ourselves would have put others before our conversion, and we
          cannot object to be proved in the same manner ourselves. Perhaps we
          incline to run away from the ordeal, but this very shrinking should be
          a solemn call to us to question the genuineness of that faith which we
          are afraid to test. |He trusted on the Lord,| says the enemy, |that he
          would deliver him: let him deliver him|; and surely, however malicious
          the design, there is no escaping from the logic of the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is peculiarly painful to have this stern inference driven home to
          you in the hour of sorrow. Because one cannot deny the fairness of the
          appeal, it is all the more trying. In the time of depression of spirit
          it is hard to have one's faith questioned, or the ground on which it
          stands made a matter of dispute. Either to be mistaken in one's
          belief, or to have no real faith, or to find the ground of one's faith
          fail is an exceedingly grievous thing. Yet as our Lord was not spared
          this painful ordeal, we must not expect to be kept clear of it, and
          Satan knows well how to work these questions, till the poison of them
          sets the blood on fire. |He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver
          him; let him deliver him;| he hurls this fiery dart into the soul,
          till the man is sorely wounded, and can scarcely hold his ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The taunt is specially pointed and personal. It is put thus: |He
          trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him|;
          |Do not come to us with your fiddle-faddle about God's helping all his
          chosen. Here is a man who is one of his people, will he help him? Do
          not talk to us big things about Jehovah at the Red Sea, or in the
          Desert of Sinai, or God helping his people in ages past. Here is a
          living man before us who trusted in God that he would deliver him: let
          him deliver him now.| You know how Satan will pick out one of the most
          afflicted, and pointing his fingers at him will cry, |Let him deliver
          HIM.| Brethren, the test is fair. God will be true to every believer.
          If any one child of God could be lost, it would be quite enough to
          enable the devil to spoil all the glory of God for ever. If one
          promise of God to one of his people should fail, that one failure
          would suffice to mar the veracity of the Lord to all eternity; they
          would publish it in the |Diabolical Gazette,| and in every street of
          Tophet they would howl it out, |God has failed. God has broken his
          promise. God has ceased to be faithful to his people.| It would then
          be a horrible reproach -- |He trusted in God to deliver him, but he
          did not deliver him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Much emphasis lies in its being in the present tense: |He trusted in
          God that he would deliver him: let him deliver him now.| I see Thee, O
          Lord Jesus, thou art now in the wilderness, where the fiend is saying,
          |If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.|
          No. Thou art nailed to the tree; thine enemies have hemmed thee in.
          The legionaries of Rome are at the foot of the cross, the scribes and
          Pharisees and raging Jews compass thee about. There is no escape from
          death for thee! Hence their cry -- |Let him deliver him now.| Ah,
          brothers and sisters! this is how Satan assails us, using our present
          and pressing tribulations as the barbs of his arrows. Yet here also
          there is reason and logic in the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          If God does not deliver his servants at one time as well as another he
          has not kept his promise. For a man of truth is always true, and a
          promise once given always stands. A promise cannot be broken now and
          then, and yet the honour of the person giving it be maintained by his
          keeping it at other times. The word of a true man stands always good:
          it is good now. This is logic, bitter logic, cold steel logic, logic
          which seems to cut right down your backbone and cleave your chine. |He
          trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him
          now.| Yet this hard logic can be turned to comfort. I told you a story
          the other day of the brother in Guy's Hospital to whom the doctors
          said that he must undergo an operation which was extremely dangerous.
          They gave him a week to consider whether he would submit to it. He was
          troubled for his young wife and children, and for his work for the
          Lord. A friend left a bunch of flowers for him, with this verse as its
          motto, |He trusted in God; let him deliver him now.| |Yes,| he
          thought, |now|. In prayer he cast himself upon the Lord, and felt in
          his heart, |Come on, doctors, I am ready for you.| When the next
          morning came, he refused to take chloroform, for he desired to go to
          heaven in his senses. He bore the operation manfully, and he is yet
          alive. |He trusted in the Lord that he would deliver him| then and
          there, and the Lord did so. In this lies the brunt of the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christian man may be beaten in business, he may fail to meet all
          demands, and then Satan yells, |Let him deliver him now.| The poor man
          has been out of work for two or three months, tramping the streets of
          London until he has worn out his boots; he has been brought to his
          last penny. I think I hear the laugh of the Prince of Darkness as he
          cries, |Let him deliver him now.| Or else the believer is very ill in
          body, and low in spirit, and then Satan howls, |Let him deliver him
          now.| Some of us have been in very trying positions. We were moved
          with indignation because of deadly error, and we spoke plainly, but
          men refused to hear. Those we relied upon deserted us; good men sought
          their own ease and would not march with us, and we had to bear
          testimony for despised truth alone, until we were ourselves despised.
          Then the adversary shouted, |Let him deliver him now.| Be it so! We do
          not refuse the test. Our God whom we serve will deliver us. We will
          not bow down to modern thought nor worship the image which human
          wisdom has set up. Our God is God both of hills and of valleys. He
          will not fail his servants, albeit that for a while he forbears that
          he may try their faith. We dare accept the test, and say, |Let him
          deliver us now.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved friends, we need not be afraid of this taunt if it is brought
          by adversaries; for, after all, no test will come to us apart from any
          malice, for it is inevitable. All the faith you have will be tried. I
          can see you heaping it up. How rich you are! What a pile of faith!
          Friend, you are almost perfect! Open the furnace door and put the heap
          in. Do you shrink? See how it shrivels! Is there anything left? Bring
          hither a magnifying glass. Is this all that is left? Yes, this is all
          that remains of the heap. You say, |I trusted in God.| Yes, but you
          had reason to cry, |Lord, help my unbelief.| Brethren, we have not a
          tithe of the faith we think we have. But whether or not, all our faith
          must be tested. God builds no ships but what he sends to sea. In
          living, in losing, in working, in weeping, in suffering, or in
          striving, God will find a fitting crucible for every single grain of
          the precious faith which he has given us. Then he will come to us and
          say -- You trusted in God that he would deliver you, and you shall be
          delivered now. How you will open your eyes as you see the Lord's hand
          of deliverance! What a man of wonders you will be when you tell in
          your riper years to the younger people how the Lord delivered you!
          Why, there are some Christians I know of who, like the ancient
          mariner, could detain even a wedding guest with their stories of God's
          wonders on the deep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, the test will come again and again. May the gibes of adversaries
          only make us ready for the sterner ordeals of the judgment to come. O
          my dear friends, examine your religion. You have a great deal of it,
          some of you; but what of its quality? Can your religion stand the test
          of poverty, and scandal, and scorn? Can it stand the test of
          scientific sarcasm and learned contempt? Will your religion stand the
          test of long sickness of body and depression of spirit caused by
          weakness? What are you doing amid the common trials of life? What will
          you do in the swellings of Jordan? Examine well your faith, since all
          hangs there. Some of us who have lain for weeks together, peering
          through the thin veil which parts us from the unseen, have been made
          to feel that nothing will suffice us but a promise which will answer
          the taunt, |Let him deliver us now.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall finish, in the third place, dear friends, by noticing The
          Answer to the test. God does deliver those who trust in him. God's
          interposition for the faithful is not a dream, but a substantial
          reality. |Many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord
          delivereth him out of them all.| All history proves the faithfulness
          of God. Those who trust God have been in all sorts of troubles; but
          they have always been delivered. They have been bereaved. What a
          horrible bereavement was that which fell to the lot of Aaron, when his
          two sons were struck dead for their profanity in the presence of God!
          |And Aaron held his peace|! What grace was there! Thus will the Lord
          sustain you also should he take away the desire of your eyes with a
          stroke. Grave after grave has the good man visited till it seemed that
          his whole race was buried, and yet his heart has not been broken; but
          he has bowed his soul before the will of the ever-blessed One. Thus
          has the Lord delivered his afflicted one by sustaining him. In other
          ways the bush has burned, and yet has not been consumed. Remember the
          multiplied and multiform trials of Job. Yet God sustained him to the
          end so that he did not charge God foolishly, but held fast his faith
          in the Most High. If ever you are called to the afflictions of Job you
          will also be called to the sustaining grace of Job. Some of God's
          servants have been defeated in their testimony. They have borne
          faithful witness for God, but they have been rejected of men. It has
          been their lot, like Cassandra, to prophesy the truth, but not to be
          believed. Such was Jeremiah, who was born to a heritage of scorn from
          those whose benefit he sought. Yet he was delivered. He shrank not
          from being faithful. His courage could not be silenced. By integrity
          he was delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Godly men have been despised and misrepresented, and yet have been
          delivered. Remember David and his envious brethren, David and the
          malignant Saul, David when his men spake of stoning him. Yet he took
          off the giant's head; yet he came to the throne; yet the Lord built
          him a house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of God's servants have been bitterly persecuted, but God has
          delivered them. Daniel came forth from the lions' den, and the three
          holy children from the midst of the burning fiery furnace. These are
          only one or two out of millions who trusted God and he delivered them.
          Out of all manner of ill the Lord delivered them. God brought this
          crowd of witnesses through all their trials unto his throne, where
          they rest with Jesus, and share the triumph of their Master at this
          very day. O my timid brother, nothing has happened to you but what is
          common to men. Your battle is not different from the warfare of the
          rest of the saints; and as God has delivered them he will deliver you
          also, seeing you put your trust in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God's ways of deliverance are his own. He does not deliver
          according to the translation put upon |deliverance| by the ribald
          throng. He does not deliver according to the interpretation put upon
          |deliverance| by our shrinking flesh and blood. He delivers, but it is
          in his own way. Let me remark that, if God delivers you and me in the
          same way as he delivered his own Son, we can have no cause of
          complaint. If the deliverance which he vouchsafed to us is of the same
          kind as that which he vouchsafed to the Only Begotten, we may well be
          content. Well, what kind of a deliverance was that? Did the Father
          tear up the cross from the earth? Did he proceed to draw out the nails
          from the sacred hands and feet of his dear Son? Did he set him down
          upon that |green hill far away, beyond the city wall,| and place in
          his hand a sword of fire with which to smite his adversaries? Did he
          bid the earth open and swallow up all his foes? No; nothing of the
          kind. Jehovah did not interpose to spare his Son a single pang; but he
          let him die. He let him be taken as a dead man down from the cross and
          laid in a tomb. Jesus went through with his suffering to the bitter
          end. O brothers and sisters, this may be God's way of delivering us.
          We have trusted in God that he would deliver us; and his rendering of
          his promise is, that he will enable us to go through with it; we shall
          suffer to the last, and triumph in so doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet God's way of delivering those who trust in him is always the best
          way. If the Father had taken his Son down from the cross, what would
          have been the result? Redemption unaccomplished, salvation work
          undone, and Jesus returning with his life-work unfinished. This would
          not have been deliverance, but defeat. It was much better for our Lord
          Jesus to die. Now he has paid the ransom for his elect, and having
          accomplished the great purpose of atonement, he has slept a while in
          the heart of the earth, and now has ascended to his throne in the
          endless glories of heaven. It was deliverance of the fullest kind; for
          from the pangs of his death has come the joy of life to his redeemed.
          It is not God's will that every mountain should be levelled, but that
          we should be the stronger for climbing the Hill Difficulty. God will
          deliver; he must deliver, but he will do it in our cases, as in the
          case of our Lord, in the best possible manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyhow, he will deliver his chosen: the taunt of the adversary shall
          not cause our God to forget or forego his people. I know that the Lord
          will no more fail me than any other of his servants. He will not leave
          a faithful witness to his adversaries. |I know that my Avenger liveth,
          and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though
          after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
          God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
          another; though my reins be consumed within me.| Is this also your
          confidence? Then do not sit down in sorrow, and act as though you
          despaired. Quit yourselves like men. Be strong, fear not. Cast
          yourselves on the love that never changeth and never fainteth, and the
          Lord will answer all the revilings of Rabshakeh, and the blusterings
          of Sennacherib.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are times when we may use this text to our comfort. |Let him
          deliver him now,| saith the text, |if he will have him.| You, dear
          friends, who have never believed in the Lord Jesus Christ before, how
          I wish you could try him now! You feel this morning full of sin, and
          full of need. Come, then, and trust the Saviour now. See whether he
          will not save you now. Is there one day in the year in which Jesus
          cannot save a sinner? Come and see whether the 17th of June is that
          day. Try whether he will not deliver you now from the guilt, the
          penalty, the power of sin. Why not come? You have never, perhaps, been
          in the Tabernacle before, and when coming here this morning you did
          not think of finding the Saviour. Oh, that the Saviour may find you!
          Jesus Christ is a Saviour every day, all the year round. Whoever
          cometh to him shall find eternal life now. |Oh,| you say, |I am in
          such an unfit state; I am in all the deshabille of my carelessness and
          godlessness.| Come along, man, come along, just as you are. Tarry not
          for improvement or arrangement, for both of these Jesus will give you;
          come and put your trust in the great Sacrifice for sin, and he will
          deliver you -- deliver you now. Lord, save the sinner, now!
        </p>
        <p>
          Others of you are the children of God, but you are in peculiar
          trouble. Well, what are you going to do? You have always trusted in
          God before; are you going to doubt him now? |O my dear sir, you do not
          know my distress; I am the most afflicted person in the Tabernacle.|
          Be it so; but you trusted in the Lord the past twenty years, and I do
          not believe that you have seen any just cause for denying him your
          confidence now. Did you say that you have known him from your youth
          up? What! you seventy years of age? Then you are too near home to
          begin distrusting your heavenly Father. That will never do. You have
          been to sea, and have weathered many a storm in mid-ocean, and are you
          now going to be drowned in a ditch? Think not so. The Lord will
          deliver you even now. Do not let us suppose that we have come where
          boundless love and infinite wisdom cannot reach us. Do not fancy that
          you have leaped upon a ledge of rock so high as to be out of reach of
          the everlasting arm. If you had done so I would still cry -- Throw
          yourself down into the arms of God, and trust that he will not let you
          be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be that some of us are in trouble about the church and the
          faith. We have defended God's truth as well as we could, and spoken
          out against deadly error; but craft and numbers have been against us,
          and at present things seem to have gone wrong. The good are timid, and
          the evil are false. They say, |He trusted in God: let him deliver him
          now.| Sirs, he will deliver us now. We will throw our soul once more
          into this battle, and see if the Lord does not vindicate his truth. If
          we have not spoken in God's name we are content to go back to the dust
          from whence we sprang; but if we have spoken God's truth we defy the
          whole confederacy to prevail against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peradventure, I speak to some missionary, who is mourning over a time
          of great trial in a mission which is dear to his heart. Ah, dear
          friend! Christ intended that the gospel should repeat his own
          experience, and then should triumph like himself. The gospel lives by
          being killed, and conquers by defect. Cast it where you will, it
          always falls upon its feet. You need not be afraid of it under any
          trial. Just now, the wisdom of man is its worst foe, but the Lord will
          deliver it now. The gospel lives and reigns. Tell it out among the
          heathen, that the Lord reigneth from the tree, and from that tree of
          the curse he issues his supreme commands. The self-same day in which
          Jesus died, he took with him into his kingdom and his inmost paradise
          a thief who had hung at his side. He liveth and reigneth for ever and
          ever, and calleth to himself whomsoever he hath chosen. Let us drown
          the taunts of the adversary with our shouts of Hallelujah! The Lord
          shall reign for ever and ever. Hallelujah. Amen!
