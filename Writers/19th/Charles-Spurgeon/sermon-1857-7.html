        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.113)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 18, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          My sermon this morning will have seven texts, and yet I pledge myself
          that there shall be but three different words in the whole of them;
          for it so happens that the seven texts are all alike, occurring in
          seven different portions of God's holy Word. I shall require, however,
          to use the whole of them to exemplify different cases; and I must
          request those of you who have brought your Bibles with you to refer to
          the texts as I shall mention them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subject of this morning's discourse will be this -- CONFESSION OF
          SIN. We know that this is absolutely necessary to salvation. Unless
          there be a true and hearty confession of our sins to God, we have no
          promise that we shall find mercy through the blood of the Redeemer.
          |Whosoever confesseth his sins and forsaketh them shall find mercy.|
          But there is no promise in the Bible to the man who will not confess
          his sins. Yet, as upon every point of Scripture there is a liability
          of being deceived, so more especially in the matter of confession of
          sin. There be many who make a confession, and a confession before God,
          who notwithstanding, receive no blessing, because their confession has
          not in it certain marks which are required by God to prove it genuine
          and sincere, and which demonstrate it to be the work of the Holy
          Spirit. My text this morning consists of three words, |I have sinned.|
          And you will see how these words, in the lips of different men,
          indicate very different feelings. While one says, |I have sinned,| and
          receives forgiveness; another we shall meet with says, |I have
          sinned,| and goes his way to blacken himself with worse crimes than
          before, and dive into greater depths of sin than heretofore he had
          discovered.
        </p>
        <p>The Hardened Sinner.</p>
        <p>PHARAOH -- |I have sinned.| -- Exodus 9:27.</p>
        <p>
          I. The first case I shall bring before you is that of the HARDENED
          SINNER, who, when under terror, says, |I have sinned.| And you will
          find the text in the book of Exodus, the 9th chap. and 27th verse:
          |And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them,
          I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people
          are wicked.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But why this confession from the lips of the haughty tyrant? He was
          not often wont to humble himself before Jehovah. Why doth the proud
          one bow himself? You will judge of the value of his confession when
          you hear the circumstances under which it was made. |And Moses
          stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and
          hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail
          upon the land of Egypt. So that there was hail, and fire mingled with
          the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the
          land of Egypt since it became a nation.| |Now,| says Pharaoh, whilst
          the thunder is rolling through the sky, while the lightning-flashes
          are setting the very ground on fire, and while the hail is descending
          in big lumps of ice, now, says he, |I have sinned.| He is but a type
          and specimen of multitudes of the same class. How many a hardened
          rebel on shipboard, when the timbers are strained and creaking, when
          the mast is broken, and the ship is drifting before the gale, when the
          hungry waves are opening their mouths to swallow the ship up alive and
          quick as those that go into the pit -- how many a hardened sailor has
          then bowed his knee, with tears in his eyes, and cried, |I have
          sinned!| But of what avail and of what value was his confession? The
          repentance that was born in the storm died in the calm; that
          repentance of his that was begotten amidst the thunder and the
          lightning, ceased so soon as all was hushed in quiet, and the man who
          was a pious mariner when on board ship, became the most wicked and
          abominable of sailors when he placed his foot on terra firma. How
          often, too, have we seen this in a storm of thunder and lightning?
          Many a man's cheek is blanched when he hears the thunder rolling; the
          tears start to his eyes, and he cries, |O God, I have sinned!| while
          the rafters of his house are shaking, and the very ground beneath him
          reeling at the voice of God which is full of majesty. But alas, for
          such a repentance! When the sun again shines, and the black clouds are
          withdrawn, sin comes again upon the man, and he becomes worse than
          before. How many of the same sort of confessions, too, have we seen in
          times of cholera, and fever, and pestilence! Then our churches have
          been crammed with hearers, who, because so many funerals have passed
          their doors, or so many have died in the street, could not refrain
          from going up to God's house to confess their sins. And under that
          visitation, when one, two, and three have been lying dead in the
          house, or next door, how many have thought they would really turn to
          God! But, alas! when the pestilence had done its work, conviction
          ceased; and when the bell had tolled the last time for a death caused
          by cholera, then their hearts ceased to beat with penitence, and their
          tears did flow no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have I any such here this morning? I doubt not I have hardened persons
          who would scorn the very idea of religion, who would count me a cant
          and hypocrite if I should endeavour to press it home upon them, but
          who know right well that religion is true, and who feel it in their
          times of terror! If I have such here this morning, let me solemnly say
          to them, |Sirs, you have forgotten the feelings you had in your hours
          of alarm; but, remember, God has not forgotten the vows you then
          made.| Sailor, you said if God would spare you to see the land again,
          you would be his servant; you are not so, you have lied against God,
          you have made him a false promise, for you have never kept the vow
          which your lips did utter. You said, on a bed of sickness, that if he
          would spare your life you would never again sin as you did before; but
          here you are, and this week's sins shall speak for themselves. You are
          no better than you were before your sickness. Couldst thou lie to thy
          fellow-man, and yet go unreproved? And thinkest thou that thou wilt
          lie against God, and yet go unpunished? No; the vow, however rashly
          made, is registered in heaven; and though it be a vow which man cannot
          perform, yet, as it is a vow which he has made himself, and made
          voluntarily too, he shall be punished for the non-keeping it; and God
          shall execute vengeance upon him at last, because he said be would
          turn from his ways, and then when the blow was removed he did it not.
          A great outcry has been raised of late against tickets-of-leave; I
          have no doubt there are some men here, who before high heaven stand in
          the same position as the ticket-of-leave men stand to our government.
          They were about to die, as they thought; they promised good behaviour
          if they might be spared, and they are here to-day on ticket-of-leave
          in this world: and how have they fulfilled their promise? Justice
          might raise the same outcry against them as they do against the
          burglars so constantly let loose upon us. The avenging angel might
          say, |O God, these men said, if they were spared they would be so much
          better; if anything they are worse. How have they violated their
          promise, and how have they brought down divine wrath upon their
          heads!| This is the first style of penitence; and it is a style I hope
          none of you will imitate, for it is utterly worthless. It is of no use
          for you to say, |I have sinned,| merely under the influence of terror,
          and then to forget it afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>The Double-minded Man.</p>
        <p>BALAAM -- |I have sinned.| -- Numbers 22:34.</p>
        <p>
          II. Now for a second text. I beg to introduce to you another character
          -- the double-minded man, who says, |I have sinned,| and feels that he
          has, and feels it deeply too, but who is so worldly-minded that he
          |loves the wages of unrighteousness.| The character I have chosen to
          illustrate this, is that of Balaam. Turn to the book of Numbers, the
          22nd chap. and the 34th verse: |And Balaam said unto the angel of the
          Lord, I have sinned.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |I have sinned,| said Balaam; but yet he went on with his sin
          afterwards. One of the strangest characters of the whole world is
          Balaam. I have often marvelled at that man; he seems really in another
          sense to have come up to the lines of Ralph Erskine --
        </p>
        <p>|To good and evil equal bent,</p>
        <p>And both a devil and a saint.|</p>
        <p>
          For he did seem to be so. At times no man could speak more eloquently
          and more truthfully, and at other times he exhibited the most mean and
          sordid covetousness that could disgrace human nature. Think you see
          Balaam; he stands upon the brow of the hill, and there lie the
          multitudes of Israel at his feet; he is bidden to curse them, and he
          cries, |How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed?| And God opening
          his eyes, he begins to tell even about the coming of Christ, and he
          says, |I shall see him, but not now. I shall behold him, but not
          nigh.| And then he winds up his oration by saying -- |Let me die the
          death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!| And ye will
          say of that man, he is a hopeful character. Wait till he has come off
          the brow of the hill, and ye will hear him give the most diabolical
          advice to the king of Moab which it was even possible for Satan
          himself to suggest. Said he to the king, | You cannot overthrow these
          people in battle, for God is with them; try and entice them from their
          God.| And ye know how with wanton lusts they of Moab tried to entice
          the children of Israel from allegiance to Jehovah; so that this man
          seemed to have the voice of an angel at one time, and yet the very
          soul of a devil in his bowels. He was a terrible character; be was a
          man of two things, a man who went all the way with two things to a
          very great extent. I know the Scripture says, |No man can serve two
          masters.| Now this is often misunderstood. Some read it, |No man can
          serve two masters.| Yes he can; he can serve three or four. The way to
          read it is this: |No man can serve two masters,| They cannot both be
          masters. He can serve two, but they cannot both be his master. A man
          can serve two who are not his masters, or twenty either; he may live
          for twenty different purposes, but he cannot live for more than one
          master purpose -- there can only be one master purpose in his soul.
          But Balaam laboured to serve two; it was like the people of whom it
          was said, |They feared the Lord, and served other gods.| Or like
          Rufus, who was a loaf of the same leaven; for you know our old king
          Rufus painted God on one side of his shield, and the devil on the
          other, and had underneath, the motto: |Ready for both; catch who can.|
          There are many such, who are ready for both. They meet a minister, and
          how pious and holy they are; on the Sabbath they are the most
          respectable and upright people in the world, as you would think;
          indeed they effect a drawling in their speech, which they think to be
          eminently religious. But on a week day, if you want to find the
          greatest rogues and cheats, they are some of those men who are so
          sanctimonious in their piety. Now, rest assured, my hearers, that no
          confession of sin can be genuine, unless it be a whole hearted one. It
          is of no use for you to say, |I have sinned,| and then keep on
          sinning. |I have sinned,| say you, and it is a fair, fair face you
          show; but, alas! alas! for the sin you will go away and commit. Some
          men seem to be born with two characters. I remarked when in the
          library at Trinity College, Cambridge, a very fine statue of Lord
          Byron. The librarian said to me, |Stand here, sir.| I looked, and I
          said, |What a fine intellectual countenance! What a grand genius he
          was!| |Come here,| he said, |to the other side.| |Ah! what a demon!
          There stands the man that could defy the deity.| He seemed to have
          such a scowl and such a dreadful leer in his face; even as Milton
          would have painted Satan when he said -- |Better to reign in hell than
          serve in heaven.| I turned away and said to the librarian, |Do you
          think the artist designed this?| |Yes,| he said, |he wished to picture
          the two characters -- the great, the grand, the almost superhuman
          genius that he possessed, and yet the enormous mass of sin that was in
          his soul.| There are some men here of the same sort. I dare say, like
          Balaam, they would overthrow everything in argument with their
          enchantments; they could work miracles; and yet at the same time there
          is something about them which betrays a horrid character of sin, as
          great as that which would appear to be their character for
          righteousness. Balaam, you know, offered sacrifices to God upon the
          altar of Baal: that was just the type of his character. So many do;
          they offer sacrifices to God on the shrine of Mammon; and whilst they
          will give to the building of a church, and distribute to the poor,
          they will at the other door of their counting-house grind the poor for
          bread, and press the very blood out of the widow, that they may enrich
          themselves. Ah! it is idle and useless for you to say, |I have
          sinned,| unless you mean it from your heart. That double minded man's
          confession is of no avail.
        </p>
        <p>The Insincere Man.</p>
        <p>SAUL -- |I have sinned.| -- 1 Samuel 15:24.</p>
        <p>
          III. And now a third character, and a third text. In the first book of
          Samuel, the 15th chap. and 24th verse: |And Saul said unto Samuel, I
          have sinned.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the insincere man -- the man who is not like Balaam, to a
          certain extent sincere in two things; but the man who is just the
          opposite -- who has no prominent point in his character at all, but is
          moulded everlastingly by the circumstances that are passing over his
          head. Such a man was Saul. Samuel reproved him, and he said, |I have
          sinned.| But he did not mean what he said: for if you read the whole
          verse you will find him saying, |I have sinned: for I have
          transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words; because I
          feared the people:| which was a lying excuse. Saul never feared
          anybody; he was always ready enough to do his own will -- he was the
          despot. And just before he had pleaded another excuse, that he had
          saved the bullocks and lambs to offer to Jehovah, and therefore both
          excuses could not have been true. You remember, my friends, that the
          most prominent feature in the character of Saul. was his insincerity.
          One day he fetched David from his bed, as bethought, to put him to
          death in his house. Another time he declares, |God forbid that I
          should do aught against thee, my son David.| One day, because David
          saved his life, he said, |Thou art more righteous than I; I will do so
          no more.| The day before he had gone out to fight against his own
          son-in-law, in order to slay him. Sometimes Saul was among the
          prophets, easily turned into a prophet, and then afterwards among the
          witches; sometimes in one place, and then another, and insincere in
          everything. How many such we have in every Christian assembly; men who
          are very easily moulded! Say what you please to them, they always
          agree with you. They have affectionate dispositions, very likely a
          tender conscience; but then the conscience is so remarkably tender,
          that when touched it seems to give, and you are afraid to probe
          deeper, -- it heals as soon it is wounded. I think I used the very
          singular comparison once before, which I must use again: there are
          some men who seem to have india-rubber hearts. If you do but touch
          them, there is an impression made at once; but then it is of no use,
          it soon restores itself to its original character. You may press them
          whatever way you wish, they are so elastic you can always effect your
          purpose; but then they are not fixed in their character, and soon
          return to be what they were before. O sirs, too many of you have done
          the same; you have bowed your heads in church, and said, |We have
          erred and strayed from thy ways;| and you did not mean what you said.
          You have come to your minister; you have said, |I repent of my sins;|
          you did not then feel you were a sinner; you only said it to please
          him. And now you attend the house of God; no one more impressible than
          you; the tear will run down your cheek in a moment, but yet.
          notwithstanding all that, the tear is dried as quickly as it is
          brought forth, and you remain to all intents and purposes the same as
          you were before. To say, |I have sinned,| in an unmeaning manner, is
          worse than worthless, for it is a mockery of God thus to confess with
          insincerity of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been brief upon this character; for it seemed to touch upon
          that of Balaam; though any thinking man will at once see there was a
          real contrast between Saul and Balaam, even though there is an
          affinity between the two. Balaam was the great bad man, great in all
          he did; Saul was little in everything except in stature, little in his
          good and little in his vice; and he was too much of a fool to be
          desperately bad, though too wicked to be at any time good: while
          Balaam was great in both: the man who could at one time defy Jehovah,
          and yet at another time could say, |If Balak would give me his house
          full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my
          God, to do less or more.|
        </p>
        <p>The Doubtful Penitent.</p>
        <p>ACHAN -- |I have sinned.| -- Joshua 7:20.</p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I have to introduce to you a very interesting case; it is
          the case of the doubtful penitent, the case of Achan, in the book of
          Joshua, the 7th chap. and the 20th verse: -- |And Achan answered
          Joshua, indeed I have sinned.|
        </p>
        <p>
          You know that Achan stole some of the prey from the city of Jericho --
          that he was discovered by lot, and put to death. I have singled this
          case out as the representative of some whose characters are doubtful
          on their death beds; who do repent apparently, but of whom the most we
          can say is, that we hope their souls are saved at last, but indeed we
          cannot tell. Achan, you are aware, was stoned with stones, for
          defiling Israel. But I find in the Mishna, an old Jewish exposition of
          the Bible, these words, |Joshua said to Achan, the Lord shall trouble
          thee this day.| And the note upon it is -- He said this day, implying
          that he was only to be troubled in this life, by being stoned to
          death, but that God would have mercy on his soul, seeing that he had
          made a full confession of his sin.| And I, too, am inclined, from
          reading the chapter, to concur in the idea of my venerable and now
          glorified predecessor, Dr. Gill, in believing that Achan really was
          saved, although he was put to death for the crime, as an example. For
          you will observe how kindly Joshua spoke to him. He said, |My son,
          give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make
          confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not
          from me.| And you find Achan making a very full confession. He says,
          |Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and
          thus have I done. When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish
          garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of
          fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold,
          they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver
          under it.| It seems so full a confession, that if I might be allowed
          to judge, I should say, |I hope to meet Achan the sinner, before the
          throne of God.| But I find Matthew Henry has no such opinion; and many
          other expositors consider that as his body was destroyed, so was his
          soul. I have, therefore, selected his case, as being one of doubtful
          repentance. Ah! dear friends, it has been my lot to stand by many a
          death-bed, and to see many such a repentance as this; I have seen the
          man, when worn to a skeleton, sustained by pillows in his bed; and he
          has said, when I have talked to him of judgment to come, |Sir, I feel
          I have been guilty, but Christ is good; I trust in him.| And I have
          said within myself, | I believe the man's soul is safe.| But I have
          always come away with the melancholy reflection that I had no proof of
          it, beyond his own words; for it needs proof in acts and in future
          life, in order to sustain any firm conviction of a man's salvation.
          You know that great fact, that a physician once kept a record of a
          thousand persons who thought they were dying, and whom he thought were
          penitents; he wrote their names down in a book as those, who, if they
          had died, would go to heaven; they did not die, they lived; and he
          says that out of the whole thousand he had not three persons who
          turned out well afterwards, but they returned to their sins again, and
          were as bad as ever. Ah! dear friends, I hope none of you will have
          such a death-bed repentance as that; I hope your minister or your
          parents will not have to stand by your bedside, and then go away and
          say, |Poor fellow, I hope he is saved. But alas! death-bed repentances
          are such flimsy things; such poor, such trivial grounds of hope, that
          I am afraid, after all, his soul may be lost.| Oh! to die with a full
          assurance; oh! to die with an abundant entrance, leaving a testimony
          behind that we have departed this life in peace! That is a far happier
          way than to die in a doubtful manner, lying sick, hovering between two
          worlds, and neither ourselves nor yet our friends knowing to which of
          the two worlds we are going. May God grant us grace to give in our
          lives evidences of true conversion, that our case may not be doubtful!

        <p>The Repentance of Despair.</p>
        <p>JUDAS -- |I have sinned.| -- Matthew 27:4.</p>
        <p>
          V. I shall not detain you too long, I trust, but I must now give you
          another bad case; the worst of all. It is the REPENTANCE OF DESPAIR.
          Will you turn to the 27th chap. of Matthew, and the 4th verse? There
          you have a dreadful case of the repentance of despair. You will
          recognize the character the moment I read the verse: |And Judas said,
          I have sinned.| Yes, Judas the traitor, who had betrayed his Master,
          when be saw that his Master was condemned, |repented, and brought
          again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
          saying, I have sinned, in that I have betrayed innocent blood, and
          cast down the pieces in the temple, and went| and what? -- | and
          hanged himself.| Here is the worst kind of repentance of all; in fact,
          I know not that I am justified in calling it repentance; it must be
          called remorse of conscience. But Judas did confess his sin, and then
          went and hanged himself. Oh! that dreadful, that terrible, that
          hideous confession of despair. Have you never seen it? If you never
          have, then bless God that you never were called to see such a sight. I
          have seen it once in my life, I pray God I may never see it again, --
          the repentance of the man who sees death staring him in the face, and
          who says, |I have sinned.| You tell him that Christ has died for
          sinners; and he answers, |There is no hope for me; I have cursed God
          to his face; I have defied him; my day of grace I know is past; my
          conscience is seared with a hot iron; I am dying, and I know I shall
          be lost!| Such a case as that happened long ago, you know, and is on
          record -- the case of Francis Spira -- the most dreadful ease,
          perhaps, except that of Judas, which is upon record in the memory of
          man. Oh! my hearers, will any of you have such a repentance? If you
          do, it will be a beacon to all persons who sin in future; if you have
          such a repentance as that, it will be a warning to generations yet to
          come. In the life of Benjamin Keach -- and he also was once of my
          predecessors -- I find the case of a man who had been a professor of
          religion, but had departed from the profession, and had gone into
          awful sin. When he came to die, Keach, with many other friends, went
          to see him, but they could never stay with him above five minutes at a
          time; for he said, |Get ye gone; it is of no use your coming to me; I
          have sinned away the Holy Ghost; I am like Esau, I have sold my
          birthright, and though I seek it carefully with tears, I can never
          find it again.| And then he would repeat dreadful words, like these:
          My mouth is filled with gravel stones, and I drink wormwood day and
          night. Tell me not tell me not of Christ! I know he is a Saviour, but
          I hate him and he hates me. I know I must die; I know I must perish!|
          And then followed doleful cries, and hideous noises, such as none
          could bear. They returned again in his placid moments only to stir him
          up once more, and make him cry out in his despair, |I am lost ! I am
          lost ! It is of no use your telling me anything about it!| Ah! I there
          may be a man here who may have such a death as that; let me warn him,
          ere he come to it ; and may God the Holy Spirit grant that that man
          may be turned unto God, and made a true penitent, and then he need not
          have any more fear; for he who has had his sins washed away in a
          Saviour's blood, need not have any remorse for his sins, for they are
          pardoned through the Redeemer.

        <p>The Repentance of the Saint.</p>
        <p>JOB -- |I have sinned.| -- Job 7:20</p>
        <p>
          VI. And now I come into daylight. I have been taking you through dark
          and dreary confessions; I shall detain you there no longer, but bring
          you out to the two good confessions which I have to read to you. The
          first is that of Job in 7th chap., at the 20th verse: |I have sinned;
          what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?| This is the
          repentance of the saint. Job was a saint, but he sinned. This is the
          repentance of the man who is a child of God already, an acceptable
          repentance before God. But as I intend to dwell upon this in the
          evening, I shall now leave it, for fear of wearying you. David was a
          specimen of this kind of repentance, and I would have you carefully
          study his penitential psalms, the language of which is ever full of
          weeping humility and earnest penitence.
        </p>
        <p>The Blessed Confession.</p>
        <p>THE PRODIGAL -- |I have sinned.| -- Luke 15:18.</p>
        <p>
          VII. I come now to the last instance, which I shall mention; it is the
          case of the prodigal. In Luke xv.18, we find the prodigal says:
          |Father I have sinned.| Oh, here is a blessed confession! Here is that
          which proves a man to be a regenerate character -- | Father, I have
          sinned.| Let me picture the scene. There is the prodigal; he has run
          away from a good home and a kind father, and he has spent all his
          money with harlots, and now he has none left. He goes to his old
          companions, and asks them for relief. They laugh him to scorn. |Oh,|
          says he, |you have drunk my wine many a day; I have always stood
          paymaster to you in all our revelries; will you not help me?| |Get you
          gone| they say; and he is turned out of doors. He goes to all his
          friends with whom he had associated, but no man gives him anything. At
          last a certain citizen of the country said, -- |You want something to
          do, do you? Well go and feed my swine.| The poor prodigal, the son of
          a rich landowner, who had a great fortune of his own, has to go out to
          feed swine; and he a Jew too! -- the worst employment (to his mind,)
          to which he could be put. See him there, in squalid rags, feeding
          swine; and what are his wages? Why, so little, that he |would fain
          have filled his belly with the husks the swine eat, but no man gave to
          him.| Look, there he is, with the fellow commoners of the sty, in all
          his mire and filthiness. Suddenly a thought put there by the good
          Spirit, strikes his mind. |How is it,| says he, |that in my father's
          house there is bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger? I
          will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
          sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be
          called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.| Off he goes. He
          begs his way from town to town. Sometimes he gets a lift on a coach,
          perhaps, but at other times he goes trudging his way up barren hills
          and down desolate vales, all alone. And now at last he comes to the
          hill outside the village, and sees his father's house down below.
          There it is; the old poplar tree against it, and there are the stacks
          round which he and his brother used to run and play; and at the sight
          of the old homestead all the feelings and associations of his former
          life rush upon him, and tears run down his cheeks, and he is almost
          ready to run away again. He says |I wonder whether father's dead? I
          dare say mother broke her heart when I went away; I always was her
          favorite. And if they are either of them alive, they will never see me
          again; they will shut the door in my face. What am I to do? I cannot
          go back, I am afraid to go forward.| And while he was thus
          deliberating, his father had been walking on the housetop, looking out
          for his son; and though he could not see his father, his father could
          see him. Well, the father comes down stairs with all his might, runs
          up to him, and whilst he is thinking of running away, his father's
          arms are round his neck, and he falls-to kissing him, like a loving
          father indeed, and then the son begins, -- |Father, I have sinned
          against heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
          thy son,| and he was going to say, |Make me as one of thy hired
          servants.| But his father puts his hand on his mouth. |No more of
          that,| says he; |I forgive you all; you shall not say anything about
          being a hired servant -- I will have none of that. Come along,| says
          he, |come in, poor prodigal. Ho!| says he to the servants, |bring
          hither the best robe, and put it on him, and put shoes on his poor
          bleeding feet; and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it; and let
          us eat and be merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he
          was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.| Oh, what a
          precious reception for one of the chief of sinners! Good Matthew Henry
          says -- | His father saw him, there were eyes of mercy; he ran to meet
          him, there were legs of mercy; he put his arms round his neck, there
          were arms of mercy; he kissed him, there were kisses of mercy; he said
          to him -- there were words of mercy, -- Bring hither the best robe,
          there were deeds of mercy, wonders of mercy -- all mercy. Oh, what a
          God of mercy he is.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, prodigal, you do the same. Has God put it into your heart? There
          are many who have been running away a long time now. Does God say
          |return?| Oh, I bid you return, then, for as surely as ever thou dost
          return he will take thee in. There never was a poor sinner yet who
          came to Christ, whom Christ turned away. If he turns you away, you
          will be the first. Oh, if you could but try him! |Ah, sir, I am so
          black, so filthy, so vile.| Well come along with you -- you cannot be
          blacker than the prodigal. Come to your Father's house, and as surely
          as he is God he will keep his word -- |Him that cometh unto me I will
          in no wise cast out.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, if I might hear that some had come to Christ this morning, I would
          indeed bless God! I must tell here for the honor of God and Christ,
          one remarkable circumstance, and then I have done. You will remember
          that one morning I mentioned the case of an infidel who had been a
          scorner and scoffer, but who, through reading one of my printed
          sermons, had been brought to God's house and then to God's feet. Well,
          last Christmas day, the same infidel gathered together all his books,
          and went into the market-place at Norwich, and there made a public
          recantation of all his errors, and a profession of Christ, and then
          taking up all his books which he had written, and had in his house, on
          evil subjects, burned them in the sight of the people. I have blessed
          God for such a wonder of grace as that, and pray that there may be
          many more such, who, though they be born prodigal will yet return
          home, saying, |I have sinned.|<br />
