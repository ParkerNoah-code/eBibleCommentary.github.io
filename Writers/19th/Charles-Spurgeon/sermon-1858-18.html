          |No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
          him.| -- John 6:44.
        </p>
        <p>
          COMING to Christ| is a very common phrase in Holy Scripture. It is
          used to express those acts of the soul wherein, leaving at once our
          self-righteousness, and our sins, we fly unto the Lord Jesus Christ,
          and receive his righteousness to be our covering, and his blood to be
          our atonement. Coming to Christ, then, embraces in it repentance,
          self-negation, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and it sums within
          itself all those things which are the necessary attendants of these
          great states of heart, such as the belief of the truth, earnestness of
          prayer to God, the submission of the soul to the precepts of God's
          gospel, and all those things which accompany the dawn of salvation in
          the soul. Coming to Christ is just the one essential thing for a
          sinner's salvation. He that cometh not to Christ, do what he may, or
          think what he may, is yet in |the gall of bitterness and in the bonds
          of iniquity.| Coming to Christ is the very first effect of
          regeneration. No sooner is the soul quickened than it at once
          discovers its lost estate, is horrified thereat, looks out for a
          refuge, and believing Christ to be a suitable one, flies to him and
          reposes in him. Where there is not this coming to Christ, it is
          certain that there is as yet no quickening; where there is no
          quickening, the soul is dead in trespasses and sins, and being dead it
          cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. We have before us now an
          announcement very startling, some say very obnoxious. Coming to
          Christ, though described by some people as being the very easiest
          thing in all the world, is in our text declared to be a thing utterly
          and entirely impossible to any man, unless the Father shall draw him
          to Christ. It shall be our business, then, to enlarge upon this
          declaration. We doubt not that it will always be offensive to carnal
          nature, but, nevertheless, the offending of human nature is sometimes
          the first step towards bringing it to bow itself before God. And if
          this be the effect of a painful process, we can forget the pain and
          rejoice in the glorious consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavour this morning, first of all, to notice man's
          inability, wherein it consists. Secondly, the Father's drawings --
          what these are, and how they are exerted upon the soul. And then I
          shall conclude by noticing a sweet consolation which may be derived
          from this seemingly barren and terrible text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, MAN'S INABILITY. The text says, |No man can come to
          me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.| Wherein does this
          inability lie?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it does not lie in any physical defect. If in coming to Christ,
          moving the body or walking with the feet should be of any assistance,
          certainly man has all physical power to come to Christ in that sense.
          I remember to have heard a very foolish Antinomian declare, that he
          did not believe any man had the power to walk to the house of God
          unless the Father drew him. Now the man was plainly foolish, because
          he must have seen that as long as a man was alive and had legs, it was
          as easy for him to walk to the house of God as to the house of Satan.
          If coming to Christ includes the utterance of a prayer, man has no
          physical defect in that respect, if he be not dumb, he can say a
          prayer as easily as he can utter blasphemy. It is as easy for a man to
          sing one of the songs of Zion as to sing a profane and libidinous
          song. There is no lack of physical power in coming to Christ. All that
          can be wanted with regard to the bodily strength man most assuredly
          has, and any part of salvation which consists in that is totally and
          entirely in the power of man without any assistance from the Spirit of
          God. Nor, again, does this inability lie in any mental lack. I can
          believe this Bible to be true just as easily as I can believe any
          other book to be true. So far as believing on Christ is an act of the
          mind, I am just as able to believe on Christ as I am able to believe
          on anybody else. Let his statement be but true, it is idle to tell me
          I cannot believe it. I can believe the statement that Christ makes as
          well as I can believe the statement of any other person. There is no
          deficiency of faculty in the mind: it is as capable of appreciating as
          a mere mental act the guilt of sin, as it is of appreciating the guilt
          of assassination. It is just as possible for me to exercise the mental
          idea of seeking God, as it is to exercise the thought of ambition. I
          have all the mental strength and power that can possibly be needed, so
          far as mental power is needed in salvation at all. Nay, there is not
          any man so ignorant that he can plead a lack of intellect as an excuse
          for rejecting the gospel. The defect, then, does not lie either in the
          body, or, what we are bound to call, speaking theologically, the mind.
          It is not any lack or deficiency there, although it is the vitiation
          of the mind, the corruption or the ruin of it, which, after all, is
          the very essence of man's inability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permit me to show you wherein this inability of man really does lie.
          It lies deep in his nature. Through the fall, and through our own sin,
          the nature of man has become so debased, and depraved, and corrupt,
          that it is impossible for him to come to Christ without the assistance
          of God the Holy Spirit. Now, in trying to exhibit how the nature of
          man thus renders him unable to come to Christ, you must allow me just
          to take this figure. You see a sheep; how willingly it feeds upon the
          herbage! You never knew a sheep sigh after carrion; it could not live
          on lion's food. Now bring me a wolf; and you ask me whether a wolf
          cannot eat grass, whether it cannot be just as docile and as
          domesticated as the sheep. I answer, no; because its nature is
          contrary thereunto. You say, |Well, it has ears and legs; can it not
          hear the shepherd's voice, and follow him whithersoever he leadeth it
          ?| I answer, certainly; there is no physical cause why it cannot do
          so, but its nature forbids, and therefore I say it cannot do so. Can
          it not be tamed? cannot its ferocity be removed? Probably it may so
          far be subdued that it may become apparently tame; but there will
          always be a marked distinction between it and the sheep, because there
          is a distinction in nature. Now, the reason why man cannot come to
          Christ, is not because he cannot come, so far as his body or his mere
          power of mind is concerned, but because his nature is so corrupt that
          he has neither the will nor the power to come to Christ unless drawn
          by the Spirit. But let me give you a better illustration. You see a
          mother with her babe in her arms. You put a knife into her hand, and
          tell her to stab that babe to the heart. She replies, and very
          truthfully, |I cannot.| Now, so far as her bodily power is concerned,
          she can, if she pleases; there is the knife, and there is the child.
          The child cannot resist, and she has quite sufficient strength in her
          hand immediately to stab it to its heart. But she is quite correct
          when she says she cannot do it. As a mere act of the mind, it is quite
          possible she might think of such a thing as killing the child, and yet
          she says she cannot think of such a thing; and she does not say
          falsely, for her nature as a mother forbids her doing a thing from
          which her soul revolts. Simply because she is that child's parent she
          feels she cannot kill it. It is even so with a sinner. Coming to
          Christ is so obnoxious to human nature that, although, so far as
          physical and mental forces are concerned, (and these have but a very
          narrow sphere in salvation) men could come if they would: it is
          strictly correct to say that they cannot and will not unless the
          Father who hath sent Christ doth draw them. Let us enter a little more
          deeply into the subject, and try to show you wherein this inability of
          man consists, in its more minute particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, it lies in the obstinacy of the human will. |Oh!| saith the
          Arminian, |men may be saved if they will.| We reply, |My dear sir, we
          all believe that; but it is just the if they will that is the
          difficulty. We assert that no man will come to Christ unless he be
          drawn; nay, we do not assert it, but Christ himself declares it -- |Ye
          will not come unto me that ye might have life;' and as long as that
          |ye will not come' stands on record in Holy Scripture, we shall not be
          brought to believe in any doctrine of the freedom of the human will.|
          It is strange how people, when talking about free-will, talk of things
          which they do not at all understand. |Now,| says one, |I believe men
          can be saved if they will.| My dear sir, that is not the question at
          all. The question is, are men ever found naturally willing to submit
          to the humbling terms of the gospel of Christ? We declare, upon
          Scriptural authority, that the human will is so desperately set on
          mischief, so depraved, and so inclined to everything that is evil, and
          so disinclined to everything that is good, that without the powerful.
          supernatural, irresistible influence of the Holy Spirit, no human will
          ever be constrained towards Christ. You reply, that men sometimes are
          willing, without the help of the Holy Spirit. I answer -- Did you ever
          meet with any person who was? Scores and hundreds, nay, thousands of
          Christians have I conversed with, of different opinions, young and
          old, but it has never been my lot to meet with one who could affirm
          that he came to Christ of himself, without being drawn. The universal
          confession of all true believers is this -- |I know that unless Jesus
          Christ had sought me when a stranger wandering from the fold of God, I
          would to this very hour have been wandering far from him, at a
          distance from him, and loving that distance well.| With common
          consent, all believers affirm the truth, that men will not come to
          Christ till the Father who hath sent Christ doth draw them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, not only is the will obstinate, but the understanding is
          darkened. Of that we have abundant Scriptural proof. I am not now
          making mere assertions, but stating doctrines authoritatively taught
          in the Holy Scriptures, and known in the conscience of every Christian
          man -- that the understanding of man is so dark, that hecannot by any
          means understand the things of God until his understanding has been
          opened. Man is by nature blind within. The cross of Christ, so laden
          with glories, and glittering with attractions, never attracts him,
          because he is blind and cannot see its beauties. Talk to him of the
          wonders of the creation, show to him the many-coloured arch that spans
          the sky, let him behold the glories of a landscape, he is well able to
          see all these things; but talk to him of the wonders of the covenant
          of grace, speak to him of the security of the believer in Christ, tell
          him of the beauties of the person of the Redeemer, he is quite deaf to
          all your description; you are as one that playeth a goodly tune, it is
          true; but he regards not, he is deaf, he has no comprehension. Or, to
          return to the verse which we so specially marked in our reading, |The
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
          are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them because they are
          spiritually discerned;| and inasmuch as he is a natural man, it is not
          in his power to discern the things of God. |Well,| says one, |I think
          I have arrived at a very tolerable judgment in matters of theology; I
          think I understand almost every point.| True, that you may do in the
          letter of it; but in the spirit of it, in the true reception thereof
          into the soul, and in the actual understanding of it, it is impossible
          for you to have attained, unless you have been drawn by the Spirit.
          For as long as that Scripture stands true, that carnal men cannot
          receive spiritual things, it must be true that you have not received
          them, unless you have been renewed and made a spiritual man in Christ
          Jesus. The will, then, and the understanding, are two great doors,
          both blocked up against our coming to Christ, and until these are
          opened by the sweet influences of the Divine Spirit, they must be for
          ever closed to anything like coming to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, the affections, which constitute a very great part of man,
          are depraved. Man, as he is, before he receives the grace of God,
          loves anything and everything above spiritual things. If ye want proof
          of this, look around you. There needs no monument to the depravity of
          the human affections. Cast your eyes everywhere -- there is not a
          street, nor a house, nay, nor a heart, which doth not bear upon it sad
          evidence of this dreadful truth. Why is it that men are not found on
          the Sabbath Day universally flocking to the house of God? Why are we
          not more constantly found reading our Bibles? How is it that prayer is
          a duty almost universally neglected? Why is it that Christ Jesus is so
          little beloved? Why are even his professed followers so cold in their
          affections to him? Whence arise these things? Assuredly, dear
          brethren, we can trace them to no other source than this, the
          corruption and vitiation of the affections. We love that which we
          ought to hate, and we hate that which we ought to love. It is but
          human nature, fallen human nature, that man should love this present
          life better than the life to come. It is but the effect of the fall,
          that man should love sin better than righteousness, and the ways of
          this world better than the ways of God. And again, we repeat it, until
          these affections be renewed, and turned into a fresh channel by the
          gracious drawings of the Father, it is not possible for any man to
          love the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Yet once more -- conscience, too, has been overpowered by the fall.
          I believe there is no more egregious mistake made by divines, than
          when they tell people that conscience is the vicegerent of God within
          the soul, and that it is one of those powers which retains its ancient
          dignity, and stands erect amidst the fall of its compeers. My
          brethren, when man fell in the garden, manhood fell entirely; there
          was not one single pillar in the temple of manhood that stood erect.
          It is true, conscience was not destroyed. The pillar was not
          shattered; it fell, and it fell in one piece, and there it lies along,
          the mightiest remnant of God's once perfect work in man. But that
          conscience is fallen, I am sure. Look at men. Who among them is the
          possessor of a |good conscience toward God,| but the regenerated man?
          Do you imagine that if men's consciences always spoke loudly and
          clearly to them, they would live in the daily commission of acts,
          which are as opposed to the right as darkness to light? No, beloved;
          conscience can tell me that I am a sinner, but conscience cannot make
          me feel that I am one. Conscience may tell me that such-and-such a
          thing is wrong, but how wrong it is conscience itself does not know.
          Did any man s conscience, unenlightened by the Spirit, ever tell him
          that his sins deserved damnation? Or if conscience did do that, did it
          ever lead any man to feel an abhorrence of sin as sin? In fact, did
          conscience ever bring a man to such a self-renunciation, that he did
          totally abhor himself and all his works and come to Christ? No,
          conscience, although it is not dead, is ruined, its power is impaired,
          it hath not that clearness of eye and that strength of hand, and that
          thunder of voice, which it had before the fall; but hath ceased to a
          great degree, to exert its supremacy in the town of Mansoul. Then,
          beloved, it becomes necessary for this very reason, because conscience
          is depraved, that the Holy Spirit should step in, to show us our need
          of a Saviour, and draw us to the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Still,| says one, |as far as you have hitherto gone, it appears to me
          that you consider that the reason why men do not come to Christ is
          that they will not, rather than they cannot.| True, most true. I
          believe the greatest reason of man's inability is the obstinacy of his
          will. That once overcome, I think the great stone is rolled away from
          the sepulchre, and the hardest part of the battle is already won. But
          allow me to go a little further. My text does not say,|No man will
          come,| but it says, |No man can come.| Now, many interpreters believe
          that the can here, is but a strong expression conveying no more
          meaning than the word will. I feel assured that this is not correct.
          There is in man, not only unwillingness to be saved, but there is a
          spiritual powerlessness to come to Christ; and this I will prove to
          every Christian at any rate. Beloved, I speak to you who have already
          been quickened by the divine grace, does not your experience teach you
          that there are times when you have a will to serve God, and yet have
          not the power? Have you not sometimes been obliged to say that you
          have wished to believe. but you have had to pray, Lord, help mine
          unbelief?| Because, although willing enough to receive God's
          testimony, your own carnal nature was too strong for you, and you felt
          you needed supernatural help. Are you able to go into your room at any
          hour you choose, and to fall upon your knees and say,|Now, it is my
          will that I should be very earnest in prayer, and that I should draw
          near unto God ?| I ask, do you find your power equal to your will? You
          could say, even at the bar of God himself, that you are sure you are
          not mistaken in your willingness; you are willing to be wrapt up in
          devotion, it is your will that your soul should not wander from a pure
          contemplation of the Lord Jesus Christ, but you find that you cannot
          do that, even when you are willing, without the help of the Spirit.
          Now, if the quickened child of God finds a spiritual inability, how
          much more the sinner who is dead in trespasses and sin? If even the
          advanced Christian, after thirty or forty years, finds himself
          sometimes willing and yet powerless -- if such be his experience, --
          does it not seem more than likely that the poor sinner who has not yet
          believed, should find a need of strength as well as a want of will?
        </p>
        <p>
          But, again, there is another argument. If the sinner has strength to
          come to Christ, I should like to know how we are to understand those
          continual descriptions of the sinner's state which we meet with in
          God's holy Word? Now, a sinner is said to be dead in trespasses and
          sins. Will you affirm that death implies nothing more than the absence
          of a will? Surely a corpse is quite as unable as unwilling. Or again,
          do not all men see that there is a distinction between will and power:
          might not that corpse be sufficiently quickened to get a will, and yet
          be so powerless that it could not lift as much as its hand or foot?
          Have we never seen cases in which persons have been just sufficiently
          re-animated to give evidence of life, and have yet been so near death
          that they could not have performed the slightest action? Is there not
          a clear difference between the giving or the will and the giving of
          power? It is quite certain, however, that where the will is given, the
          power will follow. Make a man willing, and he shall be made powerful;
          for when God gives the will, he does not tantalize man by giving him
          to wish for that which he is unable to do; nevertheless he makes such
          a division between the will and the power, that it shall be seen that
          both things are quite distinct gifts of the Lord God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I must ask one more question: if all that were needed to make a
          man willing, do you not at once degrade the Holy Spirit? Are we not in
          the habit of giving all the glory of salvation wrought in us to God
          the Spirit? But now, if all that God the Spirit does for me is to make
          me willing to do these things for myself, am I not in a great measure
          a sharer with the Holy Spirit in the glory? and may I not boldly stand
          up and say, |It is true the Spirit gave me the will to do it, but
          still I did it myself, and therein will I glory; for if I did these
          things myself without assistance from on high, I will not cast my
          crown at his feet; it is my own crown, I earned it, and I will keep
          it.| Inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is evermore in Scripture set forth as
          the person who worketh in us to will and to do of his own good
          pleasure, we hold it to be a legitimate inference that he must do
          something more for us than the mere making of us willing, and that
          therefore there must be another thing besides want of will in a sinner
          -- there must be absolute and actual want of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, before I leave this statement, let me address myself to you for a
          moment. I am often charged with preaching doctrines that may do a
          great deal of hurt. Well, I shall not deny the charge, for I am not
          careful to answer in this matter. I have my witnesses here present to
          prove that the things which I have preached have done a great deal of
          hurt, but they have not done hurt either to morality or to God's
          Church; the hurt has been on the side of Satan. There are not ones or
          twos but many hundreds who this morning rejoice that they have been
          brought near to God; from having been profane Sabbath-breakers,
          drunkards, or worldly persons, they have been brought to know and love
          the Lord Jesus Christ; and if this be any hurt may God of his infinite
          mercy send us a thousand times as much. But further, what truth is
          there in the world which will not hurt a man who chooses to make hurt
          of it? You who preach general redemption, are very fond of proclaiming
          the great truth of God's mercy to the last moment. But how dare you
          preach that? Many people make hurt of it by putting off the day of
          grace, and thinking that the last hour may do as well as the first.
          Why, if we never preached anything which man could misuse, and abuse,
          we must hold our tongues for ever. Still says one, |Well then, if I
          cannot save myself, and cannot come to Christ, I must sit still and do
          nothing.| If men do say so, on their own heads shall be their doom. We
          have very plainly told you that there are many things you can do. To
          be found continually in the house of God is in your power; to study
          the Word of God with diligence is in your power; to renounce your
          outward sin, to forsake the vices in which you indulge, to make your
          life honest, sober, and righteous, is in your power. For this you need
          no help from the Holy Spirit; all this you can do yourself; but to
          come to Christ truly is not in your power, until you are renewed by
          the Holy Ghost. But mark you, your want of power is no excuse, seeing
          that you have no desire to come, and are living in wilful rebellion
          against God. Your want of power lies mainly in the obstinacy of
          nature. Suppose a liar says that it is not in his power to speak the
          truth, that he has been a liar so long, that he cannot leave it off;
          is that an excuse for him? Suppose a man who has long indulged in lust
          should tell you that he finds his lusts have so girt about him like a
          great iron net that he cannot get rid of them, would you take that as
          an excuse? Truly it is none at all. If a drunkard has become so foully
          a drunkard, that he finds it impossible to pass a public -- house
          without stepping in, do you therefore excuse him? No, because his
          inability to reform, lies in his nature, which he has no desire to
          restrain or conquer. The thing that is done, and the thing that causes
          the thing that is done, being both from the root of sin, are two evils
          which cannot excuse each other, What though the Ethiopian cannot
          change his skin, nor the leopard his spots? It is because you have
          learned to do evil that you cannot now learn to do well; and instead,
          therefore, of letting you sit down to excuse yourselves, let me put a
          thunderbolt beneath the seat of your sloth, that you may be startled
          by it and aroused. Remember, that to sit still is to be damned to all
          eternity. Oh! that God the Holy Spirit might make use of this truth in
          a very different manner! Before I have done I trust I shall be enabled
          to show you how it is that this truth, which apparently condemns men
          and shuts them out, is, after all, the great truth, which has been
          blessed to the conversion of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second point is THE FATHER'S DRAWINGS. |No man can come to me,
          except the Father which hath sent me draw him.| How then does the
          Father draw men? Arminian divines generally say that God draws men by
          the preaching of the gospel. Very true; the preaching of the gospel is
          the instrument of drawing men, but there must be some thing more than
          this. Let me ask to whom did Christ address these words? Why, to the
          people of Capernaum, where he had often preached, where he had uttered
          mournfully and plaintively the woes of the law and the invitations of
          the gospel. In that city he had done many mighty works and worked many
          miracles. In fact, such teaching and such miraculous attestation had
          he given to them, that he declared that Tyre and Sidon would have
          repented long ago in sack-cloth and ashes, if they had been blessed
          with such privileges. Now, if the preaching of Christ himself did not
          avail to the enabling these men to come to Christ, it cannot be
          possible that all that was intended by the drawing of the Father was
          simply preaching. No, brethren, you must note again, he does not say
          no man can come except the minister draw him, but except the Father
          draw him. Now there is such a thing as being drawn by the gospel, and
          drawn by the minister, without being drawn by God. Clearly, it is a
          divine drawing that is meant, a drawing by the Most High God -- the
          First Person of the most glorious Trinity sending out the Third
          Person, the Holy Spirit, to induce men to come to Christ. Another
          person turns round and says with a sneer, |Then do you think that
          Christ drags men to himself, seeing that they are unwilling!| I
          remember meeting once with a man who said to me, Sir, you preach that
          Christ takes people by the hair of their heads and drags them to
          himself| I asked him whether he could refer to the date of the sermon
          wherein I preached that extraordinary doctrine, for if he could, I
          should be very much obliged. However, he could not. But said I, while
          Christ does not drag people to himself by the hair of their heads, I
          believe that, he draws them by the heart quite as powerfully as your
          caricature would suggest. Mark that in the Father's drawing there is
          no compulsion whatever; Christ never compelled any man to come to him
          against his will. If a man be unwilling to be saved, Christ does not
          save him against his will. How, then, does the Holy Spirit draw him?
          Why, by making him willing. It is true he does not use |moral
          suasion;| he knows a nearer method of reaching the heart. He goes to
          the secret fountain of the heart, and he knows how, by some mysterious
          operation, to turn the will in an opposite direction, so that, as
          Ralph Erskine paradoxically puts it, the man is saved |with full
          consent against his will;| that is, against his old will he is saved.
          But he is saved with full consent, for he is made willing in the day
          of God's power. Do not imagine that any man will go to heaven kicking
          and struggling all the way against the hand that draws him. Do not
          conceive that any man will be plunged in the bath of a Saviour's blood
          while he is striving to run away from the Saviour. Oh, no. It is quite
          true that first of all man is unwilling to be saved. When the Holy
          Spirit hath put his influence into the heart, the text is fulfilled --
          |draw me and I will run after thee.| We follow on while he draws us,
          glad to obey the voice which once we had despised. But the gist of the
          matter lies in the turning of the will. How that is done no flesh
          knoweth; it is one of those mysteries that is clearly perceived as a
          fact, but the cause of which no tongue can tell, and no heart can
          guess. The apparent way, however, in which the Holy Spirit operates,
          we can tell you. The first thing the Holy Spirit does when he comes
          into a man's heart is this: he finds him with a very good opinion of
          himself: and there is nothing which prevents a man coming to Christ
          like a good opinion of himself. Why, says man, |I don't want to come
          to Christ. I have as good a righteousness as anybody can desire. I
          feel I can walk into heaven on my own rights.| The Holy Spirit lays
          bare his heart, lets him see the loathsome cancer that is there eating
          away his life, uncovers to him all the blackness and defilement of
          that sink of hell, the human heart, and then the man stands aghast. |I
          never thought I was like this. Oh! those sins I thought were little,
          have swelled out to an immense stature. What I thought was a mole-hill
          has grown into a mountain; it was but the hyssop on the wall before,
          but now it has become a cedar of Lebanon. Oh,| saith the man within
          himself, |I will try and reform; I will do good deeds enough to wash
          these black deeds out.| Then comes the Holy Spirit and shows him that
          he cannot do this, takes away all his fancied power and strength, so
          that the man falls down on his knees in agony, and cries, |Oh! once I
          thought I could save myself by my good works, but now I find that
        </p>
        <p>|Could my tears for ever flow,</p>
        <p>Could my zeal no respite know,</p>
        <p>All for sin could not atone,</p>
        <p>Thou must save and thou alone.'|</p>
        <p>
          Then the heart sinks, and the man is ready to despair. And saith he,
          |I never can be saved. Nothing can save me.| Then, comes the Holy
          Spirit and shows the sinner the cross of Christ, gives him eyes
          anointed with heavenly eye-salve, and says, |Look to yonder cross.
          that Man died to save sinners; you feel that you are a sinner; he died
          to save you.| And he enables the heart to believe, and to come to
          Christ. And when it comes to Christ, by this sweet drawing of the
          Spirit, it finds |a peace with God which passeth all understanding,
          which keeps his heart and mind through Jesus Christ our Lord.| Now,
          you will plainly perceive that all this may be done without any
          compulsion. Man is as much drawn willingly, as if he were not drawn at
          all; and he comes to Christ with full consent, with as full a consent
          as if no secret influence had ever been exercised in his heart. But
          that influence must be exercised, or else there never has been and
          there never will be, any man who either can or will come to the Lord
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And, now, we gather up our ends, and conclude by trying to make a
          practical application of the doctrine; and we trust a comfortable one.
          |Well,| says one, |if what this man preaches be true, what is to
          become of my religion? for do you know I have been a long while
          trying, and I do not like to hear you say a man cannot save himself. I
          believe he can, and I mean to persevere; but if I am to believe what
          you say, I must give it all up and begin again.| My dear friends, it
          will be a very happy thing if you do. Do not think that I shall be at
          all alarmed if you do so. Remember, what you are doing is building
          your house upon the sand, and it is but an act of charity if I can
          shake it a little for you. Let me assure you, in God's name, if your
          religion has no better foundation than your own strength, it will not
          stand you at the bar of God. Nothing will last to eternity, but that
          which came from eternity. Unless the everlasting God has done a good
          work in your heart, all you may have done must be unravelled at the
          last day of account. It is all in vain for you to be a church-goer or
          chapel-goer, a good keeper of the Sabbath, an observer of your
          prayers: it is all in vain for you to be honest to your neighbours and
          reputable in your conversation; if you hope to be saved by these
          things, it is all in vain for you to trust in them. Go on; be as
          honest as you like, keep the Sabbath perpetually, be as holy as you
          can. I would not dissuade you from these things. God forbid; grow in
          them, but oh, do not trust in them, for if you rely upon these things
          you will find they will fail you when most you need them. And if there
          be anything else that you have found yourself able to do unassisted by
          divine grace, the sooner you can get rid of the hope that has been
          engendered by it the better for you, for it is a foul delusion to rely
          upon anything that flesh can do. A spiritual heaven must be inhabited
          by spiritual men, and preparation for it must be wrought by the Spirit
          of God. |Well,| cries another, |I have been sitting under a ministry
          where I have been told that I could, at my own option, repent and
          believe, and the consequence is that I have been putting it off from
          day to day. I thought I could come one day as well as another; that I
          had only to say, |Lord, have mercy upon me,' and believe, and then I
          should be saved. Now you have taken all this hope away for me, sir; I
          feel amazement and horror taking hold upon me.| Again, I say, |My dear
          friend, I am very glad of it. This was the effect which I hoped to
          produce. I pray that you may feel this a great deal more. When you
          have no hope of saving yourself, I shall have hope that God has begun
          to save you. As soon as you say |Oh, I cannot come to Christ. Lord,
          draw me, help me,' I shall rejoice over you. He who has got a will,
          though he has not power, has grace begun in his heart, and God will
          not leave him until the work is finished.| But, careless sinner, learn
          that thy salvation now hangs in God's hand. Oh, remember thou art
          entirely in the hand of God. Thou hast sinned against him, and if he
          wills to damn thee, damned thou art. Thou canst not resist his will
          nor thwart his purpose. Thou hast deserved his wrath, and if he
          chooses to pour the full shower of that wrath upon thy head, thou
          canst do nothing to avert it. If, on the other hand, he chooses to
          save thee, he is able to save thee to the very uttermost. But thou
          liest as much in his hand as the summer's moth beneath thine own
          finger. He is the God whom thou art grieving every day. Doth it not
          make thee tremble to think that thy eternal destiny now hangs upon the
          will of him whom thou hast angered and incensed? Dost not this make
          thy knees knock together, and thy blood curdle? If it does so I
          rejoice, inasmuch as this may be the first effect of the Spirit's
          drawing in thy soul. Oh, tremble to think that the God whom thou hast
          angered, is the God upon whom thy salvation or thy condemnation
          entirely depends. Tremble and |kiss the Son lest he be angry and ye
          perish from the way while his wrath is kindled but a little,|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the comfortable reflection is this: -- Some of you this morning
          are conscious that you are coming to Christ. Have you not begun to
          weep the penitential tear? Did not your closet witness your prayerful
          preparation for the hearing of the Word of God? And during the service
          of this morning, has not your heart said within you, |Lord, save me,
          or I perish, for save myself I cannot?| And could you not now stand up
          in your seat, and sing,
        </p>
        <p>|Oh, sovereign grace my heart subdue;</p>
        <p>I would be led in triumph, too,</p>
        <p>A willing captive of my Lord,</p>
        <p>To sing the triumph of his Word|?</p>
        <p>
          And have I not myself heard you say in your heart -- |Jesus, Jesus, my
          whole trust Is in thee: I know that no righteousness of my own can
          save me, but only thou, O Christ -- sink or swim, I cast myself on
          thee?| Oh, my brother, thou art drawn by the Father, for thou couldst
          not have come unless he had drawn thee. Sweet thought! And if he has
          drawn thee, dost thou know what is the delightful inference? Let me
          repeat one text, and may that comfort thee: |The Lord hath appeared of
          old unto me, saying, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
          therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.| Yes, my poor weeping
          brother, inasmuch as thou art now coming to Christ, God has drawn
          thee; and inasmuch as he has drawn thee, it is a proof that he has
          loved thee from before the foundation of the world. Let thy heart leap
          within thee, thou art one of his. Thy name was written on the
          Saviour's hands when they were nailed to the accursed tree. Thy name
          glitters on the breast-plate of the great High Priest to-day; ay, and
          it was there before the day-star knew its place, or planets ran their
          round. Rejoice in the Lord ye that have come to Christ, and shout for
          joy all ye that have been drawn of the Father. For this is your proof,
          your solemn testimony, that you from among men have been chosen in
          eternal election, and that you shall be kept by the power of God,
          through faith, unto the salvation which is ready to be revealed.
