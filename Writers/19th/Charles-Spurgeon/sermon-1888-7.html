        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2040)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, August 19th, 1888, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
          them| -- Matthew 13:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          |He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the
          word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
          choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful -- Matthew 13:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN that which comes of his sowing is unfruitful, the sower's work is
          wasted: he has spent his strength for nothing. Without fruit the
          sower's work would even seem to be insane, for he takes good wheat,
          throws it away, and loses it in the ground. Preaching is the most idle
          of occupations if the Word is not adapted to enter the heart, and
          produce good results. O my hearers, if you are not converted, I waste
          time and energy in standing here! People might well think it madness
          that one whole day in the week should be given up to hearing
          speeches-madness, indeed, it would be if nothing came of it to
          conscience and heart. If you do not bring forth fruit to holiness, and
          the end is not everlasting life, I would be better employed in
          breaking stones on the road-side than in preaching to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fruit-bearing made the difference appear in the various soils upon
          which the sower scattered seed. You would not so certainly have known
          the quality if you had not seen the failure or success of the seed. We
          do not know your hearts until we see your bearing toward the Gospel.
          If it produces in you holiness and love to God and humanity, then we
          know that there is good soil in you; but if you are merely promising
          people, but not performing people, then we know that the ground of
          your heart is hard, or stony, or thorny. The Word of the Lord tries
          the hearts of the children of men, and in this it is as the fire which
          distinguishes between metal and dross. O my dear hearers, you undergo
          a test today! Peradventure you will be judging the preacher, but a
          greater than the preacher will be judging you, for the Word itself
          shall judge you. You sit here as a jury upon yourselves; your own
          condition will be brought clearly out by the way in which you receive
          or refuse the Gospel of God. If you bring forth fruit to the praise of
          God's grace, well; but if not, however you may seem to hear with
          attention and may retain what you hear in your memories, if no saving
          effect is produced upon your souls we shall know that the soil of your
          heart has not been prepared of the Lord and remains in its native
          barrenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          What fruit have you born hitherto from all your hearing? May I venture
          to put the question to each one of you very pointedly'? Some of you
          have been hearers from your childhood -- are you any the better? What
          long lists of sermons you must have heard by now! Count over your
          Sundays; how many they have been! Think of the good men now in heaven
          to whom you once listened! Remember the tears that were drawn from you
          by their discourses! If you are not saved yet, will you ever be saved?
          If you are not holy yet, will you ever be holy? Why has the Lord spent
          so much on one who makes no return? To what purpose is this waste?
          Surely you will have much to answer for in that great day when the
          servants of God shall give in their accounts, and shall have no joy
          when they come to mention you. How will you excuse yourselves before
          God for having occasioned them so much disappointment?
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time I will only deal with one class of you. I will not speak
          to those of you who hear the Word, and retain none of it because of
          the hardness of your hearts; such are the wayside hearers. Neither
          will I address myself to those who receive the truth with sudden
          enthusiasm, and as readily quit it when trial befalls them; such are
          the rocky-ground hearers. But I will deal with those of you who hear
          the Word attentively, and, in a sense, receive it into your hearts and
          understandings, so that the seed grows in you, though its fruit never
          comes to perfection. You are religious persons, and to all appearance
          you are under the influence of godliness. You exhibit plenty of leaf,
          but there is no corn in the ear, no substance in your Christianity. I
          cannot speak with any degree of physical vigor to you by reason of the
          infirmity under which I struggle; but what I do say to you is steeped
          in earnest desire that the Lord may bless it to you. An eloquent
          congregation will make any preacher eloquent: help me then this
          morning. If you will give me your ear, you will make up for my
          deficiency of tongue: especially if you give to God your hearts, He
          will bless His truth, however feebly I may utter it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I desire to talk to you a little about the seed which you have
          received; secondly about the thorns; thirdly about the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First a little about THE SEED. Remember, first, that it was the
          same seed in every case. Yonder it has brought forth thirty-fold; it
          was the same seed which was lost upon you. In a still better case, the
          seed has brought forth a hundred-fold; it was precisely the same corn
          with which your field has been sown. The sower went to his master's
          granary for all his seed; how is it that in your case it is all lost?
          If there were two Gospels, we might expect two results without fault
          in the soil which failed. But with many of you to whom I speak there
          has been only one Gospel throughout the whole of your lives. You have
          been attending in this house of prayer, where we have never changed
          our seed, but have gone on sowing the one eternal truth of God. Many
          have brought forth fruit a hundred-fold from the seed which has been
          scattered broadcast from this platform. They heard no more than you
          have heard, but how much better they treated it than you have done! I
          want you to consider this. How covered with briars and thorns must
          your mind be that the Gospel which converted your sister or friend
          never touched you! Though you may be nominally a believer in the Word
          of God, it has never so affected you as to make you gracious and holy.
          You are still a hearer only. How is this? The fault is not in the
          seed, for it is the same which has been so useful to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have heard the Gospel with pleasure. |Heard it!| You say, |I heard
          it when a little child.| Your mother brought you to the house of God
          in her arms. You have heard it and still hear it, though it is rather
          like an old song to you: but is this to be all? I am very grateful
          that you do hear the Gospel, for I hope that one of these days God may
          cause it to grow in you and yield fruit. But still a grave
          responsibility is upon you. Think how favored you have been! How will
          you answer for this privilege if it is neglected and rendered useless
          by that neglect? Dear hearers, if we lived in the heart of Africa and
          we died without believing in a Christ of whom we had not heard, we
          could not be blamed for that. But here we are in the heart of London
          where the Gospel is preached in all our streets, and our blood will be
          on our own heads if we perish. Do you mean to go down to hell? Are you
          so desperate that you will go there wearing the garb of Christians? If
          you do persist ruining your souls, my eyes shall follow you with
          tears; and when I cannot warn you any longer, I will weep in secret
          places because of your perversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those described in my text were not only hearers, but in a measure
          they accepted the good Word. The seed fell not only on this ground,
          but into it, so that it began to grow. Of you it is true that you do
          not refuse the Gospel, or raise disputes concerning it. I am glad that
          you have no difficulties about the inspiration of Scripture, or the
          Deity of our Lord, or the fact of His atonement. You do not befog
          yourselves with |modern thought,| but you avow your belief in the old,
          old Gospel. So far so good; but what shall I make of the strange fact
          that your acceptance of the truth has no effect upon you? It is a very
          lamentable case, is it not, that a person should believe the Gospel to
          be true, and yet should live as if it were a lie? If it is the truth,
          why do you not yield obedience to it? The person knows that there is
          an atonement for sin, but he has never confessed his sin and accepted
          the great sacrifice. Those great truths, which circle about the Cross
          like a coronet of stars, he has seen their beauty and enjoyed their
          brilliance, but he has never allowed their light to enter his heart
          and find a reflection in his moral character. This is evil, only evil.
          If you believe the truth, what do you more than the Devil? No, you are
          behind him, for he believes, and trembles, and you have not gone so
          far as the trembling. It should be so, that every great truth which is
          believed should influence the mind, sway the thoughts, and mold the
          life. This is the natural fruitage of great spiritual truth. The
          doctrine of grace, when it takes possession of the mind and governs
          the heart, produces the purest results; but if it is held in
          unrighteousness, it is a curse rather than a blessing to have a head
          knowledge. Is it not a dreadful thing to believe God's revelation
          without receiving God's Spirit? This is to accept a well, but never to
          drink of the water; to accept corn in the barn, and yet die of hunger.
          God have mercy upon the possessors of a dead faith!
        </p>
        <p>
          The seed sown among thorns lived and continued to grow. And in many
          people's minds the Gospel of divine truth is growing after a fashion:
          they understand it better, can defend it more valorously, and speak of
          it more fluently. Moreover, it does influence them in some form and
          degree, for gross vices are forsaken. They are decent imitations of
          believers: you can see the shape of an ear: the stalk has struggled up
          through the thorns until you can see its head, and you are led to
          expect corn. But go to that apparent wheat-ear, and feel it: there are
          the sheaths but there is nothing in them; you have all the makings of
          an ear of wheat, but it will yield no grain. I would speak to those
          before me who, perhaps, have been baptized and are members of the
          church; I want to ask of them a question or two. Do you not think that
          there is a great deal of empty profession nowadays? Do you not think
          that many have a name to live and are dead? |Yes,| say you, |I know a
          neighbor whom I judge to be in that condition.| May not another
          neighbor judge the same of you? Would it not be well to raise the
          question about yourself? Have you really believed in the Lord Jesus?
          Are you truly converted from sin and self? Turn that sharp eye of
          yours homeward for a while. Examine your own actions, and judge your
          condition by them. Put yourself into the crucible. O my God, what if I
          should be a preacher to others, and should be myself a castaway! Will
          not every deacon and elder, and every individual church member, speak
          to himself after the same fashion. You will go to your Sunday school
          class this afternoon; will you be teaching the children what you do
          not know? You mean to go to a meeting this evening and talk to others
          about conversion; will you be exhorting them to that which you have
          never yourself experienced? Will it be so? You do not need fine
          preaching, but you do need probing in the conscience. A thorough
          examination will do the healthy no harm, and it may bless the sick.
          |Lord, let me know the worst of my case,| is one of my frequent
          prayers, and I suggest it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much then about the seed: it was good seed, it was sown, it was
          received by the soil, it grew and promised well, but yet in the end it
          was unfruitful. No doubt multitudes, who receive Christianity, become
          regular attendants at our place of worship, and are honest in their
          moral character; but Christ is not all in all to them. He holds a very
          secondary place in their affections. Their wheat is overshadowed with
          a thicket of thorns, and is so choked that it comes to nothing. Their
          religion is buried beneath their worldliness. Sad will their end be.
          God in mercy save us from such a doom!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, secondly, I would speak a little about THE THORNS. They
          are by Matthew described as |the care of this world, and the
          deceitfulness of riches.| Luke adds, |and pleasures of this life,| and
          Mark still further mentions, |the lusts of other things.| I suppose
          that the sower did not see any thorns when he threw the handful of
          corn; they had all been cut down level with the surface. He probably
          hoped that it was all good ground, and therefore he sowed it little
          suspecting that the thorns were in possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note well that thorns are natural to the soil. Since the fall these
          are the firstborn children of the ground. Any evil which hinders
          religion is not at all an extraordinary thing -- it is what we ought
          to expect among fallen human beings. Grace is an exotic; thorns are
          indigenous. Sin is very much at home in the human heart and, like an
          ill weed, it grows apace. If you wish to go to heaven, I might take a
          little time to show you the way, and I would need to stir you up to
          diligence; but if you must go to hell -- well, |easy is the way to
          destruction| -- it is only a little matter of neglect. |How shall we
          escape if we neglect so great salvation?| Evil things are easy things:
          for they are natural to our fallen nature. Right things are rare
          flowers that need cultivation. If any of you are being injured by the
          cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches, I am not
          astonished; it is natural that it should be so. Therefore, be on your
          guard against these mischiefs. I pray you say to yourself, |Come,
          there is something in this man's talk. He is very slow and dull, but
          still there is something in what he says. I may, after all, be
          tolerating those thorns in my heart which will kill the good seed, for
          I am of like passions and infirmities with other people.| I beseech
          you look to yourselves, that you be not deceived at the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thorns were already established in the soil. They were not only
          the natural inhabitants of the soil, but they were rooted and fixed in
          it. Our sins within us claim the freehold of our faculties, and they
          will not give it up if they can help it. They will not give way to the
          Holy Spirit, or to the new life, or to the influences of divine grace,
          without a desperate struggle. The roots of sin run through and through
          our nature, grasp it with wonderful force, and keep up their grasp
          with marvelous tenacity. O my dear hearer, whoever you may be, you are
          a fallen creature! If you were the Pope himself, or the President of
          the United States, or the Queen of England, it would be true of you
          that you were born in sin and shapen in iniquity, and your
          unregenerate heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
          wicked. The established church of the town of Mansoul has the Devil
          for its archbishop. Sin has enclasped our nature as a boa constrictor
          encircles its victim, and when it has maintained its hold for twenty,
          forty, or sixty years, I hope you are not so foolish as to think that
          holy things will easily get the mastery. Our evil nature is radically
          conservative, and it will endeavor to crush out every attempt at a
          revolution by which the grace of God should reign through
          righteousness. Wherefore, watch and pray, lest temptation choke that
          which is good in you. Watch earnestly, for grace is a tender plant in
          a foreign soil, in an uncongenial clime, while sin is in its own
          element, and is strongly rooted in the soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you know why so many professing Christians are like the thorny
          ground? It is because processes have been omitted which would have
          gone far to alter the condition of things. It was the husbandman's
          business to uproot the thorns, or burn them on the spot. Years ago
          when people were converted, there used to be such a thing as
          conviction of sin. The great subsoil plow of soul-anguish was used to
          tear deep into the soul. Fire also burned in the mind with exceeding
          heat: as people saw sin and felt its dreadful results, the love of it
          was burned out of them. But now we are dinned with braggings about
          rapid salvations. As for myself, I believe in instantaneous
          conversions, and I am glad to see them; but I am still more glad when
          I see a thorough work of grace, a deep sense of sin, and an effectual
          wounding by the law. We shall never get rid of thorns with plows that
          scratch the surface. Those fields grow the best corn which are best
          plowed. Converts are likely to endure when the thorns cannot spring up
          because they have been plowed up. Dear hearer, are you undergoing
          today a very severe conviction of sin? Thank God for it. Are you in
          awful trouble and anguish? Do not think that a calamity has happened
          to you. May God Himself continue to plow you, and then sow you, and
          make sure work in you for years to come! So you see these thorns were
          natives, and old-established natives, and it would have been well had
          they been cut up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thorns were bound to grow. There is an awful vitality in evil.
          First the thorns sent up a few tiny shoots. These shoots branched out,
          and more and more came to keep them company, until the wheat stood as
          a lonely thing in a thicket of briars, and was more and more
          overtopped and shadowed by them. The thorns aspired to the mastery,
          and they soon obtained it; that done, they set to work to destroy the
          wheat. They blocked it up, crowded it out, and some of the thorn
          shoots twisted around it, and held the wheat by the neck until it was
          choked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thorns sucked away all the nutriment from the wheat, and it was
          starved, for there is only a certain quantity of nourishment in the
          soil, and if the thorns have it, the wheat must go without it. There
          is only a certain amount of thought and energy in a person; and if the
          world gets it, Christ cannot have it. If our thoughts run upon care
          and pleasure, they cannot be eager about true religion: is not that
          clear? That is the way in which those thorns served the wheat; they
          starved it by devouring its food, and they choked it by keeping off
          the air and sun; the poor thing became shriveled and weak, and quite
          unable to produce the grain which the sower expected of it. So it is
          with many professing Christians. They are at first worldly, but not so
          very worldly. They are fairly religious, though by no means too
          zealous. They seek the pleasures of the world, but by no means quite
          so much as others we could name. But very soon the thorns grow, and it
          becomes doubtful which will win, sin or grace, the world or Christ.
          Two masters there cannot be, and in this case it is especially
          impossible since neither of the contending powers will brook a rival.
          Sin has sprung from a royal though evil stock, and if it be in the
          heart, it will struggle for the throne. So it came to pass that the
          tares, being tolerated, choked the good seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me describe these thorns a little. Putting together Matthew, Mark,
          and Luke, we find that there were four sorts of thorns. The first is
          called |the care of this world.| This assuredly comes to the poor;
          they are apt to grow anxious and mistrustful about temporal things.
          |What shall we eat? What shall we drink? Wherewithal shall we be
          clothed?| This trinity of doleful questions much afflicts many. But
          anxiety comes to rich people also. Care dwells with wealth as well as
          with poverty. |How shall I get more? How shall I lay it up? How shall
          I still increase it?| -- and so on. It is |the care of the age| which
          we are most warned against. Each age has its own special fret. It is
          not a care for God -- that is not the care of any age; but the care of
          the age is some vanity or another, and as a standing thing it is the
          ambition to keep up with your fellows, to be respectable, and to keep
          up appearances. This is the care which eats as does a canker in the
          case of many. Grim care turns many a black hair white, and furrows
          many a brow. If you let care grow in your soul, it will choke up your
          religion: you cannot care for God and for mammon too. |We must have
          care,| says one. There is a care which is proper, and there is an
          anxiety which is improper. That is proper care which you can cast upon
          God -- |Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.| That
          is an improper care which you dare not take to God but have to bear
          yourself. Take heed of anxiety; it will eat the heart out of your
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were others who felt |the deceitfulness of riches.| Our Lord
          does not say |riches,| but |the deceitfulness of riches.| The two
          things grow together: riches are evermore deceitful. They deceive
          people in the getting of them, for people judge matters very unfairly
          when a prospect of gain is before them. The jingle of the charming
          guinea, or of |the almighty dollar,| makes a world of difference to
          the ear when it is hearing a case. People cannot afford to lose by
          integrity and so they take the doubtful way, and either sail near the
          wind or speculate until it amounts to gambling. They would not endure
          the idea of such conduct were it not that the hope of gain deceives
          them. Our line of conduct ought never to be ruled by gain or loss. Do
          right if the heavens fall. Do no wrong, even though a kingdom should
          be its reward. People turn to Adam Smith's |Wealth of Nations,| a
          wonderful book, and there they find certain laws which I believe to be
          as fixed and unalterable as the laws of gravitation; led on by the
          deceitfulness of riches, people make these laws into an excuse for
          grinding the faces of the poor. They might as well take people to the
          top of a rock, fling them down, and dash them to pieces, and then cry
          out, |This is the natural result of the law of gravitation.| Of
          course, the law of gravitation operates remorselessly, and so will the
          law of supply and demand. We must not use either of these laws as a
          cover for cruelty to the poor and needy, yet many do so through |the
          deceitfulness of riches.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Riches are very deceitful when they are gained, for they breed in men
          and women many vices which they do not themselves suspect. One man is
          purse-proud, but he thinks he is humble. He is a self-made man and
          worships him that made him. Is it not natural that a person should
          worship his maker? In his heart he thinks: |I am somebody. I came up
          to London with half-a-crown in my pocket, and now I could buy a whole
          street!| People ought to respect someone of that kind, ought they not,
          even though he may have made his money by very queer practices? It
          little matters how you make money nowadays; only get it, and you will
          have plenty of admirers and the deceitfulness of riches will enable
          you to admire yourself. With pride comes a desire for wealthy society
          and vain company, and thus again religion receives severe injury.
          There is apt to grow up in the mind an idolatry of this world and its
          treasures. |I don't love money,| says one. |You know it is not money
          that is the root of all evil, but the love of it.| Just so; but are
          you sure that you do not love it? Your thoughts run a good deal after
          it. You hug it rather closely and you find it hard to part with it. I
          will not accuse you, but I would have you awake to the fact that
          riches worm themselves into a person's heart before he is well aware
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may perceive the deceitfulness of riches if you note the excuses
          which people make for getting so much and withholding it from the
          cause of God. |They intend to do a great deal of good with it.| Did
          you hear the Devil laugh? I am not speaking of many dear people in
          this place who are doing a great deal of good with their means, but I
          am speaking of those who are simply living to accumulate wealth, and
          who say that they will one day do a great deal of good with it. They
          say so. Will it ever be more than saying? I fear that in this thing
          many rich people deceive themselves. They go on accumulating the means
          but never using them; making bricks, but never building. All they will
          get with it will be a corner in |The Illustrated London News| to say
          that they died worth so much. O sirs, how can you be content thus to
          have your good things choked? Wherever this deceitfulness of riches is
          allowed the upper hand, it chokes the good seed. A person cannot be
          eager to get, and eager to keep, and eager to increase, and eager to
          become a millionaire, and at the same time be a true servant of the
          Lord Jesus. As the body grows rich, the soul grows poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke tells us of another kind of weed, namely, |the pleasures of this
          life.| I am sure that these thorns play a dreadful part nowadays. I
          have nothing to say against recreation in its proper place. Certain
          forms of recreation are needful and useful; but it is a wretched thing
          when amusement becomes a vocation. Amusement should be used to do us
          good |like a medicine|; it must never be used as the food of the
          individual. From early morning until late at night some spend their
          time in a round of frivolities, or else their very work is simply
          carried on to furnish them funds for their pleasures. This is vicious.
          Many have had all holy thoughts and gracious resolutions stamped out
          by perpetual trifling. Pleasure, so called, is the murderer of
          thought. This is the age of excessive amusement. Everybody craves for
          it, like a babe for its rattle. In the more sober years of our
          fathers, men and women had something better to live for than silly
          sports. The thorns are choking the age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark adds, |and the lusts of other things.| I will not enumerate all
          those other things, but all things except the things of Christ and of
          the Father are |other things.| If anybody spends his life on any
          object, however good, short of the glory of God, the good seed is
          choked by the inferior object. One person is eminently scientific, and
          he will do well if his science is used for holy purposes, but it can
          be used to choke the seed. Another person is a great proficient in the
          arts, and he does well if the arts are used as a mule for Christ to
          ride upon, but if art is to ride upon Christ, then it is ill enough. I
          met with a clergyman many years ago who was going a long distance to
          find a new beetle. He was a great entomologist, and I did not blame
          him for it, for to a thoughtful person entomology may yield many
          profitable lessons. But if he neglected his preaching to catch
          insects, then I do not wonder that a parishioner would wish that the
          beetles would nibble his old sermons, for they were very stale. I call
          it choking the seed when any inferior pursuit becomes the master of
          our minds, and the cause of God and truth takes a secondary place. The
          seed is choked in our souls whenever Christ is not our all in all. You
          see my drift: be it what it may -- gain, glory, study, pleasure -- all
          these may be briers that will choke the seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Jay was never more pleased than when at Bristol he had a note sent
          up to him which ran as follows: |A young man, who is prospering in
          business, begs the prayers of God's people that prosperity may not be
          a snare to him.| Take care that you look thus upon your prosperity. My
          dear friend Dr. Taylor, of New York, speaks of some Christians
          nowadays as having a |butterfly Christianity.| When time, and
          strength, and thought, and talent are all spent upon mere amusement,
          what else are men and women but mere butterflies? |Society| is just a
          mass of idle people keeping each other in countenance. O dear hearers,
          surely we did not come into this world to play away our days! I do not
          think we came into this world either to slave ourselves to death, or
          to rust away in laziness. We have come here as a man enters into the
          porch that he may afterward enter the house. This life is the doorway
          to the palace of heaven. Pass through it in such style that you may
          enter before the King with holy joy. If you give your minds and
          thoughts to these passing things, be they what they may, you will ruin
          your souls, for the good seed cannot grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. So I close in the last place by noticing THE RESULT. The seed was
          unfruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          These briers and thorns could not pull the seed up, or throw it away.
          It remained where it was, but they choked it. So it may be that your
          business, your cares, your pleasures have not torn up your religion by
          the roots -- it is there still, such as it is. But these things
          suffocate your better feelings. Someone that is choked is not good for
          much. If a thief gets into his house, and he desires to defend his
          property, what can he do while he is choked? He must wait until he
          gets his breath again. What an amount of choked religion we have
          around us! It may be alive. I do not know whether it is or not; but it
          looks very black in the face. God save you from having your religion
          choked!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already told you it was drained of all its sustenance. Look at
          many Christians; I call them Christians for they call themselves so. A
          boy in the streets, selling mince pies, kept crying, |Hot mince pies!|
          A person bought one of them, and found it quite cold. |Boy,| said he,
          why did you call these pies hot?| |That's the name they go by, sir,|
          said the boy. So there are plenty of people that are called
          Christians, but they are not Christians -- that's the name they go by;
          but all the substance is drained out of them by other matters. You see
          the shape of a Christian, the make of a Christian, and some of the
          talk of a Christian, but the fruit of a Christian is not there. That
          is the result of the choking by the thorns of care, riches, pleasure,
          and worldliness in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          What life there was in the wheat was very sickly. Let me remind
          certain persons that their spiritual lives are growing weak at this
          time. Morning prayer this morning, how long did it take? Do not grow
          red in the face. I will say no more about it. You are not coming out
          tonight, are you? Half a Sunday is enough worship for you. Would you
          not like to live in some country place where you did not need to go
          out to a place of worship even once? Bible reading, how much do you do
          of that? Family prayer, is that a delight to you? Why, numbers of
          so-called Christians have given up family religion altogether. How
          about week-day services? You are not often at a prayer-meeting. No,
          the distance is too great! Thursday night service? |Well, well, you
          see I might come, but there happens to be a lawn tennis party that
          night.| Will you come in the winter'? |Yes, I would, but then a friend
          drops in, and we have an evening at bagatelle.| How many there are in
          this condition! I am not going to judge them, but I remember that an
          eminent minister used to say, |When weekday services are forsaken,
          farewell to the life of godliness.| Such people never seem to bathe in
          their religion, but they give themselves a wetting with the end of the
          towel; thus they try to look decent, but they are not inwardly
          cleansed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to confessing Christ before men and women, many fall altogether. If
          you were pushed into a corner, and were asked if you are a Christian,
          you would say, |Well, I do go to a place of worship,| but you are by
          no means anxious to own the soft impeachment. Our Salvation Army
          friends are not ashamed of their religion; why should you be? Our
          Quaker friends used to wear broad brims, but they are very properly
          giving up their peculiar garb. I hope it is not to be to you an
          indication that you may conceal your religion and be as much as
          possible like the world. Do you hope to be soldiers and yet never wear
          your regimentals? This is one of the marks of feeble religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to defending the Gospel, where do you see it in this
          age? I hoped that many would be found among Baptists who would care
          for the truth; but now I come to the conclusion that it is with many,
          as with the showman when asked which was Wellington, and which was
          Bonaparte: |Whichever you please, my little dears. Pay your money, and
          take your choice!| Free will or free grace, human merit or Christ's
          atonement, it does not matter now. New theology or old theology, human
          speculation or divine revelation -- who minds? What do they care
          whether God's truth stands or the Devil's lies? I am weary of these
          drivellers! The thorns have choked the seed in the pulpits and in the
          churches as well as in private individuals. Oh, that God would return!
          Oh, that His Spirit would raise up among us people who believe indeed,
          and prove the power of their belief!
        </p>
        <p>
          The fruit of much modern piety is nil. I sat down one day with three
          or four old Christian men. We had no sooner met than we began to speak
          of the providential dealings of God with His people. We related
          instances of answers to prayer, and we spoke of the sovereign grace of
          God, and His faithfulness to His saints. When we had gone a little
          forward in the conversation, one remarked how he had enjoyed the talk.
          |Alas!| said he, |nobody talks about God now. His providence and His
          readiness to hear prayer are seldom mentioned now. The talk is all
          about the markets, and the weather, and Home Rule, and Mr. Gladstone,
          and Disestablishment, but little enough about the Lord Jesus Christ.|
          That witness was true. In old times the Lord's people spoke often one
          to another, and the Lord stood at the window and listened: -- |The
          Lord hearkened, and heard it.| He liked their talk so well that He
          said He would print it -- |A book of remembrance was written before
          him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.|
          Where do you get experimental Christian talk now'? The thorns choke
          holy communion upon the best things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fervent prayer! Mighty prayer! Where do you meet with it? Thank God,
          we have some brothers and sisters here whose prayers could unlock the
          windows of heaven, or shut them up; but it is not so with many. Go to
          the prayer-meetings of most of the churches. What poor things! Of
          course I find in country places that many drop the prayer-meeting
          during hay-time and harvest. In London they do not drop the
          prayer-meetings in summer because they are too small to need dropping.
          They take up the fragment of a prayer-meeting and mend with it the
          worn-out lecture, so that it becomes neither lecture nor prayer
          meeting. How can we expect a blessing when we are too lazy to ask for
          it? Is it not evidence of a dying religion when, to cover their
          carelessness about meeting for prayer, we even hear ministers doubting
          the value of prayer-meetings and calling them |religious expedients|?
        </p>
        <p>
          Where do you meet with intense enjoyment of the things of God? The
          spiritual life is low when there is little delight in holy service.
          Oh, for the old Methodistic fire! Oh, to feel our hearts dance at the
          sound of Jesus' name! Oh, to flame up like beacon fires, and blaze
          toward heaven with holy ecstasy! It is a sorrowful day when religion
          goes abroad without wearing her ornaments of joy. When an army has
          left its flag behind, it has evidently given up all idea of victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is a declension in spiritual life, we cannot expect to see
          deeds of holy consecration. Oh, for men and women who bring their
          alabaster boxes to Jesus! I am glad when I hear this kind of
          lamentation. |My dear sir, I have not done for the Lord what I ought
          to have done. I have been a believer now for many years, but I have
          not given to His cause what I ought to have given; tell me what I can
          do.| There are hopeful signs in such inquiries and therefore they are
          well, but it would be better to begin early and avoid such regrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would put it to you, my dear hearer, have you been fruitful? Have
          you been fruitful with your wealth? Have you been fruitful with your
          talent? Have you been fruitful with your time? What are you doing for
          Jesus now? Salvation is not by doings, you are saved by grace, but if
          you are so saved, prove it by your devoted life. Consecrate yourself
          anew this day wholly to your Master's service. You are not your own,
          but bought with a price, and if you would not be like these
          thorn-choked seeds, live while you live, with all-consuming zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Well,| says one, but there are the thorns.| I know there are. They
          were here when our blessed Lord came among us, and they made Him a
          cruel crown. Are you going to grow more of them? May I urge you to
          give up cultivating thorns'? They are useless; they come to no good.
          Whatever the pursuit is, short of the glory of God, it is a thorn and
          there is no use in it. It will in the end be painful to you as it was
          to your Lord. A thorn will tear your flesh, aye, tear your heart.
          Especially when you come to die will these thorns be in your pillow.
          Even if you die in the Lord, it will grieve your heart to think you
          did not live more to Jesus. If you live for these things, you will rue
          the day, for they are like thorns, painful in the getting, painful in
          the keeping, and painful in the extraction. You who have had a thorn
          in your hand know what I mean. Worldly cares come with pain, they stay
          with pain, and they go with pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, there is a use for thorns. What is that use? First, if you have
          thorns about you today, make a child's use of them. What does a child
          do? If he gets a thorn in his finger, he looks at it, and cries. How
          it smarts! Then he runs off to his mother. That is one of the sweet
          uses of his adversity, it admits him to his mother at once. She might
          say, |What are you coming in for? Run about the garden.| But he cries,
          |Please, mother, I've got a thorn in my finger.| This is quite enough
          argument to secure him the best attention of the queen of the house.
          See how tenderly she takes out the little dagger! Let your cares drive
          you to God. I shall not mind if you have many of them if each one
          leads you to prayer. If every fret makes you lean more on the Beloved,
          it will be a benefit. Thus make good use of the thorns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another service to which thorns may be put is to make a hedge of them,
          to keep the goats of worldly pleasure from eating the young shoots of
          your graces. Let the sorrows of life keep off temptations which else
          might do you serious mischief.
        </p>
        <p>
          May we meet in heaven! Oh, may we all meet in heaven! What a
          congregation I have addressed this morning! I feel overawed as I look
          at you. From the ends of the earth have many of you come. The Lord
          bless you! Strangers are here in vast numbers, for the most of our
          regular hearers are at the seaside. I may never see you again on
          earth. May we all meet in heaven, where thorns will never grow! May we
          be gathered by the angels in that day when the Lord shall say, |Gather
