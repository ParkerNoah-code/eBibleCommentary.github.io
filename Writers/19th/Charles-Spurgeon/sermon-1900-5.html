          |Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath
          hedged in?| -- Job 3:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          I AM VERY THANKFUL that so many of you are glad and happy. There is
          none too much joy in the world, and the more that any of us can
          create, the better. It should be a part of our happiness, and a man
          part of it, to try to make other people glad. |Comfort ye, comfort ye
          my people,| is a commission which many of us ought to feel is
          entrusted to us. If your own cup of joy is full, let it run over to
          others who have a more trying experience. If you yourself are
          privileged to have the flashing eye, and the elastic step, and the
          bounding heart, be mindful to speak words of good cheer to such as are
          in bonds. Feel as if you were bound with them; and try to revive their
          drooping spirits. That is what I am going to aim at to-night, so you
          will excuse me if I bid |good-bye| for a while to you joyous ones, and
          just seek after those who have no such delight as you now possess; but
          who are, on the contrary, suffering from extreme depression of spirit.
          Sometimes, we must single out the wounded ones of the flock; that is
          what I am about to do; yet I feel sure that, while some few will be
          distinctly sought after, there will be something that may be of use to
          the many who are in a less sorrowful condition. The ninety-and-nine
          shall get their full portion although the shepherd goes specially
          after the lost one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question of our text was put by Job when he first opened his mouth
          in the extreme bitterness of his anguish: |Why is light given to a man
          whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?| His case was so sad
          and so trying that life itself became irksome to him. I suppose that
          by |light| here he means the power to see the light, the life which
          lives in the light. |Why,| he asked in his agony, |is that continued
          to a man when God hath filled him with sorrow upon sorrow!| The verses
          preceding our text are to the same effect: |Wherefore is light given
          to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; which long
          for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid
          treasures; which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
          the grave.| The patriarch was weary of living; and perhaps we shall
          not wonder so much at his pitiful lamentation if we recollect the
          extreme distress into which he had been brought. He had lost all his
          property; by stroke upon stroke, all his wealth had been taken away
          from him. He might have borne that if it had been his only loss; but
          close upon the heels of it had come sore bereavement. His happy
          children, for whom he daily cared, and whom he had tenderly loved,
          were all destroyed in a moment, while they were feasting in the house
          of one of their brothers. The calamity seemed all the greater because
          it came in the very midst of their joys. Then as if that was not trial
          enough, Job was himself smitten from head to foot with sore boils. If
          you have ever seen a person in that condition, I am sure that you must
          pity him. There is a dear friend of ours, now with God, whom I visited
          when he was in much the same state as that. Perhaps he had not to
          endure quite all that Job suffered, but something exceedingly like it
          had befallen him. The irritation, the pain, and the depression of
          spirit that come with that particular form of disease, all tend to
          make us treat very gently the petulant expressions of Job. We may not
          excuse them, but only he amongst us that is without; fault may take up
          the first stone to cast at him. I will warrant that, if we had
          suffered as he did, and been brought to poverty, and left childless,
          and then been tortured as he was from head to foot, and even his wife
          rendering him no comfort, but, on the contrary, adding to his grief
          and woe, we might have said even worse things than Job did. For
          remember, dear friends, that he said nothing against God in the time
          of his deepest sorrow. He cursed most vehemently the day of his birth,
          and wished that he had never existed, or that he might speedily pass
          away to sleep with the generations that are dead; and he used unwise
          and foolish expressions, but any of us might have used far worse words
          if we had been in his case, so we will not condemn him, but we will
          see what lessons we can learn from his experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that Job's experience teaches us the very small value of
          temporal things. To have spiritual blessings, and to enjoy them, is
          one thing; but to have earthly things, and to enjoy them, is quite
          another thing. You may have an abundance of them, and yet they may be
          utterly tasteless to you, or they may even be bitter as gall to you,
          and you may curse the day that gave them to you. I am sure that it is
          so, because Job speaks thus concerning life, which is the chief of all
          earthly things. It is true, although Satan said it, |All that a man
          hath will he give for his life;| yet we may be brought into such a
          condition that we may wish that we had never been born. Life itself
          may become, so wearisome to us that we may even wish to escape from
          it, that we may be at rest, as we hope. Job had once enjoyed every
          comfort that heart could desire, and he still had this blessing of
          life left to him; but even that had become curdled and soured, the
          last thing to which a man usually clings had become distasteful and
          disgusting to him, so that he set no store by it, but longed to get
          rid of it. O beloved, seek eternal treasures, for there is no moth
          that can eat them, no rust can mar them, no fermentation or corruption
          can injure them; but, as for the things of time and sense, if you do
          possess them, use them as though you had them not, and never make them
          your gods, for they are but as a shadow that passeth away in a moment.
          They come, and they are gone; and if you make idols of them, the Lord
          may permit you still to retain them, but take away from you all power
          to enjoy them. You may have abundance, and yet not be able to relish
          even the bread you eat, or the drink that refreshes you. You may have
          a loss of health, or a loss of all power to be happy, though
          everything that men think to be the cause of happiness may be laid
          abundantly at your feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this as a preface, I now come to my text, and ask you to notice,
          first, the case which raises the question, secondly, the question
          itself; and, thirdly, answers which may be given to the question: |Why
          is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged
          in?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, notice THE CASE WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION: |Why is light
          given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?|
        </p>
        <p>
          That is to say, |Why does God permit men to live when their souls are
          under deep depression and gloom? Why does he not let them die at once?
          When their days are spent in weariness, and their nights yield them
          neither rest nor refreshment, -- when they look upward, and see
          nothing to give them hope, or onward, and behold nothing but that
          which is even more dreadful than the present, -- why is it that God
          continues life to those who are in such sad circumstances?| Well, dear
          friends, if life were not continued to any but those who are bright of
          eye, and fleet of foot, and joyous of heart, how few would live! And
          if, the first time that darkness fell upon a man's pathway, he were to
          be permitted to die, well, then, the whole population of the globe
          would soon be swept away. If our murmuring the petulance demanded that
          we should die rather than suffer, then we should soon pass away, and
          be gone. But that is the case which is supposed in Job's question, if
          a man find, himself entirely in the dark, if God's presence be
          completely hidden from him, and he can find no joy in anything
          whatever, and his spirit is tossed to and fro with worries and
          perplexities, the question is, |Why does he continue to live?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, further, the, man here described is in such trouble that he can
          see no reason for to trouble. His |way is hid.| Job could not
          perceive, in his own case, any cause for the distress into which he
          had been plunged. as far as he knew, he had walked uprightly. He had
          not sinned so as to be now suffering the result of his sin. He had not
          committed a crime, else he would have understood the punishment when
          it came upon him. He looked back upon all that he had done, and he
          could not, at his first glance, see in himself any cause for his
          affliction. Nor, indeed, dear brethren, was there any cause why all
          these things should have happened to Job by way of punishment, for the
          inspired record concerning him is that he was |perfect and upright,
          and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the devil himself, who kept a sharp look-out with his malicious
          eye, could not find any fault whatsoever with which he could charge
          Job. He deserved the character which God had given to him, though
          Satan did insinuate that he had acted from interested motives, he
          asked, |Doth Job fear God for nought.| That question has always seemed
          to me to be a very crafty one, yet very foolish, for if it could have
          been proved that Job had feared or served God for nought, then the
          devil would have said at once that God was a bad master, and that
          there was no reward for those who served him. But now that he finds
          God putting a hedge of roses round about Job, and sheltering him on
          every side, he declares that Job was only pious because he found it
          profitable. He could find no other fault with him; and even that
          accusation was not true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job, on his part, remembered how he had fed the widow, and succoured
          the fatherless, -- how he had acted justly towards his
          fellow-creatures in the midst of an unjust generation, and how, amidst
          a mass of idolaters, he had worshipped God, and God alone. He had
          never kissed his hand in adoration to the moon, as she walked along
          her shining way in all her queenly brightness, nor had he ever bowed
          himself down to the host of heaven, as nearly all around him had done.
          He stood alone, or almost alone, in that age, as a true and faithful
          servant of Jehovah; yet his sorrows and trials were multiplied. And
          so, his way was hidden, he was hedged in by God, and he could not make
          it out. You know, dear friends, that it is often a great aggravation
          of our troubles when we do not know why they come. A man, when he is
          ill, usually wants to know what is the nature of his disease, and how
          he came to be attacked by it. When we see a person suffering, we
          generally ask |Where did you catch that cold?| or, |What was it that
          brought on that congestion?| We always like to know the cause of the
          complaint, and Job wanted to ascertain the reason for his trouble, but
          he could not find it out, and this rendered it all the more
          mysteriously grievous to him, and therefore he enquired, |Why do I
          continue to live, when I have come into such darkness as this?|
        </p>
        <p>
          It was equally trying to Job that he did not now what to do. There
          seemed to be nothing that he could do. He was stripped of all his
          earthly possessions. Those ashes where he sat formed his uncomfortable
          couch, and the sole property that remained to him was a potsherd, with
          which, in his desperation, he began to scrape himself because of his
          sore boils. What could he do in such a case as that? There was no
          physician there to cure him of his sad complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
          True, there were his three friends; but all that they could do, or, at
          least, the best thing they did, was to sit still, and say nothing.
          When they opened their mouths, it was only to pour vinegar into his
          wounds, and to increase his agony tenfold. What could poor Job do
          under such circumstances. His very helplessness tended to increase his
          wretchedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Am I addressing anyone who is in that kind of perplexity I think I
          hear someone moaning, |I don't know which way to turn. I have done
          everything I can think of, and I cannot tell what is to come next. I
          sit in darkness, and can see no light. Why I am brought to this pass,
          I cannot tell; or what is the reason for it, I cannot make out anyhow.
          If I could light upon some great and grievous fault which had brought
          me where I am, I could understand it; but as it is, I am in thick
          Egyptian night about it all, and I know not what to co. Why does a man
          continue to live when his way is thus hidden, or hedged up.| If that
          is the way you talk, you are in very much the same sort of plight that
          the patriarch was in when he uttered the mournful question which forms
          our text.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was still worse to Job was that he could not see any way out of
          his trouble. He said that God had hedged him in, not with a hedge of
          roses, but with a barrier of briars. Whatever he tried to do, he found
          himself obstructed in doing it. And there are men, now in this world,
          whose sorrows are the more grievous because everything they do to
          alleviate their distress seems only to increase it. Their efforts are
          all fruitless; they are like men who have become entangled in a bog;
          the more they struggle to get out, the deeper they descend; They
          strive to their very utmost, but it is all in vain; they rise up
          early, they sit up late, and they eat the bread of carefulness mingled
          with their tears; but there is a blight on all that they do. Nothing
          prospers with them; they are at their wits end. Then they begin to
          cry, |Oh, that we had never been born, rather than that we should have
          been born to such trouble as this! 'Why is light given to a man whose
          way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?'|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus stated the case which gave rise to Job's question, and I
          should not wonder if I have, at the same time, stated the case of some
          who are here. Do not think it has been a waste of time for any of you
          to hear this sorrowful description of a very sad condition of heart
          and mind. If I should only have been describing one such individual,
          let us all feel sympathy for him or for her, and let us unite in
          breathing the silent petition, |Lord, bring thy servant out of
          prison.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, we are to consider THE QUESTION ITSELF: |Why is
          light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?|
          in other words, Why is the light of life given to him who is ill the
          darkness of misery?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, first, let me say that it is a very unsafe question for anyone
          to ask. Brethren, We are sure to get into mischief as soon as we begin
          catechising God, and asking |why?| and |wherefore?| Such questioning
          comes not well from our lips. He is the Potter, and we are the clay in
          his hands. |Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast
          thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the
          same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonor?|
          God's eternal purposes are a great deep, and when we try to fathom
          them, we utterly fail. Divine Sovereignty is an ocean without a bottom
          and without a shore, and all we can do is to set our sail, and steer
          by the chart which he has given us, and all the while believe that, as
          we sang just now, --
        </p>
        <p>|E'en the hour that darkest seemeth,</p>
        <p>Will his changeless goodness prove;</p>
        <p>From the mist his brightness streameth,</p>
        <p>God is wisdom, God is love.|</p>
        <p>
          Voyaging in that fashion, we shall be safe indeed. But to try to cross
          such a sea, without rudder, or chart, or compass, -- this is a venture
          -- some piece of sailing which we had better not undertake. I tremble
          whenever I have to think of the wondrous ways of God; I mean, when I
          have to think of them after the manner of the reasoner, and not after
          the syle of the believer. Well did Milton describe the fallen spirits
          sitting, in little groups, discussing predestination and the counsels
          of the Eternal. You know how Paul answers the man who calls in
          question the dealings of God either in providence or in grace: |Nay
          but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God.| Job received his
          answer when the Lord spake to him out of the whirlwind, and said, |Who
          is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?| What God
          said to him was not so much a vindication of the ways of providence,
          but a revelation of his matchless power as the Creator and the Ruler
          of the universe; and, though men may not like to hear it, yet there
          is, in the thunder of God's power, an answer, which, though it may not
          always answer the sceptic, but ultimately overpower and silence him.
          As for God's child, he sits down in the shadow of that black cloud
          which is the canopy of Deity, and he is well content to be still in
          the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. Imitate him, my brother,
          and do not keep asking God the why and the wherefore of what he does.
          It is an unsafe thing to ask such questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it reflects upon God. In this question of Job, there is really a
          reflection upon the wisdom of the Almighty. He has given the light of
          life to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God hath hedged in, yet
          Job asks, |Why did he do it?| I think that, far too often, we indulge
          our questionings of divine providence. Is God to stand and answer to
          you and me for what he does V Is he bound to tell us the reason why he
          does it Job's friend Elihu said, |God is greater than man. Why dost
          thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his
          matters.| If there be his equal anywhere, let him meet him in the
          field, and they shall speak together; but to us worms of the dust
          answers shall not be given if we haughtily put questions to him of
          |what?| and |why?| and |wherefore?| To accept the Lord's will with
          absolute submission, is after the manner of the Son of God himself,
          for he prayed, in the hour of his greatest agony, |O my Father, if it
          be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will,
          but as thou wilt.| But to cavil and to question, is after the manner
          of the prince of darkness, who is ever seeking to dispute the
          sovereignty of God. Therefore, beloved, let no question of ours
          reflect upon the Lord's love, or the dispensations of his providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, We may rest quite certain that there must be an answer to
          this question, a good answer, and an answer in harmony with the
          character of God. If there are men and women to be found still sitting
          in the darkness of grief and sorrow, and we ask why they are allowed
          to continue to live, there is a reply possible to that enquiry, and a
          reply consistent with boundless grace and infinite compassion; but,
          mark you, that reply may never be given, or, if it is given, we may be
          incapable of understanding it. There is much that God does that could
          not be understood, even by those great men, of modern times, who would
          fain sit on the throne of the Eternal and judge him, --
        </p>
        <p>|Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,</p>
        <p>Rejudge his judgments, be the god of God.|</p>
        <p>
          I say that there are some answers, which God might give if he pleased,
          but which even they could not comprehend with all their wit and
          wisdom, and you and I must often come to a point where we have to stop
          and say, |We cannot understand this;| and we shall be still wiser if
          we add, |Nor do we wish to do so.| Brothers and sisters, I, for one,
          have had enough of searching into reasons; I am perfectly satisfied to
          accept facts. I am ready to bow my reason before the Lord, and to
          accept whatever he says. If I do not, how little shall I ever know!
          What is there that I do really understand? I confess that I see
          profound mysteries about the commonest phenomena around me; I cannot
          fully comprehend anything when I get right to the bottom of it. There
          is, on every hand, a deep which I cannot fathom; how, then, shall I
          understand the ways of God, and measure him with my finite mind,
          comparing so many inches with the Infinite, weighing so many ounces
          against the Omnipotent, and reckoning so many seconds in contrast with
          the Eternal? No, brethren, for such calculations, you have nothing to
          measure with; you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep,
          yea, bottomless. So, the less of such questions as Job's any of us
          ask, the better, for, even if we had the answer to them, we might not
          be able to understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you also that, however important this question may seem
          to be, it is not the most profitable question. I have heard of a
          farmer, whose boy said to him, |Father, the cows are in the corn;
          however did they get there? Boy,| he replied, |never mind how they got
          there; our work is to get them out as soon as we can.| That is our
          main business also, to get the cows out of the corn; how they got
          there is a matter that can be thought of by-and-by when we have
          nothing else to do. The origin of evil is a point that puzzles a great
          many people; but I hope you will not worry your brain over that
          question; if you do, you will be very foolish. But if you are wise
          men, you will not trouble yourself so much about the origin of evil,
          as about how to conquer it, in yourself, and in others. Get the cows
          out of the corn, and then find out how they got in, if you can, by so
          doing, prevent their getting in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be space enough, and time enough, and better light, to
          discuss these questions when we get up yonder before the throne of the
          Eternal. If their solution is of any real consequence to us, we shall
          get them solved then; but, meanwhile, we are color-blind; or, if we
          are not, it is so dark and so misty here, and we have so many other
          more pressing matters to attend to, that we had better leave these
          whys and wherefores, and rely on the infallible wisdom and the
          infinite love of God. If he has done any -- thing, it is quite certain
          that it is right and just; yea, if it has come from his dear hand, it
          is also gracious and kind. There is more sublimity in being like a
          little child in the presence of the Eternal than there is in trying to
          ape the Deity, for that is but a mockery, -- a thing to be despised;
          -- nay more, it is the greatest insult we can offer to God, and it is
          a pity and a shame that any of us should so live and act. Put aside
          everything of the kind, I implore you, and in very truth submit
          yourselves unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now, in the last place, speaking to the sorrowful person, I
          want to mention SOME ANSWERS WHICH MAY BE GIVEN TO HIS QUESTION. |Why
          do I continue to live,| asks he, |in such sorrow as this? Why does not
          God take from me the light of life when he does not permit me to enjoy
          the light of comfort?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposing that you are a child of God, I will give you one answer
          which ought to satisfy you, though, perhaps, it will not if your
          spirit is rebellious. God wills it. If you are one of his true
          children, that is all the answer that you will require; and you will
          say, with those early christians, |The will of the Lord be done;| and
          with your Lord himself, |Not my will, but thine, be done.| It was
          enough for Christ that his suffering was in accordance with the
          Father's will, so he bowed before him in unquestioning submission; and
          shall not you, the disciple, be content to fare as your Master did?
          Will net you be perfectly satisfied with that which satisfied your
          Lord? it is the will of the Lord; then what need is there of any
          further question if you are his child?
        </p>
        <p>
          But supposing that you are an unconverted person, and you say, |I
          cannot bear to live in such sorrow as this, why is my life prolonged
          |the answer is, |Because of God's mercy to you.| Where would you go to
          be better off than you are here? You who have no hope in Christ, and
          yet who say, |I wish I were dead,| you know not what you are saying.
          You wish you were dead? But what would be your portion after death?
          What! Do you really wish to hear that dread sentence which must be
          passed upon you if you die unregenerate: |Depart from me, ye cursed,
          into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels|? Do you
          really desire to feel the full weight of divine justice! Ah! I hope
          that you are not so foolish. You have spoken in petulance, and do not
          mean what you have said; It may be hard for you to live, but it would
          be harder far for you to die, and then to live for ever in a death
          that never dies. God grant that, you may never know that awful doom!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the answer to your question is that the Lord spares you
          because he would fain save you. You are kept alive that you may hear
          again that voice of mercy which says, |Repent ye, and be converted.|
          |Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.| God comes
          to you in this time of suffering, that he may stop you in your sin,
          and make you think. Even to the most careless and giddy among you,
          during the poignancy of your grief, he says, |Now, my prodigal child,
          thou hast wasted thy substance in riotous living, thy belly is hungry,
          and thou hast nothing with which to fill it; arise, and go unto thy
          Father, for he will receive thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Come then, sorrowful one, it may be that thy sorrows will end when thy
          sins end; certainly, when thou comest to Christ to be forgiven, thou
          shalt find divine consolation, even if all thy griefs do not at once
          disappear. Anyhow, it would be better to be whipped all the way to
          heaven than to be carried down to hell |on flowery beds of ease.| Pray
          this prayer, |O Lord, let me enter into life with one eye and one
          hand, halt or maimed, rather than, having two eyes and two hands, to
          be cast into hell!| This is one answer to your question: the Lord lets
          you live, even though it is in pain and grief, because he has purposes
          of love and mercy towards you. Therefore, be not anxious to de; but be
          thankful that you are still permitted to tarry upon gospel ground.
          Nay, do not be content to tarry there, but fly at once to the God of
          grace; look this very instant to Jesus, for --
        </p>
        <p>|There is life for a look at the Crucified One;</p>
        <p>There is life at this moment for thee;</p>
        <p>Then look, sinner -- look unto him, and be saved --</p>
        <p>Unto him who was nail'd to the tree.|</p>
        <p>
          One believing glance of the eye to him who is the sinner's Substitute,
          and all transgression is forgiven; therefore, yield yourself unto him,
          trust to his finished work, and eternal life is yours. And when you
          have that unspeakable blessing, why need you sorrow more?
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the child of God, to whom I now again speak, if you ask, in a
          timid, childlike way, |Why do I continue to live in such sorrow as I
          have to endure?| I would, as your brother, try to answer you. First,
          it may be that all this trouble has come upon you to let you know what
          is in you. None of us know what there is in us until we are put to the
          test. We are wonderfully sweet-tempered until somebody touches one of
          our sore places; and then, ah, me! there is not much sweetness of
          temper left after that. We are remarkably patient until we get a sharp
          neuralgic pain, perhaps; and then, where is all our boasted patience
          gone. We are very generous until we ourselves are somewhat pinched,
          and then we become as tight-fisted as others whom we have condemned.
          We do not know what is really in us while all goes smoothly and well;
          but sickness, and sorrow, and bereavement, and poverty, and hunger,
          will soon let us see what we are. They make a mental or moral
          photograph of us, and when we look at the picture we say, |Oh, no!
          that cannot be our likeness;| but we look again and again, and then we
          say, |Alas! it is even so; but we did not know we were like that. Now
          we see our faults and our follies. O Lord, thou hast searched us, and
          tried us, and shown us the wicked ways that are in us; now purge us
          from them, and make us clean and pure in thy sight!| That is one
          reason, and a very good reason, for sharp affiiction, -- to let us see
          ourselves as we really are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next is that, often, our trials bring us very near to our God.
          Your children run down the meadow to play, and they get a good way off
          from home in the sunny day, as they ramble along gathering their
          buttercups and daisies; but by-and-by, the sun sets, and night comes
          on, and now they cry to be at home. Just so; and you, in all your
          pretty ways of pleasure in your happy home, though you are a child of
          God, sometimes forget him. Sorrowfully must you remember that sad
          fact. But now the night comes on, and there is danger all around you;
          so you begin to cry for your Father, and you would fain be back to
          fellowship with him; and that is a blessed trouble which brings us
          near to our God. Christ's sheep ought to be thankful for the ugly
          black dog that keeps them from going astray, or fetches them back when
          they have wandered from the Shepherd. Perhaps Christ will call that
          black dog off when he has answered the Master's purpose, and brought
          you near his side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear child of God, anything that promotes your sanctification, or
          increases your spirituality, is a good thing for you. I have had my
          share of physical pain, and perhaps more of it than most who are here;
          and bless God for it. If it comes again, I ask him for grace to bless
          him for it then; and now that it has gone for a while, I freely bless
          him for it, for I cannot tell you all the good that it has wrought in
          me. Oh! how often a proud spirit has been cut back by affliction and
          trial, like a vine that is made to bleed, that the clusters that
          followed the pruning might be all the better and richer! The mown
          grass is very sweet and fine; and so, often, are believers who have
          been deeply tried. This tribulation, as Paul says, |worketh patience;
          and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not
          ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
          Holy Ghost which is given unto us.| Wherefore, bow humbly before the
          Lord, my tried and afflicted friend, and see at least some of the
          reasons why he thus puts you in he dark chamber of tribulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, dear brother, you are being very greatly tried, more than
          most people, to fit you to be an example to others. The Lord means to
          make a veteran of you, so you must be the first in the breach, or you
          must lead the forlorn hope. He puts you on the hardest service because
          he wants others of his children to be able to learn from you. I do not
          know that we should ever have heard anything of Job if it had not been
          for his troubles; he was a most respectable Eastern farmer, with a
          considerable estate, very much like a great many country gentlemen we
          have in England, who may be heard of at the Quarter Sessions, or the
          corn and cattle market, but nothing more will be known of them unless
          you go to the parish church, and see some memorial of them stuck up
          there. Job would have been much the same sort of man as that, -- an
          Oriental magnate, who would have lived, and died, and been forgotten;
          but now his fame will last as long as the world endures, and |ye have
          heard of the patience of Job. You have all heard of it, and Job is one
          of the undying names. So it may be with you, beloved. You are,
          perhaps, to sail through seas of trouble to reach your crown. God
          means to use you in his service, and make you a blessing to others,
          and a teacher of others, by passing you again and again through the
          fire. One of the ancient warriors said, |I cannot use in battle a
          sword that has not been ofttimes annealed; but give me a Damascus
          blade that has been so prepared, and I will cut through a coat of
          mail, or split a man from head to foot at a single stroke. It gets its
          temper and keenness of edge from having slept with the flames again
          and again.| So must it be with believers. Full often, they are unfit
          for God to use till they have been sorely tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, dear friend, the Lord is putting you through all this trouble
          -- (only I hardly like to say it aloud, I must whisper it in your ears
          somehow) because he loves you more than anybody else. Dear Samuel
          Rutherford, when he wrote to a lady who had lost, I think, seven
          children, congratulated her, and said, |I am sure that the
          Well-beloved has a strong affection for your ladyship, for he will
          have all your heart. He has taken away all these children that there
          may not be a nook or a corner for anybody else but for him.| So the
          Lord loves you much, and he is testing you to set whether you can bear
          his will, -- whether you love him so much that you will take up your
          cross, and deny yourself, just as, sometimes, architects will ask for
          their work to be put to the severest possible tests. |Yes,| they say,
          |see what it will really bear.| No doubt Stephenson felt great joy
          when the heaviest train went safely across his tubular bridge; and
          other engineers have said, |Yes, put on as much pressure as you like;
          it will stand it.| Fathers often take delight in the athletic feats of
          their sons, and princes revel in the brave deeds of their warriors;
          and so does the Lord delight to see what his people can do, and he
          often puts upon them more and more, to prove whether they love him so
          much that they can bear it all for his sake. Did not the Lord do this
          to let Satan see that Job did love his God, and would still say,
          |Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
          evil? . . . The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
          the name of the Lord.| We cannot tell what a blessing must come from
          such a state of heart as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very possible, dear friend, also, that God is putting you
          through all this trouble that he may enable you to bear great
          prosperity. Job was to have twice as much as he had ever had before,
          and that was a very great deal, for he said that he washed his steps
          with butter, and the rock poured him out rivers of oil; but how much
          richer he was when everything was doubled! Job was hardly fit to
          manage such a large estate as that until he had been made to see the
          vanity of it all, and to get nearer to his God. So, dear friends, you
          are going to be pressed, and squeezed, and tried, in order that you
          may be fitted to come right out into the front rank, and to be
          magnified and made much of by the Lord your God. I have noticed this
          kind of thing happen more than once. I have seen a man suddenly taken
          from the very dregs of the people, and put up to preach, and he has
          been popular all at once. Nobody has abused him, nobody has said a
          word against him; but, before long, he has passed completely out of
          sight. He could not bear the weight that was put upon him, and gave
          way. You have seen others, who have been called of God to preach the
          Word, and they have been abused year after year. They could not say
          anything that was not perverted; they were called mountebanks,
          impostors, and I know not what. And then, when happier days came, and
          almost all men spoke well of them, they could bear it, for they had
          learnt to despise alike the flatteries and the abuse of men. Now,
          something like that must happen to all God's servants who are to be
          greatly honored. If they are to bear prosperity, they must go through
          the fire first. Perhaps that is what the Lord is doing with you, my
          dear friend; if so, be content with your lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once again, do you not think that the Lord means thus to make you
          more like his dear Son than other people are? Some other Christians
          have not as much trouble to endure as you have. No; why is it? You
          know how an artist can, if he likes, dash off a picture. There! A
          little red, and a little blue, and so on, and it is done; and away it
          goes! Ay, but when he wants to paint something that will be observed
          and admired, then he takes more pains. See how he works at every part
          of it; note what care and what trouble he takes with it. It is the
          same with the lapidary or the sculptor when he has choice work in
          hand; and you are, I hope, the kind of material that will pay for
          cutting and carving; and the Lord is using his chisel upon you more
          than he does upon most folk. He wants to make you just like his dear
          Son; so now he is chipping out a thorn-crown, and you must wear it
          round your brain. He is fashioning the image of his Son out of the
          block of your renewed nature, and you must patiently bear the blows
          from his hammer and chisel till that work is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if I cannot tell you why all this trouble falls to your lot,
          I know it is right, for the Lord has done it, and blessed be his name.
          Aaron held his peace when his two sons died. He got as far as that in
          submission to the will of the Lord; but it will be better still if,
          instead of simply holding your peace, you can bless and praise and
          magnify the Lord even in your sharpest trouble. Oh, may you be
          divinely helped to do so! Let every troubled soul march out of this
          place feeling, |It is good for me that I have been afflicted.| Rise,
          dear friend, out of all despondency and despair, shake yourself from
          the dust, and put on your beautiful garments of praise and joy,
          remembering that --
        </p>
        <p>|The path of sorrow, and that path alone,</p>
        <p>Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown.|</p>
        <p>
          You can see the tracks of the martyrs along the road you are
          journeying; better still, you can see the footprints of the Son of
          God, your Lord and Savior. Therefore, you may rest assured that you
          are on the right road, so press bravely forward on it, and, in due
          time, you will come to that place of which Job said, |There the wicked
          cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest;| and you shall
          be for ever without fault before the throne of God. May he grant this
          happy portion to you all, for his dear Son's sake! Amen.
