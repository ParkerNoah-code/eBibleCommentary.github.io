        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.60)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 6, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am
          God, and there is none else.| -- Isaiah 45:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          SIX years ago to-day, as near as possible at this very hour of the
          day, I was |in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity,|
          but had yet, by divine grace, been led to feel the bitterness of that
          bondage, and to cry out by reason of the soreness of its slavery.
          Seeking rest, and finding none, I stepped within the house of God, and
          sat there, afraid to look upward, lest I should be utterly cut off,
          and lest his fierce wrath should consume me. The minister rose in his
          pulpit, and, as I have done this morning, read this text, |Look unto
          me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and
          there is none else.| I looked that moment; the grace of faith was
          vouchsafed to me in the self-same instant; and now I think I can say
          with truth,
        </p>
        <p>|Ere since by faith I saw the stream</p>
        <p>His flowing wounds supply,</p>
        <p>Redeeming love has been my theme,</p>
        <p>And shall be till I die.|</p>
        <p>
          I shall never forget that day, while memory holds its place; nor can I
          help repeating this text whenever I remember that hour when first I
          knew the Lord. How strangely gracious! How wonderfully and marvelously
          kind, that he who heard these words so little time ago for his own
          soul's profit, should now address you this morning as his hearers from
          the same text, in the full and confident hope that some poor sinner
          within these walls may hear the glad tidings of salvation for himself
          also, and may to-day, on this 6th of January, be |turned from darkness
          to light, and from the power of Satan unto God!|
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were within the range of human capacity to conceive a time when
          God dwelt alone, without his creatures, we should then have one of the
          grandest and most stupendous ideas of God. There was a season when as
          yet the sun had never run his race, nor commenced flinging his golden
          rays across space, to gladden the earth. There was an era when no
          stars sparkled in the firmament. for there was no sea of azure in
          which they might float. There was a time when all that we now behold
          of God's great universe was yet unborn, slumbering within the mind of
          God, as yet uncreate and no-existent; yet there was God, and he was
          |over all blessed for ever;| though no seraphs hymned his praises,
          though no strong-winged cherubs flashed like lightning to do his high
          behests, though he was without a retinue, yet he sat as a king on his
          throne, the mighty God, for ever to be worshipped -- the Dread
          Supreme, in solemn silence dwelling by himself in vast immensity,
          making the placid clouds his canopy, and the light from his own
          countenance forming the brightness of his glory. God was, and God is.
          From the beginning God was God; ere worlds had beginning, he was |from
          everlasting to everlasting.| Now, when it pleased him to create his
          creatures, does it not strike you how infinitely those creatures must
          have been below himself? If you are potters, and you fashion upon the
          wheel a vessel, shall that piece of clay arrogate to itself equality
          with you? Nay, at what a distance will it be from you, because you
          have been in part its creator. So where the Almighty formed his
          creatures, was it not consummate impudence, that they should venture
          for a moment to compare themselves with him? Yet that arch traitor,
          that leader of rebels, Satan, sought to climb to the high throne of
          God, soon to find his aim too high, and hell itself not low enough
          wherein to escape divine vengeance. He knows that God is |God alone.|
          Since the world was created, man has imitated Satan; the creature of a
          day, the ephemera of an hour, has sought to match itself with the
          Eternal. Hence it has even been one of the objects of the great
          Jehovah, to teach mankind that he is God, and beside him there is none
          else. This is the lesson he has been teaching the world since it went
          astray from him. He has been busying himself in breaking down the high
          places, in exalting the valleys, in casting down imaginations and
          lofty looks, that all the world might
        </p>
        <p>|Know that he Lord is God alone,</p>
        <p>He can create, and he destroy.|</p>
        <p>
          This morning we shall attempt to show you, in the first place, how God
          has been teaching this great lesson to the world -- that he is God,
          and beside him there is none else; and then, secondly, the special way
          in which he designs to teach it in the matter of salvation -- |Look
          unto me, and be ye saved: for I am God, and there is none else.|
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, HOW HAS GOD BEEN TEACHING THIS LESSON TO MANKIND?</p>
        <p>
          We reply, he has taught it, first of all, to false gods, and to the
          idolaters who have bowed before them. Man, in his wickedness and sin,
          has set up a block of wood and stone to be his maker, and has bowed
          before it. He hath fashioned for himself out of a goodly tree an image
          made unto the likeness of mortal man, or of the fishes of the sea, or
          of creeping things of the earth, and he has prostrated his body, and
          his soul too, before that creature of his own hands, calling it a god,
          while it had neither eyes to see, nor hands to handle, nor ears to
          hear. But how hath God poured contempt on the ancient gods of the
          heathen? Where are they now? Are they so much as known? Where are
          those false deities before whom the multitudes of Ninevah prostrated
          themselves? Ask the moles and the bats, whose companions they are; or
          ask the mounds beneath which they are buried; or go where the idle
          gazer walketh through the museum -- see them there as curiosities, and
          smile to think that men should ever bow before such gods as these. and
          where are the gods of Persia? Where are they? The fires are quenched,
          and the fire-worshipper hath almost ceased out of the earth. Where are
          the gods of Greece -- those gods adorned with poetry, and hymned in
          the most sublime odes? Where are they? They are gone. Who talks of
          them now, but as things that were of yore? Jupiter -- doth any one bow
          before him? And who is he that adores Saturn? They are passed away,
          and they are forgotten. And where are the gods of Rome? Doth Janus now
          command the temple? or do the vestal virgins now feed their perpetual
          fires? Are there any now that bow before these gods? No, they have
          lost their thrones. And where are the gods of the South Sea Islands --
          those bloody demons before whom wretched creatures prostrated their
          bodies? They have well-nigh become extinct. Ask the inhabitants of
          China and Polynesia where are the gods before which they bowed? Ask,
          and echo says ask, and ask again. They are cast down from their
          thrones; they are hurled from their pedestals; their chariots are
          broken, their sceptres are burnt in the fire, their glories are
          departed; God hath gotten unto himself the victory over false gods,
          and taught their worshippers that he is God, and that beside him there
          is none else. Are their gods still worshipped, or idols before which
          the nations bow themselves? Wait but a little while, and ye shall see
          them fall. Cruel Juggernaut, whose car still crushes in its motion the
          foolish ones who throw themselves before it shall yet be the object of
          derision; and the most noted idols, such as Buddha, and Brahma, and
          Vishnu, shall yet stoop themselves to the earth, and men shall tread
          them down as mire in the streets; for God will teach all men that he
          is God, and that there is none else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark ye, yet again, how God has taught this truth to empires. Empires
          have risen up, and have been gods of the era; their kings and princes
          have taken to themselves high titles, and have been worshipped by the
          multitude. But ask the empires whether there is any beside God? Do you
          not think you hear the boasting soliloquy of Babylon -- |I sit as a
          queen, and am no widow; I shall see no sorrow; I am god, and there is
          none beside me?| And think ye not now, if ye walk over ruined Babylon,
          that ye will meet aught save the solemn spirit of the Bible, standing
          like a prophet gray with age, and telling you that there is one God,
          and that beside him there is none else? Go ye to Babylon, covered with
          its sand, the sand of its own ruins; stand ye on the mounds of
          Nineveh, and let the voice come up -- |There is one God, and empires
          sink before him; there is only one Potentate, and the princes and
          kings of the earth, with their dynasties and thrones, are shaken by
          the trampling of his foot.| Go, seat yourselves in the temples of
          Greece; mark ye there what proud words Alexander once did speak; but
          now, where is he, and where his empire too? Sit on the ruined arches
          of the bridge of Carthage, or walk ye through the desolated theatres
          of Rome, and ye will hear a voice in the wild wind amid those ruins --
          |I am God, and there is none else.| |O city, though didst call thyself
          eternal; I have made thee melt away like dew. Though saidst I sit on
          seven hills, and I shall last forever; ' I have made thee crumble, and
          thou art now a miserable and contemptible place, compared with what
          thou wast. Thou wast once stone, thou madest thyself; I have made thee
          stone again, and brought thee low.| O! how has God taught monarchies
          and empires that have set themselves up like new kingdoms of heaven.
          that he is God, and that there is none else!
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: how has he taught his great truth to monarchs! There are some
          who have been most proud that have had to learn it in a way more hard
          than others. Take, for instance, Nebuchadnezzar. His crown is on his
          head, his purple robe is over his shoulders; he walks through proud
          Babylon, and says, |Is not this great Babylon which I have builded?|
          Do you see that creature in the field there? It is a man. |A man?| say
          you; its hair has grown like eagles' feathers, and its nails like
          birds' claws; it walketh on all-fours, and eateth grass, like an ox;
          it is driven out from men. That is the monarch who said -- |Is not
          this great Babylon that I have builded?| And he is now restored to
          Babylon's palace, that he may |bless the Most High who is able to
          abase those that walk in pride.| Remember another monarch. Look at
          Herod. He sits in the midst of his people, and he speaks. Hear ye the
          impious shout? |It is the voice of God,| they cry, |and not the voice
          of man.| The proud monarch gives not God the glory; he affects the
          God, and seems to shake the spheres, imagining himself divine. There
          is a worm that creepeth into his body, and yet another, and another;
          and ere that sun has set, he is eaten up of worms. Ah! monarch! though
          thoughtest of being a god, and worms have eaten thee! thou hast
          thought of being more than man; and what art thou? Less than man, for
          worms consume thee, and thou art the prey of corruption. Thus God
          humbleth the proud; thus he abaseth the mighty. We might give you
          instances from modern history; but the death of a king is
          all-sufficient to teach this one lesson, if men would but learn it.
          When kings die, and in funeral pomp are carried to the grave, we are
          taught the lesson -- |I am God, and beside me there is none else.|
          When we hear of revolutions, and the shaking of empires -- when we see
          old dynasties tremble, and gray-haired monarchs driven from their
          thrones, then it is that Jehovah seems to put his foot upon land and
          sea, and with his hand uplifted cries -- |Hear! ye inhabitants of the
          earth! Ye are but as grasshoppers; I am God, and beside me there is
          none else.'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: our God has had much to do to teach this lesson to the wise men
          of this world; for as rank, pomp, and power, have set themselves up in
          the place of God, so has wisdom; and one of the greatest enemies of
          Deity has always been the wisdom of man. The wisdom of man will not
          see God. Professing themselves to be wise, wise men have become fools.
          But have ye not noticed, in reading history, how God has abased the
          pride of wisdom? In ages long gone by, he sent mighty minds into the
          world, who devised systems of philosophy. |These systems,| they said,
          |will last forever.| There pupils thought them infallible, and
          therefore wrote their sayings on enduring parchment, saying, |This
          book will last forever; succeeding generations of men will read it,
          and to the last man that book shall be handed down, as the epitome of
          wisdom.| |Ah! but,| said God, |that book of yours shall be seen to be
          folly, ere another hundred years have rolled away.| And so the mighty
          thoughts of Socrates, and the wisdom of Solon, are utterly forgotten
          now; and could we hear them speak, the veriest child in our schools
          would laugh to think that he understandeth more of philosophy than
          they. But when man has found the vanity of one system, his eyes have
          sparkled at another; if Aristotle will not suffice, here is Bacon; now
          I shall know everything; and he sets to work and says that this new
          philosophy is to last forever. He lays his stones with fair colors,
          and he thinks that every truth he piles up is a precious imperishable
          truth. But, alas! another century comes, and it is found to be |wood,
          hay, and stubble.| A new sect of philosophers rise up, who refute
          their predecessors. So too, we have wise men in this day -- wise
          secularists, and so on, who fancy they have obtained the truth; but
          within another fifty years -- and mark that word -- this hair shall
          not be silvered over with gray, until the last of that race shall have
          perished, and that man shall be thought a fool that was ever connected
          with such a race. Systems of infidelity pass away like a dew-drop
          before the sun, for God says, |I am God, and beside me there is none
          else.| This Bible is the stone that shall break in powder philosophy;
          this is the mighty battering ram that shall dash all systems of
          philosophy in pieces; this is the stone that a woman may yet hurl upon
          the head of every Abimelech, and he shall be utterly destroyed. O
          church of God! fear not; thou shalt do wonders; wise men shall be
          confounded, and thou shalt know, and they too, that he is God, and
          that beside him there is none else.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Surely,| says one, |the Church of God does not need to be taught
          this.| Yes, we answer, she does; for of all beings, those whom God has
          made the objects of his grace are perhaps the most apt to forget this
          cardinal truth, that he is God, and that beside him there is none
          else. How did the church in Canaan forget it, when they bowed before
          other gods, and therefore he brought against them mighty kings and
          princes, and afflicted them sore. How did Israel forget it; and he
          carried them away captive into Babylon. And what Israel did, in Canaan
          and in Babylon, that we do now. We too, too often, forget that he is
          God, and beside him there is none else. Doth not the Christian know
          what I mean, when I tell him this great fact? For hath he not done it
          himself? In certain times prosperity has come upon him; soft gales
          have blown his bark along, just where his wild will wished to steer;
          and he has said within himself: |Now I have peace, now I have
          happiness, now the object I wished for is within my grasp, now I will
          say, Sit down, my soul, and take thy rest; eat, drink, and be merry;
          these things will well content me; make thou these thy god, be thou
          blessed and happy.'| But have we not seen our God dash the goblet to
          the earth, spill the sweet wine, and instead thereof fill it with
          gall? and as he has given it to us, he has said -- |Drink it, drink
          it: ye have thought to find a god on earth, but drain the cup and know
          its bitterness.| When we have drunk it, nauseous the draft was, and we
          have cried, |Ah! God, I will drink no more of these things; thou art
          God, and beside thee there is none else.| And ah! how often, too, have
          we devised schemes for the future, without asking God's permission!
          Men have said, like those foolish ones James mentioned, |We will do
          such-and-such things on the morrow; we will buy and sell and get
          gain.| whereas they knew not what was to be on the morrow,, for long
          ere the morrow came they were unable to buy and sell; death had
          claimed them, and a small span of earth held all their frame. God
          teaches his people every day, by sickness, by affliction, by
          depression of spirits, by the forsakings of God, by the loss of the
          Spirit for a season, by the lackings of the joys of his countenance,
          that he is God, and that beside him there is none else. And we must
          not forget that there are some special servants of God raised up to do
          good works, who in a peculiar manner have to learn this lesson. Let a
          man, for instance, be called to the great work of preaching the
          gospel. He is successful; God helped him; thousands wait at his feet,
          and multitudes hang upon his lips; as truly as that man is a man, he
          will have a tendency to be exalted above measure, and too much will he
          begin to look to himself, and too little to his God. Let men speak who
          know, and what they know let them speak; and they will say, |It is
          true, it is most true.| If God gives us a special mission, we
          generally begin to take some honor and glory to ourselves. But in
          review of the eminent saints of God, have you never observed how God
          has made them feel that he was God, and beside him there was none
          else? Poor Paul might have thought himself a god, and been puffed up
          above measure, by reason of the greatness of his revelation, had not
          there been a thorn in the flesh. But Paul could feel that he was not a
          god, for he had a thorn in the flesh, and gods could not have thorns
          in the flesh. Sometimes God teaches the minister, by denying him help
          on special occasions. We come up into our pulpits and say, |oh! I wish
          I could have a good day to-day!| We begin to labor; we have been just
          as earnest in prayer, and just as indefatigable; but it is like a
          blind horse turning round a mill, or like Samson with Delilah: we
          shake our vain limbs with vast surprise, |make feeble fight,| and win
          no victories. We are made to see that the Lord is God, and that beside
          him there is none else. Very frequently God teaches this to the
          minister, leading him to see his own sinful nature. He will have such
          an insight into his own wicked and abominable heart, that he will feel
          as he comes up the pulpit stairs that he does not deserve so much as
          to sit in his pew, much less to preach to his fellows. Although we
          feel always joy in the declaration of God's Word, yet we have known
          what it is to totter on the pulpit steps, under a sense that the chief
          of sinners should scarcely be allowed to preach to others. Ah!
          beloved, I do not think he will be very successful as a minister who
          is not taken into the depths and blackness of his own soul, and made
          to exclaim, |Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is
          this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
          unsearchable riches of Christ.| There is another antidote which God
          applies in the case of ministers. If he does not deal with them
          personally, he raises up a host of enemies, that it may be seen that
          he is God, and God alone. An esteemed friend sent me, yesterday, a
          valuable old Ms. of one of George Whitefield's hymns which was sung on
          Kennington Common. It is a splendid hymn, thoroughly Whitefieldian all
          through. It showed that his reliance was wholly on the Lord, and that
          God was within him. What! will a man subject himself to the calumnies
          of the multitude, will he toil and work day after day unnecessarily,
          will he stand up Sabbath after Sabbath and preach the gospel and have
          his name maligned and slandered, if he has not the grace of God in
          him? For myself, I can say, that were it not that the love of Christ
          constrained me, this hour might be the last that I should preach, so
          far as the ease of the thing is concerned. |Necessity is laid upon us;
          yea, woe is unto us if we preach not the gospel.| But that opposition
          through which God carries his servants, leads them to see at once that
          he is God, and that there is none else. If every one applauded, if all
          were gratified, we should think ourselves God; but, when they hiss and
          hoot, we turn to our God, and cry,
        </p>
        <p>|If on my face, for thy dear name,</p>
        <p>Shame and reproach should be,</p>
        <p>I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,</p>
        <p>If thou'lt remember me.|</p>
        <p>
          II. This brings us to the second portion of our discourse. Salvation
          is God's greatest work; and, therefore, in his greatest work, he
          specially teaches us this lesson, That he is God, and that beside him
          there is none else. Our text tells us how he teaches it. He says,
          |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.| He shows
          us that he is God, and that beside him there is none else, in three
          ways. First, by the person to whom he directs us: |look unto me, and
          be ye saved.| Secondly, by the means he tells us to use to obtain
          mercy: |Look,| simply, |Look.| And thirdly, by the persons whom he
          calls to |look:| |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
          earth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, to whom does God tell us to look for salvation? O, does it
          not lower the pride of man, when we hear the Lord say, |Look unto me,
          and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth?| It is not. |Look to your
          priest, and be ye saved:| if you did, there would be another god, and
          beside him there would be some one else. It is not |Look to yourself;|
          if so, then there would be a being who might arrogate some of the
          praise of salvation. But it is |Look unto me.| How frequently you who
          are coming to Christ look to yourselves. |O!| you say, |I do not
          repent enough.| That is looking to yourself. |I do not believe
          enough.| That is looking to yourself. |I am too unworthy.| That is
          looking to yourself. |I cannot discover,| says another, |that I have
          any righteousness.| It is quite right to say that you have not any
          righteousness; but it is quite wrong to look for any. It is, |Look
          unto me.| God will have you turn your eye off yourself and look unto
          him. The hardest thing in the world is to turn a man's eye off
          himself; as long as he lives, he always has a predilection to turn his
          eyes inside, and look at himself; whereas God says, |Look unto me.|
          From the cross of Calvary, where the bleeding hands of Jesus drop
          mercy; from the Garden of Gethsemane, where the bleeding pores of the
          Saviour sweat pardons, the cry comes, |Look unto me, and be ye saved,
          all the ends of the earth.| From Calvary's summit, where Jesus cries,
          |It is finished,| I hear a shout, |Look, and be saved.| But there
          comes a vile cry from our soul, |Nay, look to yourself! look to
          yourself!| Ah, my hearer, look to yourself, and you will be damned.
          That certainly will come of it. As long as you look to yourself there
          is no hope for you. It is not a consideration of what you are, but a
          consideration of what God is, and what Christ is, that can save you.
          It is looking from yourself to Jesus. P! there be men that quite
          misunderstand the gospel; they think that righteousness qualifies them
          to come to Christ; whereas sin is the only qualification for a man to
          come to Jesus. Good old Crisp says, |Righteousness keeps me from
          Christ: the whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
          Sin makes me come to Jesus, when sin is felt; and, in coming to
          Christ, the more sin I have the more cause I have to hope for mercy.|
          David said, and it was a strange thing, too, |Have mercy upon me, for
          mine iniquity is great.| But, David, why did not you say that it was
          little? Because, David knew that the bigger his sins were, the better
          reason for asking mercy. The more vile a man is, the more eagerly I
          invite him to believe in Jesus. A sense of sin is all we have to look
          for as ministers. We preach to sinners; and let us know that a man
          will take the title of sinner to himself, and we then say to him,
          |Look unto Christ, and ye shall be saved.| |Look,| this is all he
          demands of thee, and even this he gives thee. If thou lookest to
          thyself thou art damned; thou art a vile miscreant, filled with
          loathsomeness, corrupt and corrupting others. But look thou here --
          seest thou that man hanging on the cross? Dost thou behold his
          agonized head dropping meekly down upon his breast? Dost thou see that
          thorny crown, causing drops of blood to trickle down his cheeks? Dost
          thou see his hands pierced and rent, and his blest feet, supporting
          the weight of his own frame, rent well-nigh in twain with the cruel
          nails? Sinner! dost thou hear him shriek, |Eloi, Eloi, lama
          sabbacthani?| Dost thou hear him cry, |It is finished?| Dost thou mark
          his head hang down in death? Seest thou that side pierced with the
          spear, and the body taken from the cross? O, come thou hither! Those
          hands were nailed for thee; those feet gushed gore for thee; that side
          was opened wide for thee; and if thou wantest to know how thou canst
          find mercy, there it is. |Look!| |Look unto me!| Look no longer to
          Moses. Look no longer to Sinai. Come thou here and look to Calvary, to
          Calvary's victim, and to Joseph's grave. And look thou yonder, to the
          man who near the throne sites with his Father, crowned with light and
          immortality. |Look, sinner,| he says, this morning, to you, |Look unto
          me, and be ye saved.| It is in this way God teaches that there is none
          beside him; because he makes us look entirely to him, and utterly away
          from ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But the second thought is, the means of salvation. It is, |Look
          unto me, and be ye saved.| You have often observed, I am sure, that
          many people are fond of an intricate worship, and involved religion,
          one they can hardly understand. They cannot endure worship so simple
          as ours. Then they must have a man dressed in white, and a man dressed
          in black; then they must have what they call an altar and a chancel.
          After a little while that will not suffice, and they must have
          flower-pots and candles. The clergyman then becomes a priest, and he
          must have a variegated dress, with a cross on it. So it goes on; what
          is simply a plate becomes a paten, and what was once a cup becomes a
          chalice; and the more complicated the ceremonies are, the better they
          like them. They like their minister to stand like a superior being.
          The world likes a religion they cannot comprehend. But have you never
          noticed how gloriously simple the Bible is? It will not have any of
          your nonsense; it speaks plain, and nothing but plain things. |Look!|
          There is not an unconverted man who likes this, |Look unto Christ, and
          be ye saved.| No, he comes to Christ like Naaman to Elijah; and , when
          it is said, |Go, wash in Jordan,| he replies, |I verily thought he
          would come and put his hand on the place, and call on the name of his
          God. But the idea of telling me to wash in Jordan, what a ridiculous
          thing! Anybody could do that!| If the prophet had bidden him to do
          some great thing, would he not have done it? Ah! certainly he would.
          And if, this morning, I could preach that any one who walked from here
          to Bath without his shoes and stockings, or did some impossible thing,
          should be saved, you would start off tomorrow morning before
          breakfast. If it would take me seven years to describe the way of
          salvation, I am sure you would all long to hear it. If only one
          learned doctor could tell the way to heaven, how would he be run
          after! And if it were in hard words, with a few scraps of Latin and
          Greek, it would be all the better. But it is a simple gospel that we
          have to preach. It is only |Look!| |Ah!| you say, |Is that the gospel?
          I shall not pay any attention to that.| But why has God ordered you to
          do such a simple thing? Just to take down your pride, and to show you
          that he is God, and that beside him there is none else. O, mark how
          simple the way of salvation is. It is |Look! look! look!| Four
          letters, and two of them alike! |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all
          the ends of the earth.| Some divines want a week to tell what you are
          to do to be saved; but God the Holy Ghost only wants four letters to
          do it. |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.| How
          simple is that way of salvation! and O, how instantaneous! It takes us
          some time to move our hand, buy a look does not require a moment. So a
          sinner believes in a moment; and the moment that sinner believes and
          trusts in his crucified God for pardon, at once he receives salvation
          in full through his blood. There may be one that came in here this
          morning unjustified in his conscience, that will go out justified
          rather than others. There may be some here, filthy sinners one moment,
          pardoned the next. It is done in an instant. |Look! look! look!| And
          how universal it is! Because, wherever I am, however far off, it just
          says, |Look!| It does not say I am to see; it only says, |Look!| If we
          look on a thing in the dark, we cannot see it; but we have done what
          we were told. So, if a sinner only looks to Jesus he will save him;
          for Jesus in the dark is as good as Jesus in the light; and Jesus,
          when you cannot see him, is as good as Jesus when you can. It is only,
          |Look!| |Ah! says one, |I have been trying to see Jesus this year, but
          I have not seen him.| It does not say, see him, but |Look unto him.|
          And it says that they who looked were enlightened. If there is an
          obstacle before you, and you only look in the right direction, it is
          sufficient. |Look unto me.| It is not seeing Christ so much as looking
          after him. The will after Christ, the wish after Christ, the desire
          after Christ, the trusting in Christ, the hanging on Christ, that is
          what is wanted. |Look! look! look!| Ah! if the man bitten by the
          serpent had turned his sightless eyeballs towards the brazen serpent,
          though he had not seen it, he would still have had his life restored.
          It is looking, not seeing, that saves the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We say again, how this humbles a man! There is a gentleman who says,
          |Well, if it had been a thousand pounds that would have saved me, I
          would have thought nothing of it.| But gold and silver is cankered; it
          is good for nothing. |Then, am I to be saved just the same as my
          servant Betty?| Yes, just the same; there is no other way of salvation
          for you. That is to show man that Jehovah is God, and that beside him
          there is none else. The wise man says, |If it had been to work the
          most wonderful problem, or to solve the greatest mystery, I would have
          done it. May I not have some mysterious gospel? May I not believe in
          some mysterious religion?| No; it is |Look!| |What! am I to be saved
          just like that Ragged School Boy, who can't read his letters?| Yes,
          you must, or you will not be saved at all. Another says, |I have been
          very moral and upright; I have observed all the laws of the land; and,
          if there is anything else to do, I will do it. I will eat only fish on
          Fridays, and keep all the fasts of the church, if that will save me.|
          No, sir, that will not save you; your good works are good for nothing.
          |What! must I be saved in the same way as a harlot or a drunkard?|
          Yes, sir; there is only one way of salvation for all. |He hath
          concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.| He hath
          passed a sentence of condemnation on all, that the free grace of God
          might come upon many to salvation. |Look! look! look!| This is the
          simple method of salvation. |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the
          ends of the earth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, lastly, mark how God has cut down the pride of man, and has
          exalted himself by the persons whom he has called to look. |Look unto
          me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.| When the Jew heard
          Isaiah say that, |Ah!| he exclaimed, |you ought to have said, Look
          unto me, O Jerusalem, and be saved.' That would have been right. But
          those Gentile dogs, are they to look and be saved?| |Yes,| says God;
          |I will show you Jews, that, though I have given you many privileges,
          I will exalt others above you; I can do as I will with my own.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, who are the ends of the earth? Why, there are poor heathen
          nations now that are very few degrees removed from brutes, uncivilized
          and untaught; but if I might go and tread the desert, and find the
          Bushman in his kraal, or go to the South Seas and find a cannibal, I
          would say to the cannibal or the Bushman, |Look unto Jesus, and be ye
          saved, all the ends of the earth.| They are some of |the ends of the
          earth,| and the gospel is sent to as much to them as to the polite
          Grecians, the refined Romans, or the educated Britons. But I think
          |the ends of the earth| imply those who have gone the farthest away
          from Christ. I say, drunkard, that means you. You have been staggering
          back. till you have got right to the ends of the earth; you have
          almost had delirium tremens; you cannot be much worse. There is not a
          man breathing worse than you. Is there? Ah! but God, in order to
          humble your pride, says to you, |Look unto me, and be ye saved.| There
          is another who has lived a life of infamy and sin, until she has
          ruined herself, and even Satan seems to sweep her out at the back
          door; but God says, |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
          the earth.| Methinks I see one trembling here, and saying, |Ah, I have
          not been one of these, sir, but I have been something worse; for I
          have attended the house of God, and I have stifled convictions, and
          put off all thoughts of Jesus, and now I think he will never have
          mercy on me.| You are one of them. |Ends of the earth!| So long as I
          find any who feel like that, I can tell them that they are |the ends
          of the earth.| |But,| says another, |I am so peculiar; if I did not
          feel as I do, it would be all very well; but I feel that my case is a
          peculiar one.| That is all right; they are a peculiar people. You will
          do. But another one says, |There is nobody in the world like me; I do
          not think you will find a being under the sun that has had so many
          calls, and put them all away, and so many sins on his head. Besides, I
          have guilt that I should not like to confess to any living creature.|
          One of |the ends of the earth| again; therefore, all I have to do is
          to cry out, in the Master's name, |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all
          the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.| But thou
          sayest, sin will not let thee look. I tell thee, sin will be removed
          the moment thou dost look. |But I dare not; he will condemn me; I fear
          to look.| He will condemn thee more if thou dost not look. Fear, then,
          and look; but do not let thy fearing keep thee from looking. |But he
          will cast me out.| Try him. |But I cannot see him.| I tell you, it is
          not seeing, but looking. |But my eyes are so fixed on the earth, so
          earthly, so worldly.| Ah! but, poor soul, he giveth power to look and
          live. He saith, |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
          earth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Take this, dear friends, for a new year's text, both ye who love the
          Lord, and ye who are only looking for the first time. Christian! in
          all thy troubles through this year, look unto God and be saved. In all
          thy trials and afflictions, look unto Christ, and find deliverance. In
          all thine agony, poor soul, in all thy repentance for thy guilt, look
          unto Christ, and find pardon. This year, remember to put thine eyes
          heavenward, and thine heart heavenward, too. Remember, this day, that
          thou bind round thyself a golden chain, and put one link of it in the
          staple of heaven. Look unto Christ; fear not. There is no stumbling
          when a man walks with his eyes up to Jesus. He that looked at the
          stars fell into the ditch; but he that looks at Christ walks safely.
          Keep your eyes up all the year long. |Look unto him, and be ye saved;|
          and remember that |he is God, and beside him there is none else.| And
          thou, poor trembler, what sayest thou? Wilt thou begin the year by
          looking unto him? You know how sinful you are this morning; you know
          how filthy you are; and yet it is possible that, before you open your
          pew door, and get into the aisle, you will be as justified as the
          apostles before the throne of God. It is possible that, ere you foot
          treads the threshold of your door, you will have lost the burden that
          has been on your back, and you will go on your way, singing, |I am
          forgiven, I am forgiven; I am a miracle of grace; this day is my
          spiritual birthday.| O, that it might be such to many of you, that at
          last I might say, |Here am I, and the children thou hast given me.|
          Hear this, convinced sinner! |This poor man cried, and the Lord
          delivered him out of his distresses.| O, taste and see that the Lord
          is good! Now believe on him; now cast thy guilty soul upon his
          righteousness; now plunge thy black soul into the bath of his blood;
          now put thy naked soul at the door of the wardrobe of his
          righteousness; now seat thy famished soul at the feast of plenty. Now,
          |Look!| How simple does it seem! And yet it is the hardest thing in
          the world to bring men to. They never will do it, till constraining
          grace makes them. Yet there it is, |Look!| Go thou away with that
          thought. |Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:
          for I am God, and there is none else.|
