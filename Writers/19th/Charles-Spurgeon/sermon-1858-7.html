        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.171)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 10, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
          come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I
          have a convenient season, I will call for thee.| -- Acts 24:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE POWER OF THE GOSPEL appears in marvelous grandeur when we see its
          hold upon hearts devoted to it, when subjected to trouble,
          persecution, and sorrow. How mighty must that gospel be, which, when
          it gained an entrance into the heart of Paul, could never be driven
          out of it! For it he suffered the loss of all things, and as for them,
          he counted them but dung, that he might win Christ. To spread the
          truth, he encountered hardships, shipwrecks, perils on the land, and
          perils by sea; but none of these things moved him, neither did he
          count his life dear unto him, that he might win Christ and be found in
          him. Persecution followed persecution; of the Jews was he beaten with
          rods; he was dragged from one tribunal to another; scarce in any city
          did he find anything but bonds and imprisonment awaiting him. Attacked
          in his own country -- he is accused at Jerusalem, and arraigned at
          Cesarea; he is taken from one tribunal to another to be tried for his
          life. But mark how he always maintains the prominent passion of his
          soul. Put him where you may, he seems to be like John Bunyan, who
          says, |If you let me out of prison to-day, I will preach the gospel
          again to-morrow, by the grace of God.| Nay, more than that, he
          preached it in prison, before his judges he proclaimed it. Standing up
          before the Sanhedrim, he cries, |As touching the resurrection of the
          dead I am called in question.| When brought to stand before Agrippa,
          he tells out his conversion, and so sweetly speaks of the grace of
          God, that the king himself cries, |Almost thou persuadest me to be a
          Christian;| and here in our text when he stands before the Roman
          Procurator, to be tried for life or death, instead of entering into a
          defence of himself, he reasons |of righteousness, continence, and
          judgment to come,| until his judge trembles, and he that sits upon the
          throne takes the prisoner's place, while the prisoner judges him, in
          anticipation of that time when the saints shall judge the angels, as
          assessors with Christ Jesus. Why, once let a man believe the gospel,
          and determine to spread it, and it makes him a grand man. If he be a
          man destitute of power, intellect, and talent, it makes him grandly
          earnest in his arduous desire to serve Christ, in the little measure
          in which he can do it; but if he be a gifted man, it sets his whole
          soul on fire, brings out all his powers, develops everything that lies
          hidden, digs up every talent that had been buried in its napkin, and
          spreads out all the gold and silver of man's intellectual wealth,
          displaying it all to the honor of that Christ who has bought it all
          with his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might stay a little while and dilate on this thought, and show you
          how, in all ages, this has been the truth, that the power of the
          gospel has been eminently proved in its influence over men's hearts,
          proving the truth of that utterance of Paul, when he said, that
          neither tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
          nakedness, or peril, or sword, shall separate them from the love of
          God, which is in Jesus Christ their Lord. But instead of so doing, I
          invite you to contemplate the text more closely. We have before us a
          picture containing three characters: Felix and Drusilla, sitting side
          by side upon the judgment-seat; Paul, the prisoner, brought in bound
          in chains, to explain to Drusilla and Felix the doctrines of the
          Christian religion, in order that he might either be acquitted or
          condemned to die. You have a judge extremely willing to put the
          prisoner to death, because he desired to please the Jews; you have, on
          the other hand, a prisoner, unabashed, who comes before the judge, and
          without any debate, begins to unfold the gospel, selecting a certain
          part of it, described in our text as reasoning concerning
          |righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.| The Judge trembles,
          dismisses the prisoner in haste; and promises to attend to him at a
          convenient season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, first then, the appropriate sermon; secondly, the affected
          audience -- for the audience was certainly moved -- |Felix trembled!|
          Note, then, thirdly, the lamentable disappointment. Instead of
          attending to the message, |Go thy way| was all that Paul had.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have an APPROPRIATE SERMON. Just hear for a moment
          or two the history of Felix. Felix was originally a slave; he was
          freed by Claudius, and became one of the infamous favorites of the
          emperor. Of course in that capacity he pandered to his master's vices,
          and was at all times prepared to indulge the Emperor in every lustful
          wish of his abominable heart. Through this he became promoted, and ran
          through the stages of Roman preferment, until he obtained the
          Governorship of Judea. Whilst he was Governor there, he committed
          every act of extortion which it was possible for him to commit, and
          went so far at last, that the Emperor Nero was obliged to recall him,
          and he would have been severely punished for his crimes, had it not
          been for the influence of his brother Pallas, another freedman, with
          the Emperor, through whom he obtained a release, after a sharp rebuke.
          The Roman historian, Tacitus, says, |He exercised, in Judea, the
          imperial functions with a mercenary soul.| You may easily see, then,
          how appropriate was the discourse, when the apostle Paul reasoned
          concerning righteousness. Felix had been an unjust extortioner, and
          the apostle purposely selected righteousness to be a topic of his
          discourse. By the side of Felix sat Drusilla; in the verse preceding
          our text she is called his wife. It is said she was a Jewess. This
          Drusilla was a daughter of Herod Agrippa, the great -- a woman noted
          in that age for her superlative charms, and for her unbridled
          voluptuousness. She had been once affianced to Antioch who, upon the
          death of Herod, refused to marry her. She was afterward married to
          Azizus, the king of the Amesenes, who, although a heathen, was so fond
          of her, that he submitted to the most rigorous rites of the Jewish
          religion in order to obtain her in marriage. His love was but
          ill-requited, for in a little time she deserted him at the instigation
          of Felix, and was, at the time of Paul's address, living as the wife
          of the lascivious Felix. We may easily understand then, why the
          apostle Paul, fixing his stern eye on Drusilla, reasoned concerning
          continence, and publicly rebuked both Felix and Drusilla for the
          shameless lust in which they were publicly living. And then you may
          imagine since there was now a court sitting, and Felix himself was the
          judge, and Paul the prisoner, how strikingly appropriate was the last
          theme -- |judgment to come.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, my brethren, it would not be very hard for us to imagine how
          well the apostle handled this subject. I can conceive that Felix
          expected to have a grand disquisition upon some recondite themes of
          the gospel. Possibly he expected that the apostle Paul would reason
          concerning the resurrection of the dead. He thought perhaps that
          predestination, election, and free will would be the topics or the
          apostles discourse. |Surely,| thought he, |he will tell me those deep
          and hidden matters in which the gospel of Jesus differs from Judaism.|
          Not so. In another place, on Mar's Hill, the apostle would speak of
          resurrection; in another place he could speak of election, and declare
          that God was the potter, and man was but the clay. This was not the
          place for that; and this was not the time for such subjects; this was
          the time for preaching the plain precepts of the gospel, and for
          dealing sternly with a wicked man who sat in eminent power. Conceive
          then, the pointed manner of his opening discourse -- How he would
          address Felix concerning righteousness. I can imagine how he would
          bring before the mind of Felix, the widow who had been defrauded of
          inheritance, the fatherless children, who, cast from affluence, were
          led to beg their bread. I can suppose how he brought before the mind
          of that base man the many bribes that he had taken, when he sat upon
          his judgment-seat. He would recall to him the false decisions that he
          had given; he would remind him how the Jews, as a nation had been
          oppressed -- how by taxation, they had been ground to the earth; he
          would bring before him one scene after another, where avarice had
          overridden equity, boldly and sternly depicting the exact character of
          the man; and then, at the end, declaring that such men could have no
          inheritance in the kingdom of God -- bidding him repent of this his
          wickedness, that his sins might be forgiven him. Then gently and
          delicately turning to the other subject, I can imagine how he would
          fix his eyes upon Drusilla, and remind her that she had lost
          everything for which a woman ought to live, and solemnly bring the
          most powerful motives to bear upon her lascivious heart; and then
          turning to Felix, would remind him that adulterers, fornicators, and
          unclean persons, have no inheritance in the kingdom of God --
          reminding him how the vices of a ruler would tend to pollute a nation,
          and how the iniquities of the nation of the Jews must, in a great
          measure, be laid to his charge. I can conceive how, for a moment,
          Felix would bite his lips. Paul gave him no time for anger and
          passion; for in a moment, in a fury of impassioned eloquence, he
          introduced the |judgment to come.| He made Felix think he saw the
          great white throne, the books opened, and himself arraigned before his
          judge: he made him hear the voices of the trumpet -- the |Come ye
          blessed| -- the |Depart ye cursed.| He petrified him, nailed him to
          his seat, opened his ears, and made them listen, while with stern and
          impassioned earnestness, though his hands were bound with chains, he
          used the liberty of the gospel in upbraiding him. Well do I conceive
          that then Felix began to tremble. He that had been base, and mean, and
          perfidious, trembled like a coward slave, as he really was; and though
          sitting on throne, he pictured himself already damned. What he next
          would have done we can not tell, if the devil had not then suggested
          to him that it was time to rise; for in hot haste he and Drusilla left
          the throne. |Go thy way for this time; when I have convenient season,
          I will call for thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear me, then, brethren! What the apostle Paul did, every minister
          ought to do. He selected a topic appropriate to his audience. It is
          ours ever to do the same. But are there not to be found many ministers
          who, if they addressed kings and princes, would pour out before them
          the vilest adulation and flattery that ever came from mortal lips? Are
          there not many who, when they are aware the great and mighty ones are
          listening to them, trim their doctrine, cut the edges of their speech,
          and endeavor in some way or other to make themselves pleasing to their
          audience? Can there not be found many ministers who, if addressing an
          Antinomian audience, would confine themselves strictly to
          predestination and reprobation? and ministers who, if they addressed
          an audience of philosophers, would just talk about morality but never
          mention such words as the covenant of grace and salvation by blood?
          Are there not some to be found, who think the highest object of the
          minister is to attract the multitude and then to please them? O my
          God! how solemnly ought each of us to bewail our sin, if we feel that
          we have been guilty in this matter. What is it to have pleased men? Is
          there aught in it that can make our head lie easy on the pillow of our
          death? Is there aught in it that can give us boldness in the day of
          judgment, or cause us happiness when we face thy tribunal, O Judge of
          quick and dead? No, my brethren, we must always take our texts so that
          we may bear upon our hearers with all our might. I hope I may never
          preach before a congregation -- I desire always to preach to you; nor
          do I wish to exhibit powers of eloquence, nor would I even pretend to
          exhibit any depth of learning. I would simply say, |Hear me, my fellow
          men, for God doth send me unto you. There are some things that concern
          you; I will tell you of them. You are dying; many of you when you die
          must perish for ever; it is not for me to be amusing you with some
          deep things that may instruct your intellect but do not enter your
          hearts; it is for me to fit the arrow to the string and send it home
          -- to unsheathe the sword -- be the scabbard never so glittering, to
          cast it aside, and let the majesty of naked truth smite at your
          hearts; for in the day of judgment aught beside personal home-speaking
          will be consumed as wood, and hay, and stubble; but these shall abide,
          like the gold and silver and precious stones that can not be consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some men will say, |Sir, ministers ought not to be personal.|
          Ministers ought to be personal, and they will never be true to their
          Master till they are. I admire John Knox for going, Bible in hand, to
          Queen Mary, and sternly upbraiding her. I admit I do not exactly love
          the way in which he did it; but the thing itself I love. The woman had
          been a sinner, and he told her so flat to her face. But now we poor
          graven sons of nobodies have to stand and talk about generalities; we
          are afraid to point you out and tell you of your sins personally. But,
          blessed be God, from that fear I have been delivered long ago. There
          walketh not a man on the surface of this earth whom I dare not
          reprove. There are none of you, however connected with me by ties of
          profession or in any other respect, that I would blush to speak
          personally to, as to the things of the kingdom of God; and it is only
          by being bold, courageous, and sending home the truth, that we shall
          at last be free from the blood of our hearers. May God grant us the
          power of Paul, that we may reason on appropriate subjects, and not
          select generalities, when we ought to be pushing home truths to the
          consciences of our hearers. After all, the apostle Paul needs no
          eulogy. The best eulogy that could be passed on the apostle was the
          fact that |Felix trembled.| And that brings us to the second part of
          our subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. |FELIX TREMBLED.| Yes, the poor prisoner, having nought wherewith
          to assist him in the delivery of the truth but having everything to
          his disadvantage -- the chain, the prison dress, the character of one
          that had stirred up sedition in a nation -- this poor prisoner, with
          believing hand, laid hold on the sword of truth, and with this he did
          divide in sunder the joints and marrow. He did beard the lion in his
          den. Even now I see him look the governor sternly in the face, attack
          him in his heart, drive him from his excuses, push the word home at
          the point of the bayonet of truth, drive him from every refuge of
          lies, and make him tremble! O marvellous power of a preached gospel! O
          mighty truth that God is with the ministry, when the kings of the
          earth that take counsel together are yet dismayed by it. Who is he
          that doth not see here something more than human eloquence, when
          prisoner becomes the judge and the prince upon the throne becomes the
          criminal? |Felix trembled.| Have I not some here who have experienced
          the same feelings as Felix? Some plain-spoken minister has told you
          something that was rather too plain for you. At first you were angry;
          on second thoughts, and as the man moved on in his discourse, you
          became chagrined that you gave him the opportunity of thus exposing
          you, as you imagined. A better thought struck you and you saw at once
          that the man could have no intention personally to insult you; and
          then your feelings changed. Thunderbolt after thunderbolt fell from
          his lips; he seemed a very Jupiter Tonans sitting upon his throne,
          casting lightnings from his lips. Ye began to tremble. |Verily here is
          a man that has told me all things that ever I did; is not this man
          sent from Christ?| Ah! and thus you have borne your witness to the
          truth of the gospel. Though you have not felt its power to your
          salvation, yet you have been an unwilling witness that the gospel has
          been true; for you have felt its power when it made your knees knock
          together, and your eyes run down with tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is it that makes men tremble under the sound of the Gospel?
          Some say it is their conscience. Yes, and doubtless it is in some
          sense. The poet said, |Conscience makes cowards of us all;| and
          certainly, when the minister's exposition is faithful and pertinent to
          our own case, conscience, if it be not thoroughly seared and dead,
          will make the blush mantle on our cheeks. But I take it that
          conscience of itself is so thoroughly corrupt, together with all the
          other powers of manhood, that it would never even make a man go so far
          as trembling, if there were not something at work upon the conscience,
          besides being left to its own natural force. My brethren, I believe
          that what some people call natural conviction is, after all, the work
          of the Spirit. Some very profound divines are so fond of the doctrine
          that the Holy Spirit always works efficaciously, that they think that
          the Spirit never can work a transitory emotion in a man's soul; they
          impute such things to conscience. And if they see a man like Felix
          trembling, they say tis all natural conscience! Now, do they not see
          that they are in this touching on another doctrine equally dear to
          them -- the doctrine of total depravity? -- for if men be totally
          depraved by nature, then as trembling is a good thing, they are not
          capable even of that without some influence of the Holy Spirit. The
          fact is, my hearers, the Holy Spirit works in two ways. In some men's
          hearts he works with restraining Grace only, and the restraining
          Grace, though it will not save them, is enough to keep them from
          breaking out into the open and corrupt vices in which some men indulge
          who are totally left by the restraints of the Spirit. Now, there was
          in Felix some little portion of this restraining Grace; and when the
          Apostle laid the Gospel open to him, this restraining Grace quickened
          the conscience, and compelled Felix to tremble. Mark you, this Grace
          man may resist and does resist; for albeit that the Holy Spirit is
          Omnipotent and never can be resisted when he works Omnipotently, yet
          as a strong man may sometimes not put out all his strength, but work
          with his finger, for instance, so that he may permit even a gnat or an
          ant to overcome him, even so the Holy Spirit sometimes works but
          temporarily and but for good and excellent purposes, which he always
          accomplishes; but he allows men to quench and resist his influences,
          so that salvation is not so much as approached thereby. God the Holy
          Spirit may work in men some good desires and feelings, and yet have no
          design of saving them. But mark, none of these feelings are things
          that accompany sure salvation, for if so, they would be continued. But
          he does not work Omnipotently to save, except in the persons of his
          own elect, whom he assuredly bringeth to himself. I believe, then,
          that the trembling of Felix is to be accounted for by the restraining
          grace of the Spirit quickening his conscience and making him tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall be said of some of you who never tremble? Thou hast
          come hither this morning with thy brazen face, and with thine impudent
          and arrogant heart. Thou hast been mouthing high heaven with thy
          blasphemies; and now thou standest all unmoved and unabashed in the
          house of God. Though a Baxter should rise from the dead, and with
          moving sighs and tears should preach the Gospel, you would laugh and
          scoff; though Boanerges with a tongue of thunder should come and
          preach to you, you would turn up your lip and find some fault with his
          oratory, and his words would never reach your heart. O ungodly
          generation! how hath God given you up, and how hath hell bewitched
          you? O race of evil doers! children that are corrupters! how are ye
          seared. My soul reads with prophetic glance the handwriting on the
          wall! You are condemned already; you are past hope, |trees plucked up
          by the roots, twice dead.| For in the fact that ye tremble not, there
          is proof not only of your death but of your positive corruption. Ye
          shall die as ye are, without hope, without trust or refuge; for he
          that hath lost feeling hath lost hope; he that is past conscience, God
          the Holy Spirit hath given up, and he will no more strive with him for
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, passing rapidly over this point of the trembling
          audience, we come in the next place to the LAMENTABLE DISAPPPOINTMENT
          which Paul experienced, when he saw Felix rise in haste, and dismiss
          him from his presence. |It is wonderful,| said a good man once to a
          minister, |it is wonderful to see a whole congregation moved to tears
          by the preaching of the Word.| |Yes,| said that minister, |it is
          wonderful; but I know a wonder ten times greater than that: the wonder
          is, that those people should so soon wipe away their tears and forget
          what they have heard. Tis wonderful that Felix trembled before Paul;
          tis more wonderful that Felix should say, |Go thy way.| |Tis strange,
          tis passing strange,| that when the word touches the conscience, even
          then sin hath such power over men, that the truth can be repulsed and
          driven out of the heart. Felix, unhappy Felix! why is it that thou
          dost rise from thy judgment-seat? Is it that thou hast much business
          to do? Stop, Felix; let Paul speak to thee a minute longer. Thou hast
          business: but hast thou no business for thy soul? Stop, unhappy man!
          Art thou about again to be extortionate, again to make thy personal
          riches greater! Oh! stop: canst thou not spare another minute for thy
          poor soul? It is to live for ever: hast thou naught laid up for it --
          no hope in heaven, no blood of Christ, no pardon of sin, no
          sanctifying Spirit, no imputed righteousness? Ah! man there will be a
          time when the business that seems so important to thee will prove to
          have been but a day-dream, a poor substitute for the solid realities
          thou hast forgotten. Dost thou reply, |Nay, the king has sent me an
          urgent commission; I must attend to Caesar.| Ah! Felix, but thou hast
          a greater monarch than Caesar: there is one who is Emperor of heaven
          and Lord of earth; canst thou spare no time to attend to his commands?
          Before his presence Caesar is but a worm. Man! wilt thou obey the one,
          and wilt thou despise the other? Ah! no; I know what thou durst not
          say. Felix, thou art turning aside again to indulge in thy lascivious
          pleasures. Go, and Drusilla with thee! But stop! Darest thou do that,
          with that last word ringing in thy ears, |Judgment to come.| What!
          wilt thou repeat that wanton dalliance that hath damned thee already,
          and wilt thou go again to imbrue thy hands in lust, and doubly damn
          thy spirit, after warnings heard and felt? O man! I could weep o'er
          thee, to think that as the bullock goeth to the slaughter, and as the
          lamb licks the knife, so dost thou go back to the sin that destroys
          thee, and to the lust that ruins thee. You, too, many of you, have
          often been impressed under the ministry. I know what you have said on
          the Monday morning, after deep searchings of heart on the Sabbath: you
          have said, |I must attend to business, I must see after the things of
          this world.| Ah! you will say that one day, when hell shall laugh you
          in the face for your folly. Think of men that are dying every day
          saying, |We must live,| and forgetting that they must die. O poor
          soul! to be caring about that house, thy body, and neglecting the
          tenant within! Another replies, |I must have a little more pleasure.|
          Pleasure dost thou call it? What! can there be pleasure in turning
          suicide to thine own soul -- pleasure in defying thy Maker, trampling
          on his laws, despising his grace? If this be pleasure, tis a pleasure
          over which angels might weep. What, man, wilt thou count this pleasure
          when thou comest to die? Above all, wilt thou count this pleasure when
          thou dost stand before thy Maker's bar at last? It is a strange
          delusion that causes thee to believe a lie. There is no pleasure in
          that which brings wrath upon thy soul, even to the uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the usual reply is, |There is time enough yet.| The young man
          says, |Let me alone till I grow old.| And you old men, what do you
          say? I can suppose that the youth looks forward to life, and expects
          to find a future time more convenient. But there are some of you o'er
          whose heads seventy winters have blown. When do you hope to find a
          convenient season? You are within a few days' march of the tomb: if
          you do but open your poor dull eyes, you may see death but a slight
          distance in advance. The young may die; the old must! To sleep in
          youth is to sleep in a siege; to sleep in old age is to slumber during
          the attack. What! man, wilt thou that art so near thy Maker's bar
          still put him off with a |Go thy way?| What! procrastinate now, when
          the knife is at thy throat -- when the worm is at the heart of the
          tree, and the branches have begun to wither -- when the grinders fail
          even now, because they are few, and they that look out of the windows
          are darkened? The sere and yellow leaf has come upon thee, and thou
          art still unready for thy doom! O man! of all fools, a fool with a
          gray head is the worst fool anywhere. With one foot in the grave, and
          another foot on a sandy foundation, how shall I depict you, but by
          saying to you, as God said to the rich man, |Thou fool! a few more
          nights and thy soul shall be required of thee;| and then where art
          thou?
        </p>
        <p>
          But still the common cry is, |There is time enough.| Even the worldly
          moralist said, |Time enough is always little enough.| Time enough,
          man! What for? Surely you have spent time enough in sin: the time past
          may |suffice you to have wrought the will of the Gentiles.| What! time
          enough to serve a God that laid down his life for you? No! eternity
          will not be too long to utter his praise, and therefore it can not be
          too long to love him here, and serve him the few remaining days that
          you are to live on earth. But stop! I will reason with you. Come,
          Felix! thou shalt not go away this morning till my whole soul hath
          poured itself out over thee, not until I have cast mine arms round
          thee, and tried to stop thee this time from turning from the face of
          him that bids thee live. Thou sayest, |Another time.| How knowest thou
          that thou wilt ever feel again as thou feelest now? This morning,
          perhaps, a voice is saying in thine heart, |Prepare to meet thy God.|
          To-morrow that voice will be hushed. The gayeties of the ball-room and
          the theater will put out that voice that warns thee now, and perhaps
          thou wilt never hear it again. Men all have their warnings, and all
          men who perish have had a last warning. Perhaps this is your last
          warning. You are told to-day, that except ye repent, ye must perish,
          except ye put your trust in Christ, ye must be cast away forever.
          Perhaps no honest lip will again warn you; perhaps no tearful eye will
          ever look on you affectionately again; God to-day is pulling the reins
          tight to check you from your lust; perhaps, if to-day you spurn the
          bit, and rush madly on, he will throw the reins upon your back,
          saying, |Let him alone;| and then it is a dark steeplechase between
          earth and hell, and you will run it in mad confusion, never thinking
          of a hell till you find yourself past warning, past repentance, past
          faith, past hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: how knowest thou, if thou shouldst ever have these feelings
          again, God will accept thee then? |To-day,| he says, |to-day, if ye
          will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.| This hour his love
          weepeth over you, and his bowels yearn for you. To-day he says, |Come,
          let us reason together; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
          as wool; and though they be red like crimson, they shall be whiter
          than snow.| Do you to-day turn a deaf ear to trim? Do you to-day
          forego his invitation and despise his warning? Take heed! You may one
          day need what now you despise, and you may then cry to him, but he
          will not hear you; you may then pray to him, but he will shut out your
          prayer, and his only answer will be, |I called!| |I called, and you
          refused. You stood against that pillar under the gallery; I called and
          you refused! I stretched out my hands, as if I would bring you to my
          bosom, and no man regarded me. You were there in the gallery; you
          listened, but it was as though you heard not; therefore| -- and oh!
          the dreadful conclusion! -- |I also will laugh at your calamity, I
          will mock when your fear cometh.| Stay! those are not my words, they
          are God's words. Turn ye to the book of Proverbs, and find them there.
          It were a harsh thing for me to say of God; but God says it of
          himself, and God is true, though every man be a liar; and if he be
          true, how know ye that he may not despise your prayer one day, shut
          out your cry, and banish you forever?
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: how do you know that you shall live to be warned again?
          Said a minister once, when I gently hinted to him that he had not
          preached the gospel that morning, |No, I did not mean to preach to
          sinners in the morning; but I will preach to them in the evening.|
          |Ah!| said I, |but what if some of your congregation of the morning
          should be in hell before the evening.| So may I say to you. You have
          promised to go to a friend's house to-day, you think you can not break
          that promise; you wish you could. You wish you could go home and fall
          on your knees and pray; but no, you can not, because your promise
          binds you. You will have a convenient season one of these days! And so
          God Almighty is to wait man's convenience! How do you know you will
          live till that convenience comes? A little too much heat or too much
          cold within the brain -- a little too fast flowing of the blood, or a
          little too slow circulation thereof -- some little turning of the
          fluids of the body in a wrong direction, and you are dead!
        </p>
        <p>|Dangers stand thick through all the ground,</p>
        <p>To bear you to the tomb,</p>
        <p>And fierce diseases wait around,</p>
        <p>To hurry mortals home.|</p>
        <p>
          Oh! why will you then dare to procrastinate, and say, |time enough
          yet?| Will your soul ever be saved by your saying |Time enough yet?|
          Archbishop Tillotson well says, |A man might say I resolve to eat, but
          the resolve to eat would never feed his body. A man might say, I am
          resolved to drink, but the resolve to drink would never slake his
          thirst.| And you may say, |I am resolved by-and-by to seek God;| but
          your resolve will not save you. It is not the forgetful hearer but the
          doer of the word that shall be blessed therein. Oh that ye might now
          say -- To-day, my God, to-day I confess my sin; to-day I ask thee to
          manifest thy grace; to-day receive my guilty soul, and show me a
          Saviours blood; to-day I renounce my follies, my vices, and my sins,
          constrained by Sovereign Grace; to-day I cast away my good works as my
          ground of trust; to-day I cry,
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling!|</p>
        <p>
          Oh! happy minister who shall have such an audience! -- happier than
          Paul, if he should know that his congregation had said this! Come, O
          Holy Spirit, and draw unwilling hearts, and make them bow before the
          scepter of sovereign grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preaching, you see, takes away my voice. Ah! it is not that. It is not
          the preaching, but the sighing over your souls that is the hard work.
          I could preach forever: I could stand here day and night to tell my
          Master's love, and warn poor souls; but tis the after-thought that
          will follow me when I descend these pulpit steps, that many of you, my
          hearers, will neglect this warning. You will go; you will walk into
          the street; you will joke; you will laugh. My Master says, |Son of
          man, hast thou heard what the children of Israel say concerning thee?
          Behold, thou art as one that playeth a tune upon an instrument; they
          make merry with thee, and they go their ways.| Yes, but that were
          little. To be laughed at is no great hardship to me. I can delight in
          scoffs and jeers; caricatures, lampoons, and slanders, are my glory;
          of these things I boast, yea, in these I will rejoice. But that you
          should turn from your own mercy, this is my sorrow. Spit on me, but
          oh! repent! Laugh at me: but oh I believe in my Master! Make my body
          as the dirt of the streets, if you will: but damn not your own souls!
          Oh! do not despise your own mercies. Put not away from you the gospel
          of Christ. There are many other ways of playing fool beside that.
          Carry coals in your bosom: knock your head against a wall: but do not
          damn your souls for the mere sake of being a fool, for fools laugh at.
          Oh! be in earned upon an earnest subject. If there be no hereafter,
          live as you like; if there be no heaven, if there be no hell, laugh at
          me! But if these things be true, and you believe them, I charge you,
          as I shall face you at the judgment bar of the Lord Jesus in the day
          of judgment -- I charge you, by your own immortal welfare, lay these
          things to heart. Prepare to meet your God, O sons of Israel! And the
          Lord help you in this thing; for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
