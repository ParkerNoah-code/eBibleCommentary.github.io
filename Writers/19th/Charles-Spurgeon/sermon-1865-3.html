        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.641)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 23rd, 1865, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
          said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou
          forgavest the iniquity of my sin.| -- Psalm 32:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          DAVID'S grief for sin was long and terrible. Its effects were visible
          upon his outward frame; |his bones waxed old;| |his moisture was
          turned into the drought of summer.| No remedy could he find, until he
          made a full confession before the throne of the heavenly grace. He
          tells us, that for a time he kept silence, and then his heart became
          more and more filled with grief: like some mountain tarn whose outlet
          is blocked up, his soul was swollen with torrents of sorrow. He
          dreaded to confront his sin. He fashioned excuses; he endeavoured to
          divert his thoughts, by giving his mind to the cares of his kingdom or
          the pleasures of his court, but it was all to no purpose; the rankling
          arrow made the wound bleed anew, and made the gash more wide and deep
          every day. Like a festering sore his anguish gathered and increased,
          and as he would not use the lancet of confession, his spirits became
          more and more full of torment, and there was no rest in his bones
          because of sin. At last it came to this, that he must return unto his
          God in humble penitence, or he must die outright; so he hastened to
          the mercy-seat, and there unrolled the volume of his iniquities before
          the eye of the all-seeing One, acknowledging all the evil of his ways
          in language such as you read in the fifty-first and other penitential
          Psalms. Having done this, a work so simple and yet so difficult to
          pride, he received at once the token of divine forgiveness; the bones
          which had been broken were made to rejoice, and he came forth from his
          closet to sing the blessedness of the man whose transgression is
          forgiven, and whose sin is covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, dear friends, the value of a truthful grace-wrought confession of
          sin; it is to be prized above all price, for he that confesseth his
          sin and forsaketh it, shall find mercy. Now, it is a well known fact,
          that when God is pleased to bestow upon men any choice gift, Satan,
          who is the god of counterfeits, is sure very soon to produce a base
          imitation, true in appearance, but worthless in reality: his object is
          deception, and full often he succeeds. How many there are who have
          made a worthless confession, and yet are relying upon it as though it
          were a work of grace; they have come before God as a matter of form,
          and have said, |Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners;| and
          having so done, imagine that they have received the divine absolution,
          when alas! alas! it is easy to be deceived, and difficult to cultivate
          within one's heart that genuine repentance, which is the work of God
          the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          May God grant us his gracious assistance while we describe two widely
          different sorts of confession which have been very vividly brought
          before us during the past week; and then we will have a few words upon
          the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy which is vested in God,
          who gives forgiveness to those whose confession is sincere.
        </p>
        <p>I. Let me set before you TWO SORTS OF CONFESSION.</p>
        <p>
          At this present moment, unhappily, two persons are lying under
          sentence of death, for murders of the most atrocious character.
          Without wishing to say a single word with regard to the state of soul
          of either of these persons -- for into that it is no business of mine
          to pry -- it seems to me that the published reports of their cases,
          may very properly furnish us with types of two sorts of persons. It is
          remarkable that two such cases as those of Dr. Pritchard and Constance
          Kent should be before the public eye at the same moment and that the
          points of contrast in their confession should be so exceedingly clear.
          I cannot but hope and pray that we may gather some few lessons of
          warning from crimes which have no doubt exercised a great influence
          for evil upon the masses of our country.
        </p>
        <p>
          The confession which has been made by Dr. PRITCHARD, maybe taken as a
          specimen of those which are full often made by impenitent sinners,
          which can never be regarded as acceptable before the throne of the
          Most High. Here is a man who is accused of the atrocious crime of
          murdering his wife and his mother-in-law, and when he answers to the
          indictment, we are not astonished to hear him plead, |Not Guilty!| I
          am far from being severe upon him for so pleading, but viewing him as
          a type, I would remind you that thousands of those who call themselves
          |miserable sinners| in our public services, if they were called to
          plead before the bar of God, would have the effrontery to say |Not
          Guilty.| They might not use the words, very probably they would use
          terms having the opposite meaning, but their heart-plea would be, |not
          guilty.| If they had the law of God explained to them and they were
          questioned upon each commandment, |Have you broken this? Have you
          broken that?| though ready enough to confess in the gross that they
          have sinned, when it came to details they would be for denying all. We
          have heard of a woman who readily allowed that she was a sinner |O
          yes, sir, we are all sinners. Just so, sir.| But when the visitor sat
          down and opened the book, and pointing to the commandment, said, |Have
          you ever had any other God save the Lord?| She did not know that she
          ever had. |Had she ever taken God's name in vain?| |O dear no, sir, I
          never did anything so wicked.| Each precept was explained, and she
          very positively claimed that she had not broken it. She had not
          violated the Sabbath; she had not killed anybody; she had not
          committed adultery; she had not borne false witness, or coveted
          anything; she was altogether, in detail, innocent, though in the gross
          she was quite willing to say as other people, |Oh, yes! I am a sinner,
          of course, sir, we are all sinners!| which, being interpreted, means,
          |I am ready to say anything you like to put into my mouth, but I do
          not believe a syllable of it.| The inward speech of the unconverted
          man is, |I am not guilty.| Ask the unhumbled transgressor, |Art thou
          worthy of God's wrath?| and his proud heart replies, |I am not.| |Art
          thou worthy to be cast away for ever from God's presence on account of
          sin?| and the unbroken, uncontrite soul replies. |I am not. I am no
          thief, nor adulterer, nor extortioner; I have not sinned as yon
          publican has done. I thank God that I am not as other men are.| Man
          pleads Not Guilty, and yet all the while within his heart, so proud
          and boastful, there may readily be discerned abundant evidence of
          abounding sin. The leprosy is white upon his unclean brow, and yet the
          man claims to be sound and whole. If there were no other evidence
          against us, the very pride which boasts of innocence would be
          sufficient to convict us of sin, and will be so when we are taught
          right reason by the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guilty man whose case we are now looking upon as an illustration,
          endeavoured, as a means of defense for himself, to involve another in
          the dreadful guilt and punishment of his atrocious sin. There were
          very distinct signs that he would have been perfectly satisfied if the
          woman who had ministered to his sinful pleasures had been accused and
          condemned of the crime of which he alone was guilty. Certainly this is
          the case with the great mass of those who are compelled to acknowledge
          their sins. Our first parent could not deny that he had taken of the
          forbidden fruit, but he laid the blame upon Eve: |The woman whom thou
          gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat.| Ah Adam!
          where is thy manliness, where thy love to thy spouse, that thou
          wouldest involve in the ruin her who was bone of thy bone so as to
          escape thyself? And she! she will not take the blame for a moment, but
          it is the serpent; she casts all the sin on him. In this first case of
          sin, the attempt was less atrocious than in that of the prisoner
          before us, because there was real guilt both in the woman and in the
          serpent, while it does not appear that the servant girl in Pritchard's
          family had any share in the poisoning. However, the human heart is
          such, that if we could really throw all the shame and blame of sin
          upon another who was perfectly innocent, there would be a strong
          temptation to do so if we might by such means be considered innocent.
          Nay, let me show that Adam virtually did that, for he said |The woman
          whom thou gavest me,| thus virtually laying the blame of his
          rebellious deed upon God himself. And God, what hand had he in Adam's
          eating of the fruit of the accursed tree? It was an act of Adam's free
          will, he did as he pleased concerning it, and the most holy God could
          in no sense be made partaker of his transgression. Yet, think of it!
          He would sooner that the great God, who is hymned of angels as the
          thrice Holy One, should bear the fault of his iniquity than he would
          bear it himself. Such are we naturally. We may bend the knee and say
          we are miserable sinners, but unless the grace of God has taught us to
          make true confession we are always for shifting the burden to some
          other shoulder, and making it out that after all, though nominally
          miserable sinners, we are not so bad as a great many other people, and
          have a deal saddled upon us which really is no fault of ours, but
          belongs to providence, to fate, to our fellow men, to the devil, to
          the weather, and I know not what besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convicted criminal who stands before us in our picture made no
          confession whatever until the case was proved and sentence pronounced.
          The case was clear enough, but he did his best to make it difficult;
          had he been completely free from the crime, his bearing and tone could
          have been scarcely more confident when asserting his innocence. I
          admit that it was very natural that he should not aid to convict
          himself, it is because it is so natural that the man serves so
          admirably as a representative of human nature when it makes its
          impenitent confessions. When it could not avail the wretch to withhold
          the truth, when facts were brought out so clear, when the jury had
          decided, when the judge had pronounced sentence, then, and not till
          then, he yielded to tears and entreaties, and proffered a confession,
          such as it was. So is it ever with unregenerate humanity; though
          cognizant of sin, we only acknowledge before the Lord that which is
          too glaring to be denied. Sin may be held up before the eyes of the
          man who is guilty of it, and often he will disown his own offspring,
          or assert that it is not what God's Word declares it to be. Holy
          Scripture accuses us of a thousand sins which we practically claim to
          be innocent of, for we flatter ourselves that the Bible puts too harsh
          a construction upon our actions, and that we are not what it declares
          us to be. When our fellow-men concur in censuring our fault we are
          compelled to blush, but of what value is a repentance which owes its
          existence to the overwhelming testimony of our fellow offenders
          against us. This force-work is far removed from the free and ready
          acknowledgments of a man whose heart is touched by divine grace and
          melted by the love of Jesus. When men are upon their dying beds, when
          the ghosts of their iniquities haunt them, when the red hand of guilt
          draws the curtain, when they can almost hear the sentence of the last
          judgment, then they will make a confession, but may we not fear that
          it is of little value, since it is wrung and extorted from them by
          fear of hell and horror of the wrath to come. True repentance wrought
          in us by the Holy Ghost drops as freely as honey droppeth from the
          comb, but merely natural confessions are like the worst of the wine
          squeezed by main force from the dregs. O dear friends, God deliver you
          from ungracious confessions of sin, and enable you sincerely to repent
          at the foot of Jesus' cross!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the confession came, in the case before us, it was very partial.
          He had killed one, but he professed himself guiltless of the other's
          death. Villain as he was, on his own shewing, he could go the length
          of owning half his crime, but then he started back and acted the liar.
          No, she died by accident, and he, to avoid being charged unjustly --
          innocent creature as he was -- had put the poison in the bottle
          afterwards. He had the wickedness to feign a wonder that his tale was
          not believed, and likened those who doubted him to those who would not
          believe the Lord of glory. Now, the confessions of unregenerate men
          are precisely of this sort. They will go the length of owning, if they
          have been drinking, or if they have broken the laws of the state,
          |yes, we have offended here,| but the great mass of sins against God
          are not confessed, nor allowed to be sins at all. Men will often lay a
          stress upon sins of which they are not conspicuously guilty, and omit
          those which are the most glaring. What unrenewed man thinks it a sin
          to forget God, to forsake the Creator's fountain of living waters for
          the cisterns of the creature, or to live without God in the world? And
          yet, these are the most crying of all iniquities. To rob God of his
          glory, to despise his Son, to disbelieve the gospel, to live for self,
          to be self-righteous -- all these are heinous evils, but what carnal
          man owns to them as such? Covetousness! again, who ever confesses
          that? Thousands are guilty of it, but few will own it even in private
          before the Lord. No confession will be acceptable before God, unless
          you are willing to make a clean breast of the whole of your evil ways,
          words and thoughts, before the searcher of hearts. I do not wonder if
          you should fail to tell to others your offenses; it were not meet you
          should do so except wherein you have offended them and may make
          retribution by the confession; but before God you must open all, you
          must roll away the stone from the mouth of that sepulcher, even though
          your iniquity, like Lazarus, should stink. There must be no mincing
          the matter, things must be called by their right names; you must be
          willing to feel the horrible sinfulness of sin, and as far as you can,
          you must descend to the very bottom of its terrible guiltiness, and
          acknowledge its blackness, its heinousness, its devilry, its
          abomination. No confession will be acceptable before God, if you
          knowingly and wilfully gloss over any sin; if you make any exception,
          or are partial with respect to any form of iniquity. That confession
          which hides some sins and only confesses certain others stops one leak
          in the soul and opens another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor ought it to be forgotten, that when the criminal had confessed his
          sin, yet still in the last confession -- which we may suppose to have
          been true, there are words of extenuation, and nothing to indicate any
          deep and suitable sensibility of his great enormity. He hints at
          reasons why he was scarcely accountable -- a sort of madness and the
          influence of strong drink must be execrated for the crime, and not the
          man himself. O God, thou knowest how often in our natural confessions,
          before thy grace met with us, we made wretched and mean excuses for
          ourselves! We said that a strong temptation overcame us; it was an
          unguarded moment; it was our constitution and our besetting sins; it
          was our friend who led us astray; it was God's providence which tried
          us; it was anything rather than ourselves -- we were to blame, no
          doubt, but still there were extenuating circumstances. Beloved
          friends! a man can never make a true confession till he feels that sin
          is his own sin, and is willing to confess it as such; he must cease to
          apologize any longer, and must just stand forth before the Lord, and
          cry, |I have sinned, willfully and infamously, and here, standing in
          thy presence, I acknowledge it: but if a word of apology could save my
          soul, I dare not utter it, for I should again be guilty of a lie.| May
          this teach us to seek out rather the aggravations of our sin than
          fancied extenuations of it. Try to see the worst of thy case, sinner,
          more than to gloss it or gild it over and make it seem better than it
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this, remember, was committed by this miserable murderer, who is
          so soon to appear before his God, not through ignorance, but in spite
          of a clear consciousness of the wrong of his deed. Had he been some
          person of a low mental organization, or of neglected intellect, there
          might be some plea. If, for instance, he had never been able to read,
          and had received his only education amid thieves and vagabonds, there
          might have been some excuse, and we might have said, |It is the sin of
          the community which fails to provide moral and religions instruction
          for the people;| but here is a man who knows better, who, I suppose,
          had listened to thousands of sermons, had a knowledge of the Bible,
          had pretended to pray, was well taught as to the matter of right and
          wrong, and yet still, in defiance of all this, he sins, and to make
          the matter worse, shows no signs of softening of heart, no tenderness,
          no melting, nothing of deep regret, and shame, and contrition, and
          humbleness of heart, but is, apparently (I say no more) as obdurate in
          confessing his guilt as when he was denying it. Ah! but there are too
          many who make confession, having no broken hearts, no streaming eyes,
          no flowing tears, no humbled spirits. Know ye this, that ten thousand
          confessions, if they are made by hardened hearts, if they do not
          spring from really contrite spirits shall be only additions to your
          guilt as they are mockeries before the Most High. Let these suffice as
          remarks upon unacceptable confession. Oh Lord, let thy Holy Spirit
          give to the guilty one, of whom we have been speaking, and to us all
          that broken and contrite heart, which thou wilt accept through Jesus
          Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          The second case must now come before us, and here again I do not
          desire to speak anything about the state of heart of CONSTANCE KENT, I
          only speak of her outward act, and only of that as a symbol of true
          confession. Here is one avowedly guilty of a most atrocious murder, a
          very great and terrible crime; but when she appears in court she is
          brought there upon her own confession; her life was in no danger from
          the witness of other people. She surrendered herself voluntarily, and
          when she stood before the judge, she pleaded guilty. No doubt her
          anxious friends had suggested to her the desirableness of pleading
          |Not guilty,| hoping to save her life by failure in the evidence, or
          plea of insanity, or some other legal method of saving criminals from
          the gallows. Mark, however, how distinctly she says |Guilty;| and
          though the question is repeated and space is given her to retract, her
          reply is still the one self-condemning word |GUILTY!| Even so before
          the Lord, whenever we come to confess we must approach him with this
          cry, Guilty, Guilty! |Lord, I cannot say anything else. If hell be my
          eternal portion for it, I dare say no other. The stones in the streets
          would cry out against me if I denied my guilt. When my memory shows me
          the record of my days, its truthful witness is that I have broken thy
          law; and when my conscience looks at the way in which I have
          transgressed, it cannot say anything but this, Thou hast wilfully
          broken God's law and thou deservest his wrath.'| Now sinner, thou
          shalt never be at peace with God until thou art willing unreservedly
          to plead |Guilty.| That self-righteous spirit of thine must be cast
          out as though it were the very devil, for it is next akin to the
          devil, and is quite as mischievous, and thou must be brought down
          humbly to lie at the foot of Jehovah's throne and confess that thou
          dost richly deserve his wrath, for thou hast defied his righteous law
          and sinned against him with a high hand. You must plead |Guilty,| or
          remain guilty for ever. You shall never find pardon through Jesus
          Christ till you are willing, truly and really, to own yourself a
          sinner.

          Constance Kent was anxious to free all others from the blame of her
          sin. Her counsel says, in open court, |Solemnly, in the presence of
          Almighty God, as a person who values her own soul, she wishes me to
          say that the guilt is her own alone; and that her father and others,
          who have so long suffered most unjust and cruel suspicions, are wholly
          and absolutely innocent.| This is well spoken. I know nothing of this
          young woman's heart, but using her as an illustration rather than an
          example, we are safe in saying that it is a very blessed sign of true
          repentance when the sinner cries out with David, |I acknowledge my
          transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only,
          have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.| There will be in a
          gracious penitent no attempt to lay the blame upon the tempter, or
          upon providence; no dwelling upon circumstances, the suddenness of the
          temptation, or the hastiness of one's temper. |Oh God,| says the
          sinner, | I have sinned myself; I have nothing in the world that is so
          truly my own as my own sin. For this my sin, I alone am accountable,
          and I feel it, and I cannot, I dare not impeach any one else with
          being guilty of my sin. I must stand in my own person before thee, O
          God, even if that involves my eternal ruin.| It will never do for you
          to lay the blame on your mothers and fathers because they did not
          teach you better, upon the minister for not being earnest enough, or
          upon your master for telling you to do wrong. It is true that we may
          be partakers of your sins in a measure, but if you be sincerely
          penitent, the guilt which will strike you will not be another man's
          guilt, nor another man's share in your sin, but your own guilt. A
          sinner has not been brought truly before the Lord in humble
          contrition, unless his cry is |Lord! I have sinned, I have sinned so
          as to be guilty myself, in my own person. Have mercy upon me!|
        </p>

          The unhappy young woman now condemned to die needed no witness to come
          forward to prove her guilt and ensure her conviction. No one saw the
          deed; it was done so secretly that the most expert detectives were not
          able to find a satisfactory clue to the mystery. There may be
          collateral evidence to support her confession; it may, or it may not
          be true that her conviction would now have been certain had her
          confession been retracted; but she did not need that, for without any
          voice of man to witness she witnessed against herself. It will never
          suffice for us merely to confess to the Lord what other people have
          seen, and to feel guilty because we know that the case is reported in
          the neighborhood. Many people who have fallen into sin, have felt very
          penitent because they knew they should damage their names, or lose
          their situations; but to have your private sin brought before you by
          conscience, and voluntarily without any pressure but the burden of sin
          itself and the work of the Holy Spirit, to come before God and say,
          |Lord, thou knowest in this matter I have offended, and though none
          saw me except thine eye and mine; yet thine eye might well flash with
          anger at me, while mine shall be wet with many a tear of penitence on
          account of it:| that is what you need, Sinner, thou must come before
          God now and let out thine heart without any external pressure.
          Spontaneously must thy soul flow out, poured out like water before the
          Lord, or thou must not hope that he will give thee pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          She confessed all. It was a solemn moment when the judge said, |I must
          repeat to you, that you are charged with having wilfully,
          intentionally, and with malice killed and murdered your brother. Are
          you guilty or not guilty?| Yes, she was guilty, just as the judge had
          put it. She did not object to those words which made the case come out
          so black. The willfulness? -- yes, she acknowledged that. The
          intention, the malice? -- yes, all that. The killing, the murdering --
          was it just murder? -- was it nothing less? No, nothing else. Not a
          word of extenuation. She acknowledges all, just as the judge puts it.
          She is guilty in very deed of the whole charge. Sinner, will you
          confess sin as God puts it? Many will confess sin after their own
          fashion, but will you confess it as God puts it? Are you brought to
          see sin as God sees it? as far as mortal eye could bear that dreadful
          sight, and do you confess now just what God lays to your door, that
          you have been his enemy, a traitor, full of evil, covered with
          iniquity? Will you confess that you have crucified his dear Son, and
          have in all ways deserved his hottest wrath and displeasure -- will
          you plead guilty to that? If not, you shall have no pardon; but if you
          will do this, he is merciful and just to forgive you your sins through
          Jesus the great atoning sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had not, nor had her counsel for her, a single word to say by way
          of apology; in fact, at her request, one supposed excuse was utterly
          discarded: |She wishes me to say that she was not driven to this act,
          as has been asserted, by unkind treatment at home, as she met with
          nothing there but tender and forbearing hove.| Her counsel might have
          said she was very young -- it was hoped that her youth might plead for
          her. Being young, she might be readily led astray by an evil passion
          -- might not that excuse her? It was long ago, and her confession was
          her own; she had brought herself there into that dock -- might not
          this be a reason for mercy? Nothing of the kind. The judge might think
          so if he pleased, but there was nothing said for her about that, nor
          did she desire that it should be suggested. She might secretly hope,
          but her confession was so thorough, that there was not a single word
          to sully its clear stream. So, sinner, if you come before God, you
          must not say, |Lord, I am to be excused because of my position -- I
          was in poverty, and I was tempted to steal; or, I had been in bad
          company, and so I learned to blaspheme; or, I had a hard master, and
          so I was driven to sin to find some pleasure there.| No; if you are
          really penitent, you will find no reason whatever why you should have
          sinned, except the evil of your own heart, and that you will plead as
          an aggravation, not as an excuse. |Guilty! guilty! guilty! am I, O
          God, before thy face; I offer no excuse, no extenuation. Thou must
          deal with me upon pure mercy, if thou dost save me, for justice can
          only award me my well-deserved doom.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that when she was asked whether she had anything to say why
          sentence of death should not be passed upon her, there was still a
          solemn silence. Was there no reason to be given why the dreadful
          sentence of being hanged by the neck until dead, should not be passed
          upon a young and weeping girl? She did not so much as hint at one. I
          remember well the time when I thought there was no reason why the
          flames of hell should not consume me, and why the crushing weight of
          God's wrath should not roll over me for ever and for ever. Methinks
          every sinner who has really come to Christ, has been made to feel that
          however angry God may be with sin, he is not one whit too angry. Until
          we know the power of divine grace, we read in the Bible concerning
          eternal punishment, and we think it is too heavy and too hard, and we
          are apt to kick against it, and find out some heretic or other who
          teaches us another doctrine; but when the soul is really quickened by
          divine grace, and made to feel the weight of sin, it thinks the
          bottomless pit none too deep, and the punishment of hell none too
          severe for sin such as it has committed. This is not the emotion of a
          mind rendered morbid by sickness, but these are the genuine workings
          of God the Holy Ghost in the soul, bringing the man to stand guilty
          before the Lord, with his mouth closed, not able to say a word against
          the sentence of divine justice. May God bring such there who have
          never been there yet!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the confession, as we read the story, there was much tenderness. I
          do not wonder that the judge exhibited deep emotion, who could help
          it? Remember, I am not pretending to know her heart, I am only judging
          the externals; as far as the externals went there seemed to be a great
          brokenness of spirit. She appeared really to know what guilt meant,
          and to stand there with this resolve upon her soul, that though she
          could not make any atonement for her crime, she would acknowledge it
          honestly, and accordingly she confessed it as one who felt within her
          own soul the terrible weight of her guilt. This is the manner in which
          we must stand before God if we would find mercy. It is all very well
          for us to use fine language, but words alone are worthless. Those
          words which come fresh from your lips, dictated by your own heart,
          because the Holy Ghost is there, will suffice if the heart be in them.
          It is to the contrite that the promise is given. Look to Jesus for
          contrition, for without it there is no pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus we have tried, as far as we could, to bring out the
          distinctions which pertain to confessions, and now let us have a word
          or two upon THE EXERCISE OF THE PREROGATIVE OF MERCY ON GOD'S PART.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.| In every case where there is
          a genuine, gracious confession, mercy is freely given. There is a
          notion abroad, that confession deserves mercy. We read in the papers
          such remarks as these, |expiating sin by confession,| or, |made such
          atonement as he could by confessing his sin.| Confession makes no
          atonement in any shape whatever. There is no one single word in that
          law which I read to you this morning, in the twentieth of Exodus,
          about the possibility of taking away sin by mere confession. Justice
          has but one rule, and that is, sin must be punished. If the sinner
          violates law, law in the case of man may remit the penalty, but in the
          case of God never. The attributes of God are not like the qualities of
          man, they never come into collision with one another, nor do they
          abridge the sphere of each other. The justice of God is as awful and
          all-reaching as if he had not a grain of mercy, while the mercy of God
          is as unrestrained and Almighty as if he were utterly unjust. The
          reason why sin can be forgiven in the case of a penitent sinner is,
          because for that sinner Jesus Christ has borne the full weight of all
          the wrath which his sin deserves. The fire-cloud of Jehovah's wrath
          was waiting for the sinner -- the sinner must receive the whole of its
          dread discharge; but for every sinner that repenteth and believeth in
          him Christ stood beneath that terrible cloud, and all the lightning
          was discharged on him. He suffered as incarnate God, all the
          chastisement which was due to his people. The grief of our Saviour we
          can never tell: the woes of Gethsemane and Gabbatha and Golgotha are
          not to be expressed, but they were accepted by God in the stead of all
          the suffering and grief which the law most righteously claimed on
          every law-breaker. And now, through what Christ Jesus has done, the
          eternal mercy of God comes streaming forth in perfect consistency with
          justice. Mercy provided the great substitute, and now mercy with
          loving heart calls upon sinners repenting and believing, and assures
          them that all sin is put away through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
          Let every sinner know, then, that although his repentance does not
          deserve mercy, the God of love has been pleased to promise free pardon
          to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, because Christ
          deserves it. Pardon is given to penitent sinners as a matter of
          justice, as well as mercy, because of the throes, and grief, and
          agonies of the Divine Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          How consistent it is with the nature of things that penitent sinners,
          and penitent sinners only should obtain mercy through Jesus Christ!
          When you read the story of the man who made no confession till it was
          forced out of him, although you can respond to his wish, |Fellow
          creatures, pray for me,| you cannot feel much sympathy, if any, with
          him. His conduct seems to harden one's heart against him, not merely
          because of his guilt, but because of the lie of his confession, But,
          when you read the other story, although it contains no request to
          pray, you find you do not want one for your heart cries at once,
          |Father forgive her;| and you think within yourself, |If the
          prerogative of mercy can be exercised in this case, let it be.| If it
          were put to a show of hands of all our country whether the law should
          be executed on Constance Kent, I think we should all say |Let the
          penitent sinner live.| Great was her offense, and no excuse is to be
          offered for her, as she offers none for herself. It was a great and
          dreadful crime, which must be a blight upon her all her days, yet, let
          her be spared for she has confessed most fully -- not on the ground of
          justice, but on the ground that this seems to be a case in which, if
          the prerogative of mercy is to be sovereignly exercised at all, it
          should now have free scope. Methinks when the eternal God sees a poor
          sinner standing before himself, and hears him cry, |I am guilty, Lord!
          I am guilty through and through! I alone am guilty! I have broken thy
          law! If thou smite me thou art just! My heart is broken because I have
          sinned. I cannot be more wretched than I now am, for sin is my plague
          and my misery; and while I confess it I do not think that my
          confession has any merit in it. Save me for Jesus' sake!| |Why,
          methinks,| the mighty God says, |I have brought that soul, through my
          grace, into a state in which it is ready to receive the precious gift
          of justification and pardon through the blood of my dear Son.|
        </p>
        <p>
          See how one grace gives a fitness for another. The sinner is brought
          to Jesus, his heart is broken, and then it is ready to be bound up.
          The penitent sinner has paid honour to the prerogative of the
          law-giver. He has, as far as he could do so, dethroned the law-giver
          by his sin, but now by his confession he restores him to his throne.
          Such a sinner knows the bitterness of sin, and knowing its bitterness,
          he will hate it for the future. If he be pardoned, he will not go back
          as the dog to his vomit, or the sow that is washed to her wallowing in
          the mire. This pardoned sinner will not take to himself the credit of
          having been pardon by his confessions, he will not go abroad and talk
          lightly of his sin, he will be sure to speak much of the leniency of
          the Law-giver and the power of Jesus' precious blood; he will admire
          evermore, even in eternity, the mighty grace which pardoned such as he
          is. On the other hand, if man were forgiven, and no true penitence
          wrought in him, what would be the result? Why, it would be turning
          wolves loose upon society. Methinks if God gave forgiveness to men
          without working a work of grace in them by which they are brought to
          repentance, it would be offering a premium for sin, it would be
          breaking down the floodgates which restrain vice, it would be
          destroying all the excellent fruits which free grace is intended to
          produce. What! is the man to be pardoned for all the past and to
          remain without repentance for his evil ways? Then will he make the
          future just as the past has been; nay, he will sin with a higher hand
          and with a stronger arm, because he sees with what impunity he may
          rebel. What! shall a proud, unhumbled sinner rejoice in the forgiving
          love of the Father? Then will he arrogantly boast that there was not
          much evil in his sin after all; he will be no singer to the praise of
          sovereign grace, but rather, with the boastful lips of the legalist he
          will render unto himself praise for the dexterous manner in which he
          has escaped from the condemnation due to sin. God will give pardon to
          those only to whom he gives repentance, for it were unsafe to give it
          elsewhere. God bring us down and lay us in the dust, for then, and
          then only, are we prepared to hear him say, |Thy sins, which are many,
          are forgiven thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I take it for granted that there are some here who will say, |I wish I
          could repent. I know that it would not merit eternal life. I
          understand that faith -- faith in Jesus Christ is the way by which I
          must be saved, but I would be humbled on account of sin.| My dear
          friend, your desire to be humble may perhaps he an indication that you
          are already in that condition; but, if you are lamenting your hardness
          of heart, I will suggest two or three things. Remember your past sins.
          I do not want you to write out a list of them all, there is not paper
          enough in this world for that, but let some of them start out before
          your memory, and if they do not make you blush, they might to do so.
          Next think over all the aggravations of those sins. Recollect the
          training you had as a child. You were blessed with godly parents.
          Remember the providential warnings you received. Think of the light
          and knowledge against which you have offended; that tenderness of
          conscience against which you kicked. Then I beg you to consider
          against what a God you have offended, so great, so good, so kind, who
          has never done you a displeasure, but has been all generosity and
          kindness to you till this day. Your offenses have been insults against
          the King of heaven. Your transgressions have been undermining, as far
          as they could, the throne of the eternal majesty. Look at sin in the
          light of God, to be humbled. And if this will not do it, let me pray
          that God the Holy Spirit may take you to the foot of the cross.
          Remember, that in order that sin might be put away, it was necessary
          that God should be veiled in human flesh. No one else could bear the
          load of sin but God, and he only could bear it by becoming man. See
          the suffering of the Saviour when |despised and rejected.| Mark the
          spitting, the shame, the smiting. Watch his wounds;
        </p>
        <p>|Count the purple drops, and say,</p>
        <p>'Thus must sin be wash'd away.'|</p>
        <p>
          And surely, if God the Holy Ghost bless it, such a meditation will
          make thee see the blackness and vileness of sin. John Bradford said,
          that when he was in prayer, he never liked to rise from his knees till
          he began to feel something of brokenness of heart. Get thee up to thy
          chamber, then, poor sinner, if thou wouldst have a broken and contrite
          spirit, and come not out until thou hast it. Remember, that thou wilt
          never feel so broken in heart as when thou canst see Jesus bearing all
          thy sins. Faith and repentance are born together, and aid the health
          of each other.
        </p>
        <p>|Law and terrors do but harden,</p>
        <p>All the while they work alone;</p>
        <p>But a sense of blood-bought pardon,</p>
        <p>Will dissolve a heart of stone.|</p>
        <p>
          Go as you are to Christ, and ask him to give that tenderness of heart
          which shall be to you the indication that pardon has come; for pardon
          cannot and will not come unattended by a melting of soul and a hatred
          of sin. Wrestle with the Lord! say, |I will not let thee go except
          thou bless me.| Get a fast hold upon the Saviour by a vigorous faith
          in his great atonement. Oh! may his Spirit enable thee to do this! Say
          in thy soul, | Here I will abide, at the horns of the altar; if I
          perish I will perish at the foot of the cross. From my hope in Jesus I
          will not depart; but I will look up still and say, Saviour, thy heart
          was broken for me, break my heart! Thou wast wounded, wound me! Thy
          blood was freely poured forth, for me, Lord let me pour forth my tears
          that I should have nailed thee to the tree. O Lord, dissolve my soul;
          melt it in tenderness, and thou shalt be for ever praised for making
          thine enemy thy friend.|
        </p>
        <p>
          May God bless you, and make you truly repent, if you have not
          repented; and, if you have, may he enable you to continue in it all
          your days, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.
