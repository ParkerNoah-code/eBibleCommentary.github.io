          |To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison,
          and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.|-Isaiah 42:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          ON A FORMER occasion we contemplated the unconverted man as being
          bound by the cords of his sins. It was a very solemn and sorrowful
          topic. I trust it humbled us all, and made those of us whom the Son
          has made free, feel renewed gratitude for the glorious liberty of the
          children of God. Sad was the spectacle of the dungeon and the fetters,
          and the felon bound therewith, a man, a brother, the image of
          ourselves. It is a great relief to turn to another subject akin to
          that, but full of cheerfulness and joy. We showed you the prisoner: we
          have now to speak of him who came to set the prisoners free. We
          decribed the captive's cords and bonds; we have now to tell you of him
          whose mighty touch liberates the bond-slaves, and signs the Magna
          Carta of eternal emancipation. The case of manhood bound like
          Prometheus to the rock, and preyed upon by the vulture of hell,
          appeared utterly hopeless, and the more so because the prisoner was
          his own fetter, and disdained to be free. After all that has been done
          for man, by the tenderness of God, the simplicity of the gospel, and
          the clear and plain command; yes, and after all the thunders of
          threatening, followed by the wooing notes of mercy, the captive
          continues still the willing slave of sin, and his liberation appears
          utterly hopeless. But things impossible with men are possible with
          God, and where human agency fails, divine agency delights to
          illustrate its own extraordinary energy. We gladly survey at this time
          the effectual operations of Jesus the Savior, the true Victor
          Emmanuel, who comes to set men free from the bondage of their sins, to
          whose name be honor and glory world without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Looking at the first verses of this chapter, we shall consider WHO
          IT IS THAT SENDS JESUS CHRIST TO ACCOMPLISH THE LIBERATION OF THE SONS
          OF MEN, because much will depend upon the liberator's credentials, the
          authority by which he is warranted, and the power by which he is
          backed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sing for joy of heart as we see that the Infinite God himself
          commissioned the Lord Jesus to be the deliverer of men; and he did
          this, first, in his capacity as Creator. Read the fifth verse, and
          behold the great author of the Redeemer's commission: |Thus saith
          Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that
          spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it.| He, then,
          who spared not his own Son, but sent him forth on the embassage of
          love, is Jehovah, who has made the heavens a pavilion of azure, gilded
          with the sun, and bedecked with stars; the self-same all-sustaining
          One who bears up the pillars of the universe, and impels the earth in
          its majestic circuit. He who gave its lustre to every precious stone
          from the mine, its life to every blade of grass, its fruit to every
          tree, its motion to every beast and winged fowl -- for all these may
          be said to come out of the earth; he it is who sent the Incarnate God
          to open the two-leaved gates, and cut the bars of iron asunder, that
          the slaves of Satan might escape from the thraldom of their sins.
          Jesus, the Son of God, comes armed with the power of the Creator
          himself. Rejoice, then, ye that are lost, for surely the power which
          spake all things out of nothing, can new create you, though there be
          nought of good within you to aid the godlike work. Rejoice, ye that
          are marred and broken, like vessels spoiled upon the potter's wheel,
          your great Creator puts his hand a second time to the work, and
          resolves to form you for himself that you may show forth his praise.
          He by whom you were made in secret, and curiously wrought in the
          lowest parts of the earth, is able by his mysterious working to create
          in you a new heart, and infuse into you a right spirit. Is there not
          hope for the dark chaos of your fallen nature, and that heart of yours
          which is now without form and void? Is anything too hard for the Lord?
          Is there any restraint of his power? It is true your fellow-creatures,
          be they exalted never so highly by office or character, cannot
          regenerate you, the very idea is blasphemy against the prerogative of
          him who alone can create or destroy; but where the will of man, and
          blood, and birth all fail, the Spirit of the Lord achieves the
          victory. Thus saith the Lord, |Behold, I create new heavens and a new
          earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But
          be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I
          create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.| What has John
          written in the book of his vision? Is it not to the same purpose? He
          that sat upon the throne saith, |Behold, I make all things new.| He
          who made the light can open your eyes. He who bade the rivers flow,
          can open springs of penitence within your souls. He who clothed the
          earth with verdure, can make your barren minds fruitful to his praise.
          If he piled yon Alpine summits, balanced the clouds which float about
          them, and formed the valleys which laugh at their feet, he can yet
          create within the little world of man thoughts that aspire to heaven,
          desires that ascend to the realms of purity, and good works which are
          the fair products of his Spirit. Has the Creator sent forth a
          liberator to captive men? Then is there hope indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
          He who sent forth the Lord Jesus as his Elect One to restore our
          fallen race, also describes himself as the life giver; for returning
          to the fifth verse of the chapter before us, we read, |He that giveth
          breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein!|
          The Lord creates animal life: he puts breath into the nostrils of men
          and beasts; he gives also mental life -- the life which thinks,
          imagines, doubts, fears, understands, desires. All life comes from the
          central fountain of self-existence in the great I Am, in whom we live,
          and move, and have our being. This Eternal One, who has life in
          himself, has sent forth his Son to give life to those who are dead in
          trespasses and sins, and he has girded him with his own power, |For as
          the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have
          life in himself.| It is by the word of Jesus that the dead shall rise,
          |for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall
          hear his voice, and shall come forth.| Arrayed in such life-giving
          power no case of human corruption can be beyond the Redeemer's skill
          even those who rot, like Lazarus, shall come forth when he calls them,
          and the bonds of death and hell shall be loosed. Thus saith the Lord
          of life: |Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
          believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
          come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.| The
          vision of Ezekiel's valley has become a fact since Jesus has appeared;
          and it is no marvel that it should be so, since the Eternal and
          Ever-living God has sent him. He can breathe the Holy Spirit into the
          dead soul, and give the heart that palpitates with penitence, and
          leaps with desires after God. He can give eyes to the blind and feet
          to the lame. All that belongs to life he can bestow -- the hearing
          ear, the speaking tongue, the grasping hand. The great obstacle in his
          way is spiritual death, and as with a word he can remove it, the
          salvation of man is no longer a difficulty. Rejoice, ye heavens; and
          be glad, O earth; for among the graves of our sins, and into the very
          charnel-house of our corruption, the Quickener has descended, and is
          quickening whomsoever he will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is this all for he who sent the Redeemer is represented in the
          sixth verse as the faithful God. |I the Lord have called thee in
          righteousness;| that is to say, the God who sends Christ the Savior is
          not one who plays with words, and having given a promise to-day,
          retracts it to-morrow. |He is not a man, that he should lie; neither
          the son of man, that he should repent.| Immutable are his promises and
          purposes, for they are founded in righteousness. He who has
          commissioned his chosen messenger is not unrighteous to forget his
          word. Hath he said, and shall he not do it? Hath he spoken, and shall
          it not come to pass? Hence, thy dear brethren, every gospel promise
          has the stamp of the divine righteousness upon it, that you may know
          it to be true. Jesus assures us that, if we believe in him, we shall
          be delivered. God, who cannot lie, sets his seal to the promise. |He
          that believeth and is baptised shall be saved,| is not only the
          declaration of Christ, but God himself confirms it. Then, |Amen, so
          let it be!| The vilest sinner that believeth shall find life and
          pardon, acceptance and blessedness in Christ Jesus. Thou hast not to
          deal, O trembler, with one who will interpret his promise at a lower
          point than thou dost understand it at; but thou hast to deal with One
          who means more than words can express, whose thoughts are as high
          above your thoughts, even when enlightened by his Word, as the heavens
          are above the earth. |Come now, and let us reason together, saith the
          Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.| He who utters
          these words is the Lord, the faithful Promiser, who has sent forth
          Christ, not to deceive you with specious presences, but in very deed
          and truth to bring abundance of grace to those who trust him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading further in the same verse, you will perceive that the
          everblessed sender of the Lord Jesus is omnipotent, for is it not
          added, |And will hold thine hand, and will keep thee|? By which is
          meant that God will give to the Mediator all his power. Christ is the
          power of God. Omnipotence dwells in him who once was slain, but now
          ever liveth, and he is able to save unto the uttermost them that come
          unto God by him. In the gospel of Christ there is a putting forth of
          divine power as manifest as in the creation and in the upholding of
          the world. Here is our comfort under all the assaults with which the
          Christian faith is threatened, and under all the disappointments which
          the Christian church has hitherto undergone; Emmanuel, God with us, is
          still our strength. We are persuaded that the ultimate victory of the
          cross is absolutely certain, for |the glory of the Lord shall be
          revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the
          Lord hath spoken it.| The creation was a work of omnipotence, and yet
          it was not accomplished all at once. The Lord could, if he had so
          willed it, have fashioned this habitable globe in one second of time,
          and have furnished all its chambers by a single word of his mouth.
          Instead of this, we have reason to believe that he lingered in the
          first formation of it, in the beginning, when he created the heavens
          and the earth; and arranged and disarranged it many times before he
          came to the final constitution of it in the first six days of time,
          wherein he modeled it to be a fit abode for man. Even then when he
          came to the final work, not in one day did he build up chaos into the
          beautiful house of humanity. Not at first did the firmament divide the
          waters, or the dry land appear above the seas. Not till the third day
          did the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed, nor did
          sun and moon divide the empire of day and night till the fourth day
          had dawned; while the fowl that fly in the open firmament of heaven,
          and the living creatures that move in the waters, owned a yet later
          birth. Everything was gradual. Step by step the Maker advanced, get
          was there never anything less than omnipotence in every step of his
          progress. So, my brethren, the Lord might as easily have converted the
          whole world to Christ on the day of Pentecost as not, but not so had
          his decrees appointed. A step was taken in apostolic times, and the
          light shone forth in darkness; further on, the great division between
          the heavenly and the earthly became marked and clear, and the church
          rose like the dry land above the seas of sin, while the plants of the
          Lord's right-hand planting brought forth their seed and their fruit.
          Even now the appointed lights make glad the sky, and the time hastens
          on when the Lord shall more evidently bless his living ones, and say,
          |Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth;| but all is done by
          degrees as he appoints. Our impatience would fain stand at the Eternal
          elbow, and say, |Master, complete thy work, and let our eyes behold
          the Second Adam in a world restored into a second Eden.| But he
          tarries for awhile, and waits while his great appointed evenings and
          mornings fill up his week of glorious work. He delights in this
          noblest labor of his hands, and is not as the hireling who earnestly
          desireth the shadow that his toilsome task may be ended. He lingers
          lovingly, and his long suffering is salvation. The Lord's decrees
          tarry not so long but what in the divine reckoning, and according to
          the Lord's own estimate, the end will come quickly, but to the
          presumptuous who dare to say, |where is the promise of his coming?| he
          seems to linger long. How blessed will be the grand finale of
          redemption work; then shall the morning stars sing together, and all
          the sons of God shout for joy. The seventh day of redemption shall
          eclipse the Sabbath of nature, even as the new heavens and the new
          earth shall outshine the former: a river purer than Hiddekel shall
          water the new Eden, the tree of life of richer fruit shall grow in the
          midst of the garden, and then shall be fulfilled the saying which is
          written, |Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye
          lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
          forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and
          glorified himself in Israel.| As we read the promise, |I will hold
          thine hand, and will keep thee,| we see the certainty that the Savior
          girt with the allsufficiency of divine strength, will accomplish the
          work of human salvation. Be of good cheer, O children of God, and
          comfort yourselves with the belief, |that he shall see his seed, he
          shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
          his hand.| His church has no reason for fear, but every ground of
          confidence as to her future. Rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for great is
          the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
        </p>
        <p>|Fear not, though many a mighty foe</p>
        <p>Against thy walls advance;</p>
        <p>Jehovah's arm will lay them low</p>
        <p>For thy deliverance.</p>
        <p>Oh, take him at his royal word</p>
        <p>That word which cannot lie</p>
        <p>Thy shield and sword is Israel's Lord,</p>
        <p>Almighty sovereignty.|</p>
        <p>
          I know you will tell me, |most men say that the world will end in a
          few years; is it not written that the Bridegroom cometh quickly?| Yes,
          but remember that eighteen hundred years ago it was written that he
          would come quickly, and there have been prophets in all ages who have
          concluded from this that the end was near, while many believers have
          been like the Thessalonians, to whom Paul wrote: |Now we beseech you,
          brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
          together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
          neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
          day of Christ is at hand.| We have been instructed by certain
          pretended expositors to expect the time of the end for the last seven
          years, and yet it is possible that it may not arrive for the next
          seventy thousand years. Perhaps human history, as yet written, is but
          the first stanza of a wondrous poem, which shall be unfolded page by
          page for many an age to come, and it may be possible far more
          rapturous strains of divine mercy and grace in the conversion of men
          are yet to be read by angels and glorified spirits. If it be so it
          will still be true that he comes quickly, for what will time be
          compared with eternity? Even if the space taken up by the world's
          history be not a brief six thousand years, but sixty thousand times
          six thousand years, yet will it be but as a drop of a bucket compared
          with the years of the right hand of the Most High, the lifetime of the
          Ancient of Days. Fight on hopefully, my brethren, and be not
          distressed with rumors of times and seasons, but believe ye this, that
          God is, in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world unto himself, and all
          the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. Watch daily
          for the Lord's coming, but yet struggle to advance his empire, for |he
          shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the
          ends of the earth.| The Lord has not withdrawn his hand from his
          |elect, in whom his soul delighteth.| He will subdue nations before
          him, he will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the
          two-leaved gates. With such a deliverer so gloriously upheld, there is
          no room for fear of failure. Our hope and faith joyfully rest in him
          to whom the Eternal gives his almightiness wherewith to subdue all
          things unto himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We will now advance a little further, the Lord helping us. Having
          contemplated the glorious One who sent Jesus to the work of man's
          emancipation, let us, in the second place, consider the SENT ONE
          HIMSELF.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have him described in the first verse of this chapter, and the
          first words which we will select from the description inform us that
          Jesus is a chosen one. |Mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth.| God
          has been pleased to set apart his well-beloved Son to be the Savior of
          sinners, and in every way he is most suitable. As man he is supremely
          adapted for the work; no other of woman born was fitted for the
          enterprise. Born in a peculiar manner, without taint or blemish, he
          alone of human kind possessed the holy nature needful to make him
          God's messenger of love. I tried to show just now that God has girded
          our Lord with his omnipotence, and this ought to lead every sinner to
          feel that Christ can save him, for what cannot Omnipotence do? We may
          not talk of impossibilities or even difficulties when we have
          almightiness before us. No sinner can be difficult to save, no bonds
          hard to remove, when God, the Almighty One, comes forth to save. Now
          look at the other side of the picture, and remember that Christ Jesus
          was the most suitable person in whom the Father could place the
          fullness of his saving power. In his complex person he is every way
          adapted to stand as mediator between God and man. He who laid help
          upon one that is mighty, and exalted one chosen out of the people, was
          guided by infallible wisdom in his choice. None other was so fit as
          he; in fact there was no other. |Other foundation can no man lay than
          that is laid.| Other door of hope can no man open than that which God
          has opened in the person of Christ. O sinner, I beseech thee accept
          what God has wisely chosen. Let God's choice be thy willing choice. At
          this hour, constrained by the grace of God, say, |If God has chosen
          the Lord Jesus to be a propitiation for sin, my heart accepts him as
          the atonement for my sin, feeling that he alone can save me.| If thus
          thou dost elect the Lord's elect One, thou shalt find him precious.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we are also told in the first verse that the Lord Jesus is
          anointed to this work, as well as a choice one for it. |I have put my
          Spirit upon him.| Now, the Holy Spirit is the greatest of all actors
          in the world of mind. He it is who can illuminate, persuade, and
          control the spirits of men. He doeth as he wills with mind, even as in
          the first creation the Lord wrought as he willed with matter. Now, if
          Jesus Christ has the fullness of the Holy Spirit resting upon him, it
          is not supposable that any sinner shall be so desperately enslaved
          that he cannot set him free. We are about to speak of blind eyes to be
          opened, but in the light of the Holy Spirit what eye need remain
          blind? We shall speak of captives to be liberated, but with God's free
          Spirit to loose him what soul need be bound? Bold men have taught
          doctrines which have emancipated the minds of their fellows from the
          slavery of superstition, but the Holy Ghost's teachings deliver minds
          from bondage of every kind, and make men free before the living God.
          Trembling sinner, accept Christ as your Savior; God appoints him; God
          anoints him. Are not these two reasons sufficient to make him
          acceptable to your soul?
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the Redeemer is spoken of as being gentle and lowly of
          heart, which should commend him much to every lowly and contrite
          spirit. |A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
          he not quench.| We need a Savior who can be touched with the feeling
          of our infirmities, and Jesus is such. Souls conscious of sin are very
          tender, and agitated with many fears; to cure a wounded conscience is
          no fool's work, but fit labor for the most experienced physician. See
          you, then, how fitted Christ is. He never yet said an unkind word to a
          soul that desired to find mercy at his hands. In the records of his
          life you may find him try, but you shall never see him repel, an
          anxious spirit. When feeble faith could only touch the hem of his
          garment, yet virtue flowed from him. When the leper said, |Lord, if
          thou wilt, thou canst make me clean,| it was but poor faith, but that
          faith saved him. Though you cannot yet believe as you would, yet say,
          |Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief,| and he will not reject
          you. Look at the smoking candle-wick which yields no light, but makes
          much offensive smoke; yet, perchance, a living fire lingers in it, and
          therefore the tender Savior will not quench it, but will even fan it
          to a flame. And that bruised reed, how it mars the music of the pipes;
          draw it out and break it. So would men do, but not so the sinner's
          Friend. He makes it perfect yet again, and pours the music of his love
          through it. O thou who art in thine own esteem utterly worthless, only
          fit to be thrown away, unfit to live and unfit to die; Jesus Christ,
          the gentle One, will give thee mercy, if thou seek him, and in giving
          he will not upbraid thee. O wandering child, Jesus will introduce thee
          to his Father, who will kiss thee with the kisses of his love, and
          take off thy rags of sin, and clothe thee with glorious robes of
          righteousness. Only come thou to him, for he is such an one that he
          cannot reject thee. |How can I come?| saith one. A prayer will bring
          thee; an anxious desire will be as a chariot to thee. A trust in him
          hath brought thee, and Christ is thine, if thou dost now accept him.
          If thy soul is truly willing to have Christ, Christ hath made thee
          willing, and has already begun to set thee free. May these thoughts
          concerning the great Emancipator cheer thee on to confidence in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One point more in this direction. The Christ who has come to save the
          sons of men is persevering to the last degree. |He shall not fail, nor
          be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles
          shall wait for his law.| Men are unwilling to be saved; they do not
          desire to be brought out of their prison-houses; but Jesus Christ will
          not cease to teach, nor cease to seek, nor cease to save, till every
          one of his elect is redeemed from the ruin of the fall, and until a
          multitude beyond all count shall surround the Father's throne. I tell
          thee, soul, if Christ wills to save thee, he will save thee. He will
          track thy footsteps, wander where thou mayst. If thou shouldest escape
          time after time, from the arrows of conviction, and plunge again and
          again into sin, yet will he seek thee out and find thee yet. O delay
          not, but yield to his power! I pray that he may stretch out his
          sovereign arm at this moment, and rescue thee from thyself. If thy
          heart were as adamant, or as the nether millstone, he can dissolve it
          with a touch. O that the rock-breaking hammer would come down upon
          thee now! He is mighty to save; may he prove his mightiness in thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is time that we expound the text itself, and review THE WORK
          ITSELF.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the text, the Messiah's work of grace is divided into
          three parts, of which the first is, to open the blind eyes. Here is a
          notable work which brings much glory to our Lord. Man's understanding
          is perverted from the knowledge of God, from a true sense of sin, from
          a realisation of divine justice, from a right estimate of salvation.
          The understanding, which is the eye of the soul, is darkened. But when
          the anointed Savior comes, he removes the scales of our mental
          ophthalmia, and in the light of God we see light, and then the sinner
          is humbled and bowed down, for he perceives his guilt and the justice
          of God. Moreover, he is filled with alarm, for he sees the bleeding
          Savior bearing Jehovah's wrath, and rightly judges that in every case
          sin must receive a recompense of wrath; for if sin laid on Christ was
          punished, how much more must personal sin involve banishment from the
          presence of the Most High? The sinner is then made to see that the
          only way in which sin can be removed is through the expiatory
          sufferings of a substitute. He is led to see that the atonement avails
          for him upon his believing. He is led to understand what believing is.
          He does believe; he trusts, and then in trusting he is made to see the
          completeness of pardon, and the glory of the justification which comes
          to us by faith in Jesus Christ. You may think that this is an easy
          thing for men to see, trained in the doctrine of it from their
          childhood, and hearing it incessantly from the pulpit; but, believe
          me, simple as it seems to he, no man receives it unless it has been
          given him from heaven. We may say to each one who has seen all this,
          |Blessed art thou, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
          thee.| Many of us heard the gospel from our childhood, but until the
          Holy Spirit explained to us what it was to be a sinner, and what it
          was to believe in Jesus, we did not know even the rudiments of the
          gospel. We were in darkness ourselves, though the light shone round
          about us; and well might we be, for our eyes were not opened. When
          Jesus came we saw it all, and we understood the mystery. Our once
          blind eyes clearly saw ourselves lost, and Christ suffering instead of
          us; we believed in him, our sins disappeared, and we were accepted in
          the Beloved. My dear friend, if thou art seeking rest, I pray the Lord
          to open thine eyes to see the simplicities of the gospel. One touch of
          his finger will make thee wise unto salvation. There is no need for
          thee to study the twenty-one folio volumes of Albertus Magnus, or even
          the fifty-two volumes of John Calvin, for the whole secret of the
          gospel lies in these few words, |Believe and live;| yet thou canst not
          open the casket unless the Lord give thee the secret key. It needs an
          opened eye to see even through a glass window; the clear witness of
          the gospel is dark to blind eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next work of the Messiah, according to the text, is to bring out
          the prisoners front the prison. This, I think, relates to the bondage
          under which a man lies to his sins. Habits of sin, like iron nets,
          surround the sinner, and he cannot escape their meshes. The man sins,
          and imagines that he cannot help sinning. How often do the ungodly
          tell us that they cannot renounce the world, cannot break off their
          sins by righteousness, and cannot believe in Jesus? Let all men know
          that the Savior has come on purpose to remove every bond of sin from
          the captive, and to set him free from every, chain of evil. I have
          known men strive against the habit of blasphemy, others against
          unchaste passions, and many more against a haughty spirit, or an angry
          temper; and when they have strived manfully but unsuccessfully in
          their own strength, they have been filled with bitter chagrin that
          they should have been so betrayed by themselves. When a man believes
          in Jesus his resolve to become a freeman is to a great extent
          accomplished at once. Some sins die the moment we believe in Jesus,
          and trouble us no more; others hang on to us, and die by slow degrees,
          but they are overcome so as never again to get the mastery over us. O
          struggler after mental, moral, spiritual liberty, if thou wouldst be
          free, thine only possible freedom is in Christ. If thou wouldst shake
          off evil habits or any other mental bondage, I shall prescribe no
          remedy to thee but this, to commit thyself to Christ the Liberator.
        </p>
        <p>|The gates of brass before him burst,</p>
        <p>The iron fetters yield.|</p>
        <p>
          Love him, and thou shalt hate sin. Trust him, and thou shalt no more
          trust thyself. Submit thyself to the sway of the incarnate God, and he
          will break the dragon's head within thee, and hurl Satan beneath thy
          feet. Nothing else can do it. Christ must have the glory of thy
          conquest of self. He can set thee free from sin's iron yoke. He never
          failed yet, and he never shall. I earnestly entreat any man who
          desires to break off his sins (and we must break them off or perish by
          them), to try this divine remedy, and see if it does not give him holy
          liberty. Ask the thousands who have already believed in Jesus, and
          their testimony will confirm my doctrine. Faith in the Lord Jesus is
          the end of bondage and the dawn of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of this divine work is, bringing them that sit in
          darkness out of the prison-house. This we will refer to those who are
          truly emancipated, and yet by reason of despondency sit down in the
          dark dungeon. We have in our pastoral duties constantly to console
          persons who are free from their sins, having by divine grace got the
          mastery over them, but yet they are in sadness. The door is open, the
          bars are broken, but with strange obstinacy of despondency they remain
          in the cell of fear, in which there is no necessity for them to
          continue for a moment. They cannot believe that these good things are
          true to them. They forgiven? They could believe everybody else to be
          pardoned but themselves. They made the children of God? Nay, they
          could hope for their sisters; they have joy in knowing that their
          father is a child of God, but as to themselves -- can such blessings
          really fall to the lot of such unworthy ones? We have talked with
          hundreds of such and tried to console them, but we have only learned
          our own unskilfulness in the art of consolation. They are rich in
          inventions for self-torture, ingenious in escaping comfort. But, ah!
          the blessed Master of our souls, whose business it has been since Adam
          fell to bind up broken hearts, is never foiled. When his eternal
          Spirit comes to anoint with the oil of joy, he soon gives beauty for
          ashes. The mournful sentinel of the night-watches must rejoice when
          the day breaketh and the Sun of righteousness shines forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I speak to you in very common-place language, yet the theme
          is rich. This one thought alone ought to make our hearts dance for
          joy, to think that the Christ of God undertakes to lift up desponding
          and despairing spirits into hope and joy once more. I know who will
          rejoice to hear this. It is yonder good woman, who these many years
          has been in spiritual bondage. It is yonder young man, who has carried
          a secret burden month after month. It is yonder aged man, who longs to
          find Christ ere he gathers up his feet in his dying bed, and who
          thinks that his hour of grace has passed. Man, it is not so. Christ is
          still mighty to save. Still doth the message run: |He that believeth
          on him is not condemned.| |Whosoever will, let him take the water of
          life freely.| |Go, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
          and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
          and milk without money and without price.| Prisoners of hope, your
          liberator is near at hand. Trust him and be free. Though it seem a
          venturesome believing, yet venture on him. He cannot, will not reject
          you; he will proclaim a jubilee, and set each bondslave free.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, then, how the great Redeemer blessed us: Jesus the Christ does
          all things well; he clears the understanding; he breaks the power of
          sinful habits; he removes the load of despondency; he doth it all.
          Christ Jesus, Mary's son and Jehovah's son man, bone of our bone and
          flesh of our flesh, yet God over all, blessed for ever; he who died on
          Calvary, whose precious blood is the panacea for all human ills, he it
          is, and he only, who is the Liberator of our fallen race.
        </p>
        <p>IV. WHAT IS THE DESIGN OF GOD IN ALL THIS?</p>
        <p>
          This question is answered in the next verse to the text: |I am the
          Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another.| The
          great end of God in Christ was the manifestation of his own glorious
          attributes -- a simple truth, but big with comfort, for should the
          sinner who has been an atrocious offender against laws human and
          divine conceive himself to be an improper subject for the grace of
          God, I would take him by the hand, and lest despair drive him to
          further sin, I would put this truth clearly before him. Where is mercy
          most glorified? Is it not in passing by the greatest offenses? Thou
          hast great offenses; there is room in thee for mercy to be greatly
          displaced. Where is grace glorified? Is it not in conquering the most
          violent passions? Thou hast such; grace may therefore be glorified in
          thee. Why, great sinner, instead of not being a fit subject for grace,
          I will venture to say that thou art in all respects one of the most
          suitable. There is elbow-room in thee for grace to work. There is room
          in thine emptiness for God's fullness. There is a clear stage in thy
          sinfulness for God's superabounding grace. But you have been a
          ringleader in the devil's army. Yes, and how can God strike a more
          telling blow against the hosts of darkness than by capturing you? But
          you tell me that you are an enormous sinner. How will the Lord of love
          encourage other sinners to come better than by calling you? For it
          will be rumoured about among your fellow-sinners:-|Have you heard that
          such an one is saved?| I know they will jeer, but still, in their
          secret hearts, they will think it over, and they will say, |How is
          this?| and they will be led to enquire into the ways of God's grace. A
          brother told the church, a short time since, a little of his history,
          and it caused us all to rejoice in sovereign grace. He had lived in
          all manner of sin and iniquity; his profession had been for some years
          that of a public runner, and in that course of life he was brought
          into collision with the scum of society. He was practiced, also, in
          the pugilistic art, and that, we all know, is the very reverse of
          having an elevating tendency. But he came to the Tabernacle, and here
          Jesus met with him, and he rejoices now to teach to others the gospel
          which he once rejected. But what, think you has he been accustomed to
          do these three years? Some of our brethren preach in the streets, and
          he goes with them, and after they have told of what the grace of God
          can do, he humbly and yet boldly rises and says, |I am a living
          witness to what grace can do; I can declare to you what God's love has
          done for me.| If the sermon which precedes his little speech has not
          interested the people, they are quite certain to be struck with his
          personal testimony, for in some localities many of the street folk
          know him, and as they look at him they say, |Why, that is old
          so-and-so. I knew him when he was this and that, and here he is
          converted;| and his witness-bearing works mightily among his old
          friends and acquaintances. I say, then, if now I speak to any other
          who has been a great offender, a drunkard, or what not, if my Master
          does but set you free and enlist you in his army, there will be such a
          shout go up in the hosts of Israel as shall make heaven ring, while
          the Philistines shall tremble, for their Goliath shall be slain, and a
          new champion raised up from his dead body to fight for the Lord of
          hosts. If the Lord saved men because of their merits, there would be
          no hope for great sinners, nor indeed for any one; but if he saves us
          for his own glory, that he may magnify his grace and his mercy among
          the sons of men, then none need despair. Up to the very gates of hell
          would I preach the gospel, and between the jaws of death would I
          proclaim it. God to glorify his grace sets free the captives, then why
          should not the most hell-deserving sinner, whose heart is like
          hardened steel, yet become a monument of Christ's power to save? I
          remember one who used to say that if God would but have mercy on him
          he should never hear the last of it, and it may well be the resolve of
          all of us, that earth and heaven shall never hear the last of our
          praises if grace shall but save us. As one of our hymns puts it
        </p>
        <p>|Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heaven's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace.|</p>
        <p>
          Yes, we will each sing loudest, each owing most, each desiring,
          therefore, to bend the lowest and to praise the most heartily, the
          grace which has set us free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time flies with us; days are rushing past; years are hastening away.
          How long shall it be ere Christ shall gain your hearts? How long shall
          ye hear of him, and continue to refuse his grace? How long, ye
          unconverted ones, will ye hug your chains and kiss your fetters? |Turn
          ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of
          Israel?| |Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him
          while he is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
          man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have
          mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.|
