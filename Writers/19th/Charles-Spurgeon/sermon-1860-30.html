        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.329)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 19th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          |From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
          kingdom of heaven is at hand| -- Matthew 4:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          |And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
          name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem| -- Luke 24:47.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT SEEMS from these two texts that repentance was the first subject
          upon which the Redeemer dwelt, and that it was the last, which, with
          his departing breath, he commended to the earnestness of his
          disciples. He begins his mission crying, |Repent,| he ends it by
          saying to his successors the apostles, |Preach repentance and
          remission of sins among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.| This
          seems to me to be a very interesting fact, and not simply interesting,
          but instructive. Jesus Christ opens his commission by preaching
          repentance. What then? Did he not by this act teach us how important
          repentance was -- so important that the very first time he opens his
          mouth, he shall begin with, |Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
          hand.| Did he not feel that repentance was necessary to be preached
          before he preached faith in himself, because the soul must first
          repent of sin before it will seek a Saviour, or even care to know
          whether there is a Saviour at all? And did he not also indicate to us
          that as repentance was the opening lesson of the divine teaching, so,
          if we would be his disciples, we must begin by sitting on the stool of
          repentance, before we can possibly go upward to the higher forms of
          faith and of full assurance? Jesus at the first begins with
          repentance, -- that repentance may be the Alpha, the first letter of
          the spiritual alphabet which all believers must learn; and when he
          concluded his divine commission with repentance, what did he say to us
          but this -- that repentance was still of the very last importance? He
          preaches it with his first, he will utter it with his last breath;
          with this he begins, with this he will conclude. He knew that
          repentance was, to spiritual life, a sort of Alpha and Omega -- it was
          the duty of the beginning, it was the duty of the end. He seemed to
          say to us, |Repentance, which I preached to you three years ago, when
          I first came into the world, as a public teacher, is as binding, as
          necessary for you who heard me then, and who then obeyed my voice, as
          it was at the very first instant, and it is equally needful that you
          who have been with me from the beginning, should not imagine that the
          theme is exhausted and out of date; you too must begin your ministry
          and conclude it with the same exhortation, Repent and be converted,
          for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'| It seems to me that nothing
          could set forth Jesus Christ's idea of the high value of repentance,
          more fully and effectually than the fact that he begins with it, and
          that he concludes with it -- that he should say, |Repent,| as the
          key-note of his ministry, preaching this duty before he fully develops
          all the mystery of godliness, and that he should close his life-song
          as a good composer must, with his first key-note, bidding his
          disciples still cry, |Repentance and remission of sins are preached in
          Jesus' name.| I feel then that I need no further apology for
          introducing to your solemn and serious attention, the subject of
          saving repentance. And oh! while we are talking of it, may God the
          Holy Ghost breathe into all our spirits, and may we now repent before
          him, and now find those blessings which he hath promised to the
          penitent.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to repentance, these four things: -- first, its origin;
          secondly, its essentials; thirdly, its companions; and fourthly, its
          excellencies.
        </p>
        <p>I. Repentance -- ITS ORIGIN.</p>
        <p>
          When we cry, |Repent and be converted,| there are some foolish men who
          call us legal. Now we beg to state, at the opening of this first
          point, that repentance is of gospel parentage. It was not born near
          Mount Sinai. It never was brought forth anywhere but upon Mount Zion.
          Of course, repentance is a duty -- a natural duty -- because, when man
          hath sinned, who is there brazen enough to say that it is not man's
          bounden duty to repent of having done so? It is a duty which even
          nature itself would teach. But gospel repentance was never yet
          produced as a matter of duty. It was never brought forth in the soul
          by demands of law, nor indeed can the law, except as the instrument in
          the hand of grace, even assist the soul towards saving repentance. It
          is a remarkable fact that the law itself makes no provision for
          repentance. It says, |This do, and thou shalt live; break my command,
          and thou shalt die.| There is nothing said about penitence; there is
          no offer of pardon made to those that repent. The law pronounces its
          deadly curse upon the man that sins but once, but it offers no way of
          escape, no door by which the man may be restored to favour. The barren
          sides of Sinai have no soil in which to nourish the lovely plant of
          penitence. Upon Sinai the dew of mercy never fell. Its lightnings and
          its thunders have frightened away the angel of Mercy once for all, and
          there Justice sits, with sword of flame, upon its majestic throne of
          rugged rock, never purposing for a moment to put up its sword into the
          scabbard, and to forgive the offender. Read attentively the twentieth
          chapter of Exodus. You have the commandments there all thundered forth
          with trumpet voice, but there is no pause between where Mercy with her
          silver voice may step in and say, |But if ye break this law, God will
          have mercy upon you, and will shew himself gracious if ye repent.| No
          words of repentance, I say, were ever proclaimed by the law; no
          promise by it made to penitents; and no assistance is by the law ever
          offered to those who desire to be forgiven. Repentance is a gospel
          grace. Christ preached it, but not Moses. Moses neither can nor will
          assist a soul to repent, only Jesus can use the law as a means of
          conviction and an argument for repentance. Jesus gives pardon to those
          who seek it with weeping and with tears; but Moses knows of no such
          thing. If repentance is ever obtained by the poor sinner, it must be
          found at the foot of the cross, and not where the ten commandments lie
          shivered at Sinai's base.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as repentance is of gospel parentage, I make a second remark, it
          is also of gracious origin. Repentance was never yet produced in any
          man's heart apart from the grace of God. As soon may you expect the
          leopard to regret the blood with which its fangs are moistened, -- as
          soon might you expect the lion of the wood to abjure his cruel tyranny
          over the feeble beasts of the plain, as expect the sinner to make any
          confession, or offer any repentance that shall be accepted of God,
          unless grace shall first renew the heart. Go and loose the bands of
          everlasting winter in the frozen north with your own feeble breath,
          and then hope to make tears of penitence bedew the cheek of the
          hardened sinner. Go ye and divide the earth, and pierce its bowels
          with an infant's finger, and then hope that your eloquent appeal,
          unassisted by divine grace, shall be able to penetrate the adamantine
          heart of man. Man can sin, and he can continue in it, but to leave the
          hateful element is a work for which he needs a power divine. As the
          river rushes downward with increasing fury, leaping from crag to crag
          in ponderous cataracts of power, so is the sinner in his sin; onward
          and downward, onward, yet more swiftly, more mightily, more
          irresistibly, in his hellish course. Nothing but divine grace can bid
          that cataract leap upward, or make the floods retrace the pathway
          which they have worn for themselves down the rocks. Nothing, I say,
          but the power which made the world, and digged the foundations of the
          great deep, can ever make the heart of man a fountain of life from
          which the floods of repentance may gush forth. So then, soul, if thou
          shalt ever repent, it must be a repentance, not of nature, but of
          grace. Nature can imitate repentance; it can produce remorse; it can
          generate the feeble resolve; it can even lead to a partial, practical
          reform; but unaided nature cannot touch the vitals and new-create the
          soul. Nature may make the eyes weep, but it cannot make the heart
          bleed. Nature can bid you amend your ways, but it cannot renew your
          heart. No, you must look upward, sinner; you must look upward to him
          who is able to save unto the uttermost. You must at his hands receive
          the meek and tender spirit; from his finger must come the touch that
          shall dissolve the rock; and from his eye must dart the flash of love
          and light that can scatter the darkness of your impenitence. Remember,
          then, at the outset, that true repentance is of gospel origin, and is
          not the work of the law; and on the other hand, it is of gracious
          origin, and is not the work of the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But to pass forward from this first point to our second head, let
          us notice the ESSENTIALS of true repentance. The old divines adopted
          various methods of explaining penitence. Some of them said it was a
          precious medicine, compounded of six things; but in looking over their
          divisions, I have felt that I might with equal success divide
          repentance into four different ingredients. This precious box of
          ointment which must be broken over the Saviour's heard before the
          sweet perfume of peace can ever be smelt in the soul -- this precious
          ointment is compounded of four most rare, most costly things. God give
          them to us and then give us the compound itself mixed by the Master's
          hand. True repentance consists of illumination, humiliation,
          detestation, and transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take them one by one. The first part of true repentance consists of
          illumination. Man by nature is impenitent, because he does not know
          himself to be guilty. There are many acts which he commits in which he
          sees no sin, and even in great and egregious faults, he often knows
          that he is not right, but he does not perceive the depth, the horrible
          enormity of the sin which is involved in them. Eye-salve is one of the
          first medicines which the Lord uses with the soul. Jesus touches the
          eye of the understanding, and the man becomes guilty in his own sight,
          as he always was guilty in the sight of God. Crimes long forgotten
          start up from the grave where his forgetfulness had buried them; sins,
          which he thought were no sins, suddenly rise up on their true
          character, and acts, which he thought were perfect, now discover
          themselves to have been so mixed with evil motive that they were far
          from being acceptable with God. The eye is no more blind, and
          therefore the heart is no more proud, for the seeing eye will make a
          humble heart. If I must paint a picture of penitence in this first
          stage, I should portray a man with his eyes bandaged walking through a
          path infested with the most venomous vipers; vipers which have formed
          a horrible girdle about his loins, and are hanging like bracelets from
          his wrists. The man is so blind that he knows not where he is, nor
          what it is which he fancies to be a jewelled belt upon his arm. I
          would then in the picture touch his eyes and bid you see his horror,
          and his astonishment, when he discovers where he is and what he is. He
          looks behind him, and he sees through what broods of vipers he has
          walked; he looks before him, and he sees how thickly his future path
          is strewed with these venomous beasts. He looks about him, and in his
          living bosom looking out from his guilty heart, he sees the head of a
          vile serpent, which has twisted its coils into his very vitals. I
          would try, if I could, to throw into that face, horror, dismay, dread,
          and sorrow, a longing to escape, an anxious desire to get rid of all
          these things which must destroy him unless he should escape from them.
          And now, my dear hearers, have you ever been the subject of this
          divine illumination? Has God, who said to an unformed world, |Let
          there be light,| has he said, |Let there be light| in your poor
          benighted soul? Have you learned that your best deeds have been vile,
          and that as for your sinful acts they are ten thousand times more
          wicked than ever you believed them to be? I will not believe that you
          have ever repented unless you have first received divine illumination.
          I cannot expect a blind eye to see the filth upon a black hand, nor
          can I ever believe that the understanding which has never been
          enlightened can detect the sin which has stained your daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to illumination, comes humiliation. The soul having seen itself,
          bows before God, strips itself of all its vain boasting, and lays
          itself flat on its face before the throne of mercy. It could talk
          proudly once of merit, but now it dares not pronounce the word. Once
          it could boast itself before God, with |God, I thank thee that I am
          not as other men are|; but now it stands in the distance, and smites
          upon its breast, crying, |God be merciful to me a sinner.| Now the
          haughty eye, the proud look, which God abhorreth, are cast away, and
          the eye, instead thereof, becomes a channel of tears -- its floods are
          perpetual, it mourneth, it weepeth, and the soul crieth out both day
          and night before God, for it is vexed with itself, because it has
          vexed the Holy Spirit, and is grieved within itself because it hath
          grieved the Most High. Here if I had to depict penitence, I should
          borrow the picture of the men of Calais before our conquering king.
          There they kneel, with ropes about their necks, clad in garments of
          sackcloth, and ashes cast about their heads, confessing that they
          deserve to die; but stretching out their hands they implore mercy; and
          one who seems the personification of the angel of mercy -- or rather,
          of Christ Jesus, the God of mercy -- stands pleading with the king to
          spare their lives. Sinner, thou hast never repented unless that rope
          has been about thy neck after a spiritual fashion, if thou hast not
          felt that hell is thy just desert, and that if God banish thee for
          ever from himself, to the place where hope and peace can never come,
          he has only done with thee what thou hast richly earned. If thou hast
          not felt that the flames of hell are the ripe harvest which thy sins
          have sown, thou hast never yet repented at all. We must acknowledge
          the justice of the penalty as well as the guilt of the sin, or else it
          is but a mock repentance which we pretend to possess. Down on thy
          face, sinner, down on thy face; put away thine ornaments from thee,
          that he may know what to do with thee. No more anoint thine head and
          wash thy face, but fast and bow thy head and mourn. Thou hast made
          heaven mourn, thou hast made earth sad, thou hast digged hell for
          thyself. Confess thine iniquity with shame, and with confusion of
          face; bow down before the God of mercy and acknowledge that if he
          spare thee it will be his free mercy that shall do it; but if he
          destroy thee, thou shalt not have one word to say against the justice
          of the solemn sentence. Such a stripping does the Holy Spirit give,
          when he works this repentance, that men sometimes under it sink so low
          as even to long for death in order to escape from the burden which
          soul-humiliation has cast upon them. I do not desire that you should
          have that terror, but I do pray that you may have no boasting left,
          that you may stop your mouth and feel that if now the judgment hour
          were set, and the judgment day were come, you must stand speechless,
          even though God should say, |Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire
          in hell.| Without this I say there is no genuine evangelical
          repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third ingredient is detestation. The soul must go a step further
          than mere sorrow; it must come to hate sin, to hate the very shadow of
          it, to hate the house where once sin and it were boon companions, to
          hate the bed of pleasure and all its glittering tapestries, yea, to
          hate the very garments spotted with the flesh. There is no repentance
          where a man can talk lightly of sin, much less where he can speak
          tenderly and lovingly of it. When sin cometh to thee delicately, like
          Agag, saying, |Surely the bitterness of death is past,| if thou hast
          true repentance it will rise like Samuel and hew thy Agag in pieces
          before the Lord. As long as thou harbourest one idol in thy heart, God
          will never dwell there. Thou must break not only the images of wood
          and of stone, but of silver and of gold; yea, the golden calf itself,
          which has been thy chief idolatry, must be ground in powder and
          mingled in the bitter water of penitence, and thou must be made to
          drink thereof. There is such a loathing of sin in the soul of the true
          penitent that he cannot bear its name. If you were to compel him to
          enter its palaces he would be wretched. A penitent cannot bear himself
          in the house of the profane. He feels as if the house must fall upon
          him. In the assembly of the wicked he would be like a dove in the
          midst of ravenous kites. As well may the sheep lick blood with the
          wolf, as well may the dove be comrade at the vulture's feast of
          carrion, as a penitent sinner revel in sin. Through infirmity he may
          slide into it, but through grace he will rise out of it and abhor even
          his clothes in which he has fallen into the ditch (Job 9:31). The
          sinner unrepentant, like the sow, wallows in the mire; but the
          penitent sinner, like the swallow, may sometimes dip his wings in the
          limpid pool of iniquity, but he is aloft again, twittering forth with
          the chattering of the swallow most pitiful words of penitence, for he
          grieves that he should have so debased himself and sinned against his
          God. My hearer, if thou dost not so hate thy sins as to be ready to
          give them all up -- if thou art not willing now to hang them on
          Haman's gallows a hundred and twenty cubits high -- if thou canst not
          shake them off from thee as Paul did the viper from his hand, and
          shake it into the fire with detestation, then, I say, thou knowest not
          the grace of God in truth; for if thou lovest sin thou lovest neither
          God nor thyself, but thou choosest thine own damnation. Thou art in
          friendship with death and in league with hell; God deliver thee from
          this wretched state of heart, and bring thee to detest thy sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          There lacks one more ingredient yet. We have had illumination,
          humiliation, and detestation. There must be another thing, namely, a
          thorough transformation, for --
        </p>
        <p>|Repentance is to leave</p>
        <p>The sins we loved before,</p>
        <p>And show that we in earnest grieve</p>
        <p>By doing so no more.|</p>
        <p>
          The penitent man reforms his outward life. The reform is not partial,
          but in heart, it is universal and complete. Infirmity may mar it, but
          grace will always be striving against human infirmity, and the man
          will hate and abandon every false way. Tell me not, deceptive
          tradesman, that you have repented of your sin while lying placards are
          still upon your goods. Tell me not, thou who wast once a drunkard,
          that thou hast turned to God while yet the cup is dear to thee, and
          thou canst still wallow in it by excess. Come not to me and say I have
          repented, thou avaricious wretch, whilst thou art yet grinding thine
          almost cent, per cent, out of some helpless tradesman whom thou hast
          taken like a spider in thy net. Come not to me and say thou are
          forgiven, when thou still harboureth revenge and malice against thy
          brother, and speaketh against thine own mother's son. Thou liest to
          thine own confusion. Thy face is as the whore's forehead that is
          brazen, if thou darest to say |I have repented,| when thine arms are
          up to the elbow in the filth of thine iniquity. Nay, man, God will not
          forgive your lusts while you are still revelling in the bed of your
          uncleanness. And do you imagine he will forgive your drunken feasts
          while you are still sitting at the glutton's table! Shall he forgive
          your profanity when your tongue is still quivering with an oath? Think
          you that God shall forgive your daily transgressions when you repeat
          them again, and again, and again, wilfully plunging into the mire? He
          will wash thee, man, but he will not wash thee for the sake of
          permitting thee to plunge in again and defile thyself once more.
          |Well,| do I hear you say, |I do feel that such a change as that has
          taken place in me.| I am glad to hear it, my dear sir; but I must ask
          you a further question. Divine transformation is not merely in act but
          in the very soul; the new man not only does not sin as he used to do,
          but he does not want to sin as he used to do. The flesh-pots of Egypt
          sometimes send up a sweet smell in his nostrils, and when he passes by
          another man's house, where the leek, and garlic, and onion are
          steaming in the air, he half wishes to go back again to his Egyptian
          bondage, but in a moment he checks himself, saying, |No, no; the
          heavenly manna is better than this; the water out of the rock is
          sweeter than the waters of the Nile, and I cannot return to my old
          slavery under my old tyrant.| There may be insinuations of Satan, but
          his soul rejects them, and agonizes to cast them out. His very heart
          longs to be free from every sin, and if he could be perfect he would.
          There is not one sin he would spare. If you want to give him pleasure,
          you need not ask him to go to your haunt of debauchery; it would be
          the greatest pain to him you could imagine. It is not only his customs
          and manners, but his nature that is changed. You have not put new
          leaves on the tree, but there is a new root to it. It is not merely
          new branches, but there is a new trunk altogether, and new sap, and
          there will be new fruit as the result of this newness. A glorious
          transformation is wrought by a gracious God. His penitence has become
          so real and so complete that the man is not the man he used to be. He
          is a new creature in Christ Jesus. If you are renewed by grace, and
          were to meet your old self, I am sure you would be very anxious to get
          out of his company. |No,| say you, |no, sir, I cannot accompany you.|
          |Why, you used to swear|! |I cannot now.| |Well, but,| says he, |you
          and I are very near companions.| |Yes, I know we are, and I wish we
          were not. You are a deal of trouble to me every day. I wish I could be
          rid of you for ever.| |But,| says Old Self, |you used to drink very
          well.| |Yes, I know it. I know thou didst, indeed, Old Self. Thou
          couldst sing a song as merrily as any one. Thou wast ringleader in all
          sorts of vice, but I am no relation of thine now. Thou art of the old
          Adam, and I of the new Adam. Thou art of thine old father, the devil;
          but I have another -- my Father, who is in heaven.| I tell you,
          brethren, there is no man in the world you will hate so much as your
          old self, and there will be nothing you will so much long to get rid
          of as that old man who once was dragging you down to hell, and who
          will try his hand at it over and over again every day you live, and
          who will accomplish it yet, unless that divine grace which has made
          you a new man shall keep you a new man even to the end.

        <p>
          Good Rowland Hill, in his |Village Dialogues,| gives the Christian,
          whom he describes in the first part of the book, the name of Thomas
          Newman. Ah! and everyman who goes to heaven must have the name of
          new-man. We must not expect to enter there unless we are created anew
          in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that
          we should walk in them. I have thus, as best I could, feeling many and
          very sad distractions in my own mind, endeavored to explain the
          essentials of true repentance -- illumination, humiliation,
          detestation, transformation. The endings of the words, though they are
          long words may commend them to your attention and assist you to retain
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, with all brevity, let me notice, in the third place, the
          COMPANIONS of true repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her first companion is faith. There was a question once asked by the
          old Puritan divines -- Which was first in the soul, Faith or
          Repentance? Some said that a man could not truly repent of sin until
          he believed in God, and had some sense of a Saviour's love. Others
          said a man could not have faith till he had repented of sin; for he
          must hate sin before he could trust Christ. So a good old minister who
          was present made the following remark: |Brethren,| said he, |I don't
          think you can ever settle this question. It would be something like
          asking whether, when an infant is born, the circulation of the blood,
          or the beating of the pulse can be first observed|? Said he, |It seems
          to me that faith and repentance are simultaneous. They come at the
          same moment. There could be no true repentance without faith. There
          never was yet true faith without sincere repentance.| We endorse that
          opinion. I believe they are like the Siamese twins; they are born
          together, and they could not live asunder, but must die if you attempt
          to separate them. Faith always walks side by side with his weeping
          sister, true Repentance. They are born in the same house at the same
          hour, and they will live in the same heart every day, and on your
          dying bed, while you will have faith on the one hand to draw the
          curtain of the next world, you will have repentance, with its tears,
          as it lets fall the curtain upon the world from which you are
          departing. You will have at the last moment to weep over your own
          sins, and yet you shall see through that tear the place where tears
          are washed away. Some say there is no faith in heaven. Perhaps there
          is not. If there be none, then there will be no repentance, but if
          there be faith there will be repentance, for where faith lives,
          repentance must live with it. They are so united, so married and
          allied together, that they never can be parted, in time or in
          eternity. Hast thou, then, faith in Jesus? Does thy soul look up and
          trust thyself in his hands? If so, then hast thou the repentance that
          needeth not to be repented of.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another sweet thing which always goes with repentance, just
          as Aaron went with Moses, to be spokesman for him, for you must know
          that Moses was slow of speech, and so is repentance. Repentance has
          fine eyes, but stammering lips. In fact, it usually happens that
          repentance speaks through her eyes and cannot speak with her lips at
          all, except her friend -- who is a good spokesman -- is near; he is
          called, Mr. Confession. This man is noted for his open breastedness.
          He knows something of himself, and he tells all that he knows before
          the throne of God. Confession keeps back no secrets. Repentance sighs
          over the sin -- confession tells it out. Repentance feels the sin to
          be heavy within -- confession plucks it forth and indicts it before
          the throne of God. Repentance is the soul in travail -- confession
          delivers it. My heart is ready to burst, and there is a fire in my
          bones through repentance -- confession gives the heavenly fire a vent,
          and my soul flames upward before God. Repentance, alone, hath
          groanings which cannot be uttered -- confession is the voice which
          expresses the groans. Now then, hast thou made confession of thy sin
          -- not to man, but to God? If thou hast, then believe that thy
          repentance cometh from him, and it is a godly sorrow that needeth not
          to be repented of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holiness is evermore the bosom friend of penitence. Fair angel, clad
          in pure white linen, she loves good company and will never stay in a
          heart where repentance is a stranger. Repentance must dig the
          foundations, but holiness shall erect the structure, and bring forth
          the top-stone. Repentance is the clearing away of the rubbish of the
          past temple of sin; holiness builds the new temple which the Lord our
          God shall inherit. Repentance and desires after holiness never can be
          separated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet once more -- wherever repentance is, there cometh also with it,
          peace. As Jesus walked upon the waters of Galilee, and said, |Peace,
          be still,| so peace walks over the waters of repentance, and brings
          quiet and calm into the soul. If thou wouldst shake the thirst of thy
          soul, repentance must be the cup out of which thou shalt drink, and
          then sweet peace shall be the blessed effect. Sin is such a
          troublesome companion that it will always give thee the heartache till
          thou hast turned it out by repentance, and then thy heart shall rest
          and be still. Sin is the rough wind that tears through the forest, and
          sways every branch of the trees to and fro; but after penitence hath
          come into the soul the wind is hushed, and all is still, and the birds
          sing in the branches of the trees which just now creaked in the storm.
          Sweet peace repentance ever yields to the man who is the possessor of
          it. And now what sayest thou my hearer -- to put each point personally
          to thee -- hast thou had peace with God? If not, never rest till thou
          hast had it, and never believe thyself to be saved till thou feelest
          thyself to be reconciled. Be not content with the mere profession of
          the head, but ask that the peace of God which passeth all
          understanding, may keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now I come to my fourth and last point, namely, the
          EXCELLENCIES of repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall somewhat surprise you, perhaps, if I say that one of the
          excellencies of repentance lies in its pleasantness. |Oh|! you say,
          |but it is bitter|! Nay, say I, it is sweet. At least, it is bitter
          when it is alone, like the waters of Marah; but there is a tree called
          the cross, which if thou canst put into it, it will be sweet, and thou
          wilt love to drink of it. At a school of mutes who were both deaf and
          dumb, the teacher put the following question to her pupils: -- |What
          is the sweetest emotion|? As soon as the children comprehended the
          question, they took their slates and wrote their answers. One girl in
          a moment wrote down |Joy.| As soon as the teacher saw it, she expected
          that all would write the same, but another girl, more thoughtful, put
          her hand to her brow, and she wrote |Hope.| Verily, the girl was not
          far from the mark. But the next one, when she brought up her slate,
          had written |Gratitude,| and this child was not wrong. Another one,
          when she brought up her slate, had written |Love,| and I am sure she
          was right. But there was one other who had written in large
          characters, -- and as she brought up her slate the tear was in her
          eye, showing she had written what she felt, -- |Repentance is the
          sweetest emotion.| And I think she was right. Verily, in my own case,
          after that long drought, perhaps longer than Elisha's three years in
          which the heavens poured forth no rain, when I saw but one tear of
          penitence coming from my hard, hard soul -- it was such a joy! There
          have been times when you know you have done wrong, but when you could
          cry over it you have felt happy. As one weeps for his firstborn, so
          have you wept over your sin, and in that very weeping you have had
          your peace and your joy restored. I am a living witness that
          repentance is exceeding sweet when mixed with divine hope, but
          repentance without hope is hell. It is hell to grieve for sin with the
          pangs of bitter remorse, and yet to know that pardon can never come,
          and mercy never be vouchsafed. Repentance, with the cross before its
          eyes, is heaven itself; at least, if not heaven, it is so next door to
          it, that standing on the wet threshold I may see within the pearly
          portals, and sing the song of the angels who rejoice within.
          Repentance, then, has this excellency, that it is very sweet to the
          soul which is made to lie beneath its shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this excellency, it is specially sweet to God as well as to
          men. |A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.|
          When St. Augustine lay a-dying, he had this verse always fixed upon
          the curtains, so that as often as he awoke, he might read it -- |A
          broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.| When you
          despise yourselves, God honours you; but as long as you honour
          yourselves, God despises you. A whole heart is a scentless thing; but
          when it is broken and bruised, it is like that precious spice which
          was burned as holy incense in the ancient tabernacle. When the blood
          of Jesus is sprinkled on them, even the songs of the angels, and the
          vials full of odours sweet that smoke before the throne of the Most
          High, are not more agreeable to God than the sighs, and groans, and
          tears of the brokenhearted soul. So, then, if thou wouldest be
          pleasing with God, come before him with many and many a tear:
        </p>
        <p>|To humble souls and broken hearts</p>
        <p>God with his grace is ever nigh;</p>
        <p>Pardon and hope his love imparts,</p>
        <p>When men in deep contrition lie.</p>
        <p>He tells their tears, he counts their groans,</p>
        <p>His Son redeems their souls from death;</p>
        <p>His Spirit heals their broken bones,</p>
        <p>They in his praise employ their breath.|</p>
        <p>
          John Bunyan, in his |Siege of Mansoul,| when the defeated townsmen
          were seeking pardon, names Mr. Wet-eyes as the intercessor with the
          king. Mr. Wet-eyes -- good Saxon word! I hope we know Mr. Wet-eyes,
          and have had him many times in our house, for if he cannot intercede
          with God, yet Mr. Wet-eyes is a great friend with the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and Christ will undertake his case, and then we shall prevail.
          So have I set forth, then, some, but very few, of the excellencies of
          repentance. And now, my dear hearers, have you repented of Sin? Oh,
          impenitent soul, if thou dost not weep now, thou wilt have to weep for
          ever. The heart that is not broken now, must be broken for ever upon
          the wheel of divine vengeance. Thou must now repent, or else for ever
          smart for it. Turn or burn -- it is the Bible's only alternative. If
          thou repentest, the gate of mercy stands wide open. Only the Spirit of
          God bring thee on thy knees in self-abasement, for Christ's cross
          stands before thee, and he who bled upon it bids thee look at him. Oh,
          sinner, obey the divine bidding. But, if your heart be hard, like that
          of the stubborn Jews in the days of Moses, take heed, lest, --
        </p>
        <p>|The Lord in vengeance dressed,</p>
        <p>Shall lift his head and swear, --</p>
        <p>You that despised my promised rest,</p>
        <p>Shall have no portion there.|</p>
        <p>
          At any rate, sinner, if thou wilt not repent, there is one here who
          will, and that is myself. I repent that I could not preach to you with
          more earnestness this morning, and throw my whole soul more thoroughly
          into my pleading with you. the Lord God, whom I serve, is my constant
          witness that there is nothing I desire so much as to see your hearts
          broken on account of sin; and nothing has gladdened my heart so much
          as the many instances lately vouchsafed of the wonders God is doing in
          this place. There have been men who have stepped into this Hall, who
          had never entered a place of worship for a score years, and here the
          Lord has met with them, and I believe, if I could speak the word,
          there are hundreds who would stand up now, and say, |Twas here the
          Lord met with me. I was the chief of sinners; the hammer struck my
          heart and broke it, and now it has been bound up again by the finger
          of divine mercy, and I tell it unto sinners, and tell it to this
          assembled congregation, there have been depths of mercy found that
          have been deeper than the depths of my iniquity.| This day there will
          be a soul delivered; this morning there will be, I do not doubt,
          despite my weakness, a display of the energy of God, and the power of
          the Spirit; some drunkard shall be turned from the error of his ways;
          some soul, who was trembling on the very jaws of hell, shall look to
          him who is the sinner's hope, and find peace and pardon -- ay, at this
          very hour. So be it, O Lord, and thine shall be the glory, world
          without end.
