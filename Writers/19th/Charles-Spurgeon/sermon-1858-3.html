        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.167)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 13, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>

          |These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
          Spirit.| -- Jude 1:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN a farmer comes to thrash out his wheat, and get it ready for the
          market there are two things that he desires -- that there may be
          plenty of it, of the right sort, and that when he takes it to market,
          he may be able to carry a clean sample there. He does not look upon
          the quantity alone; for what is the chaff to the wheat? He would
          rather have a little clean than he would have a great heap containing
          a vast quantity of chaff, but less of the precious corn. On the other
          hand, he would not so winnow his wheat as to drive away any of the
          good grain, and so make the quantity less than it need to be. He wants
          to have as much as possible -- to have as little loss as possible in
          the winnowing, and yet to have it as well winnowed as may be. Now,
          that is what I desire for Christ's Church, and what every Christian
          will desire. We wish Christ's church to be as large as possible. God
          forbid that by any of our winnowing, we should ever cast away one of
          the precious sons of Zion. When we rebuke sharply, we would be anxious
          lest the rebuke should fall where it is not needed, and should bruise
          and hurt the feelings of any who God hath chosen. But on the other
          hand, we have no wish to see the church multiplied at the expense of
          its purity. We do not wish to have a charity so large that it takes in
          chaff as well as wheat: we wish to be just charitable enough to use
          the fan thoroughly to purge God's floor, but yet charitable enough to
          pick up the most shrivelled ear of wheat, to preserve it for the
          Master's sake, who is the husbandman. I trust, in preaching this
          morning, God may help me so to discern between the precious and the
          vile that I may say nothing uncharitable, which would cut off any of
          God's people from being part of his true and living and visible
          church; and yet at the same time I pray that I may not speak so
          loosely, and so without God's direction, as to embrace any in the arms
          of Christian affection whom the Lord hath not received in the eternal
          covenant of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text suggests to us three things: first, an inquiry -- Have we the
          Spirit? secondly, a caution -- if we have not the spirit we are
          sensual; thirdly, a suspicion -- there are many persons that separate
          themselves. Our suspicion concerning them is, that notwithstanding
          their extra-superfine profession, they are sensual, not having the
          Spirit; for our text says, |These be they who separate themselves,
          sensual, having not the Spirit.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, our text suggests AN INQUIRY -- Have we the Spirit?
          This is an inquiry so important, that the philosopher may well suspend
          all his investigations to find an answer to this question on his own
          personal account. All the great debates of politics, all the most
          engrossing subjects of human discussion, may well stop to-day, and
          give us pause to ask ourselves the solemn question -- |Have I the
          Spirit?| For this question does not deal with any externals of
          religion, but it deals with religion in its most vital point. He that
          hath the Spirit, although he be wrong in fifty things, being right in
          this, is saved; he that hath not the Spirit, be he never so orthodox,
          be his creed as correct as Scripture-ay and in his morals outwardly as
          pure as the law, is still unsaved; he is destitute of the essential
          part of salvation -- the Spirit of God dwelling in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help us to answer this question, I shall try to set forth the
          effects of the Spirit in our hearts under sundry Scriptural metaphors.
          Have I the Spirit? I reply, And what is the operation of the, Spirit?
          How am I to discern it? Now the Spirit operates in divers ways, all of
          them mysterious, and supernatural, all of them bearing the real marks
          of his own power, and having certain signs following whereby they may
          be discovered and recognised.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first work of the Spirit in the heart is a work during which
          the Spirit is compared to the wind. You remember that when our Saviour
          spoke to Nicodemus he represented the first work of the Spirit in the
          heart as being like the wind, |which bloweth where it listeth;| |even
          so;| saith he, |is every one that is born of the Spirit.| Now you know
          that the wind is a most mysterious thing; and although there be
          certain definitions of it which pretend to be explanations of the
          phenomenon, yet they certainly leave the great question of how the
          wind blows, and what is the cause of its blowing in a certain
          direction, where it was before. Breath within us, wind without us, all
          motions of air, are to us mysterious. And the renewing work of the
          Spirit in the heart is exceedingly mysterious. It is possible that at
          this moment the Spirit of God may be breathing into some of the
          thousand hearts before me; yet it would be blasphemous if any one
          should ask, |Which way went the Spirit from God to such a heart? How
          entered it there?| And it would be foolish for a person who is under
          the operation of the Spirit to ask how it operates: thou knowest not
          where is the storehouse of the thunder; thou knowest not where the
          clouds are balanced; neither canst thou know how the Spirit goeth
          forth from the Most High and enters into the heart of man. It may be,
          that during a sermon two men are listening to the same truth; one of
          them hears as attentively as the other and remembers as much of it;
          the other is melted to tears or moved with solemn thoughts; but the
          one though equally attentive, sees nothing in the sermon, except,
          maybe, certain important truths well set forth; as for the other, his
          heart is broken within him and his soul is melted. Ask me how it is
          that the same truth has an effect upon the one, and not upon his
          fellow: I reply, because the mysterious Spirit of the living God goes
          with the truth to one heart and not to the other. The one only feels
          the force of truth, and that may be strong enough to make him tremble,
          like Felix; but the other feels the Spirit going with the truth, and
          that renews the man, regenerates him, and causes him to pass into that
          gracious condition which is called the state of salvation. This change
          takes place instantaneously. It is as miraculous a change as any
          miracle of which we read in Scripture. It is supremely supernatural.
          It may be mimicked, but no imitation of it can be true and real. Men
          may pretend to be regenerated without the Spirit, but regenerated they
          cannot be. It is a change so marvellous that the highest attempts of
          man can never reach it. We may reason as long as we please, but we
          cannot reason ourselves into regeneration; we may meditate till our
          hairs are grey with study; but we cannot meditate ourselves into the
          new birth. That is worked in us by the sovereign will of God alone.
        </p>
        <p>|The Spirit, like some heavenly wind,</p>
        <p>Blows on the sons of flesh,</p>
        <p>Inspires us with a heavenly mind,</p>
        <p>And forms the man afresh.|</p>
        <p>
          But ask the man how: he cannot tell you. Ask him when: he may
          recognize the time, but as to the manner thereof he knoweth no more of
          it than you do. It is to him a mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          You remember the story of the valley of vision. Ezekiel saw dry bones
          lying scattered here and there in the valley. The command came to
          Ezekiel, |Say to:these dry bones, live.| He said, |Live,| and the
          bones came together, |bone to his bone, and flesh came upon them;| but
          as yet they did not live. |Prophesy, son of man; say to the wind,
          breathe upon these slain, that they may live.| They looked just like
          life: there was flesh and blood there; there were the eyes and hands
          and feet; but when Ezekiel had spoken there was a mysterious something
          given which men call life, and it was given in a mysterious way, like
          the blowing of the wind. It is even so to-day. Unconverted and ungodly
          persons may be very, moral and excellent; they are like the dry bones,
          when they are put together and clothed with flesh and blood. But to
          make them live spiritually it needs the divine afflatus from the
          breath of the Almighty, the divine pneuma, the divine Spirit, the
          divine wind should blow on them, and then they would live. Say, my
          hearer, hast thou ever had any supernatural influence on thine Heart?
          For if not I may seem to be harsh with thee, but I am faithful: if
          thou hast never had more than nature in thy heart, thou art |in the
          gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity.| Nay, sir, sneer not
          at that utterance; it is as true as this Bible, for tis from this
          Bible it was taken, and for proof thereof hear thou me. |except a man
          be born again (from above) of water and of the Spirit, he cannot see
          the kingdom of God.| What sayest thou to that? It is in vain for thee
          to talk of making thyself to be born again; thou canst not be born
          again except by the Spirit, and thou must perish, unless thou art. You
          see, then, the first effect of the Spirit, and by that you may answer
          the question.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the next place, the Spirit in the word of God is often compared
          to fire. After the Spirit, like the wind, has made the dead sinner
          live, then comes the Spirit like fire. Now, fire has a searching and
          tormenting power. It is purifying, but it purifies by a terrible
          process. Now, after the Holy Spirit has given us the life of
          Christianity, there immediately begins a burning in our heart: the
          Lord searches and tries our reins, and lights a candle within our
          spirits which discovers the wickedness of our nature, and the
          loathsomeness of our iniquities. Say, my hearer, dost thou know
          anything about that fire in thine heart? For if not, thou hast not yet
          received the Spirit. To explain what I mean, let me just tell a piece
          of my own experience, by way of illustrating the fiery effects of the
          Spirit. I lived careless and thoughtless; I could indulge in sin as
          well as others, and did do so. Sometimes my conscience pricked me, but
          not enough to make me cease from vice. I could indulge in
          transgression, and I could love it: not so much as others loved it --
          mine early training would not let me do that -- but still enough to
          prove that my heart was debased and corrupt. Once on a time something
          more than conscience pricked me: I knew not then what it was. I was
          like Samuel, when the Lord called him; I heard the voice, but I knew
          not whence it came. A stirring began in my heart, and I began to feel
          that in the sight of God I was a lost, ruined, and condemned sinner.
          That conviction I could not shake off. Do what I might it followed me.
          If I sought to amuse my mind and take it off from serious thoughts it
          was of no use; I was obliged still to carry about with me a heavy
          burden on my back. I went to my bed, and there I dreamed about hell,
          and about |the wrath to come.| I woke up, and this dreary nightmare,
          this incubus, still brooded on me. What could I do? I renounced first
          one vicious habit, then another: it mattered not; all this was like
          pulling one firebrand from a flame, that fed itself with blazing
          forests. Do what I might, my conscience found no rest. Up to the house
          of God I went to hear the gospel: there was no gospel for me; the fire
          burned but the more fiercely, and the very breath of the gospel seemed
          to fan the flame. Away I went to my chamber and my closet to pray: the
          heavens were like brass, and the windows of the sky were barred
          against me. No answer could I get; the fire burned more vehemently.
          Then I thought, |I would not live always; would God I had never been
          born!| But I dared not die, for there was hell when I was dead; and I
          dared not live, for life had become intolerable. Still the fire blazed
          right vehemently; till at last I came to this resolve: |If there be
          salvation in Christ, I will have it. I have nothing of my own to trust
          to; I do this hour, O God, renounce my sin, and renounce my own
          righteousness too.| And the fire blazed again, and burned up all my
          good works, ay, and my sins with them. And then I saw that all this
          burning was to bring me to Christ. And oh! the joy and gladness of my
          heart, when Jesus came and sprinkled water on the flame, and said, |I
          have bought thee with my blood; put thy trust in me; I will do for
          thee what thou canst not do for thyself; I will take thy sins away; I
          will clothe thee with a spotless robe of righteousness; I will guide
          thee all thy journey through, and land thee at last in heaven.| Say,
          my dear hearer, Dost know anything about the Spirit of burning? For if
          not, again I say, I am not harsh, I am but true; if thou hast never
          felt this, thou knowest not the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To proceed a little further. When the Spirit has thus quickened the
          soul and convinced it of sin, then he comes under another metaphor. He
          comes under the metaphor of oil. The Holy Spirit is very frequently in
          Scripture compared to oil. |Thou anointest mine head with oil; my cup
          runneth over.| Ah! brethren, though the beginning of the Spirit is by
          fire, it does not end there. We may be first of all convinced and
          brought to Christ by misery; but when we get to Christ there is no
          misery in him, and our sorrow results from not getting close enough to
          him. The Holy Spirit comes, like the good Samaritan, and pours in the
          oil and the wine. And oh! what oil it is with which he anoints our
          head, and with which he heals our wounds! How soft the liniments which
          he binds round our bruises! How blessed the eye-salve with which he
          anoints our eyes! How heavenly the ointment with which he binds up our
          sores, and wounds, and bruises, and makes us whole, and sets our feet
          upon a rock, and establishes our goings! The Spirit, after he has
          convinced, begins to comfort; and ye that have felt the comforting
          power of the Holy Spirit, will bear me witness there is no comforter
          like him that is the Paraclete. Oh! bring hither the music, the voice
          of song, and the sound of harps; they are both as vinegar upon nitre
          to him that hath a heavy heart. Bring me here the enchantments of the
          magic world, and all the enjoyments of its pleasures; they do but
          torment the soul and prick it with many thorns. But oh! Spirit of the
          living God, when thou dost blow upon the heart, there is not a wave of
          that tempestuous sea which does not sleep for ever when thou biddest
          it be still; there is not one single breath of the proud hurricane and
          tempest which doth not cease to howl and which doth not lie still,
          when thou sayest to it, |Peace be unto thee; thy sins are forgiven
          thee.| Say, do you know the Spirit under the figure of oil? Have you
          felt him at work in your spirits, comforting you, anointing your head,
          making you glad, and causing you to rejoice?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many people that never felt this. They hope they are
          religious; but their religion never makes them happy. There are scores
          of professors who have just enough religion to make them miserable.
          Let them be afraid that they have any religion at all; for religion
          makes people happy; when it has its full sway with man it makes him
          glad. It may begin in agony, but it does not end there. Say, hast thou
          ever had thine heart leaping for joy? Hath thy lip ever warbled songs
          of ecstatic praise? Doth thine eye ever flash the fire of joy? If
          these things be not so, I fear lest thou art still without God, and
          without Christ; for where the Spirit comes, his fruits are, joy in the
          Spirit, and peace, and love, and confidence, and assurance for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Bear with me once more. I have to show you one more figure of the
          Spirit, and by that also you will be able to ascertain whether you are
          under his operation. When the Spirit has acted as wind, as fire, and
          as oil, he then acts like water. We are told that we are |born again
          of water and of the Spirit.| Now I do not think you foolish enough to
          need that I should say that no water, either of immersion or of
          sprinkling, can in the least degree operate in the salvation of a
          soul. There may be some few poor creatures, whose heads were put on
          their shoulders the wrong way, who still believe that a few drops of
          water from a priest's hands can regenerate souls. There may be such a
          few, but I hope the race will soon die out. We trust that the day will
          come when all those gentry will have no |other Gospel| to preach in
          our churches, but will have clean gone over to Rome, and when that
          terrible plague-spot upon the Protestant Church, called Puseyism, will
          have been cut out like a cancer, and torn out by its very roots. The
          sooner we get rid of that the better; and whenever we hear of any of
          them going over to Rome, let them go -- I wish we could as easily get
          rid of the devil, they may go together -- we do not want either of
          them in the Protestant Church, anyhow. But the Holy Spirit when he
          comes in the heart comes like water. That is to say, he comes to
          purify the soul. He that is to-day as foul a liver as he was before
          his pretended conversion is a hypocrite and a liar; he that this day
          loveth sin and liveth in it just as he was wont to do, let him know
          that the truth is not in him, but he hath received the strong delusion
          to believe a lie: God's people are a holy people; God's Spirit works
          by love, and purifies the soul. Once let it get into our hearts, and
          it will have no rest till it has turned every sin out. God's Holy
          Spirit and man's sin cannot live together peaceably; they may both be
          in the same heart, but they cannot both reign there, nor can they both
          be quiet there; for |the Spirit lusteth against the flesh, and the
          flesh lusteth against the Spirit;| they cannot rest, but there will be
          a perpetual warring in the soul, so that the Christian will have to
          cry, |O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
          this death?| But in due time the Spirit will drive out all sin, and
          will present us blameless before the throne of his Majesty with
          exceeding great joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my hearer, answer thou this question for thyself, and not for
          another man. Hast thou received this Spirit? Answer me, anyhow; if it
          be with a scoff, answer me; if thou sneerest and sayest, |I know
          nothing of your enthusiastic rant,| be it so, sir; say, nay, then. It
          may be thou carest not to reply at all. I beseech thee do not put away
          my entreaty. Yes or no. Hast thou received the Spirit? |Sir no man can
          find fault with my character; I believe I shall enter heaven through
          my own virtues.| It is not the question, sir. Hast thou received the
          Spirit? All that thou sayest thou mayest have done; but if thou hast
          left the other undone, and hast not received the Spirit, it will go
          ill with thee at last. Hast thou had a supernatural operation upon
          thine own heart? Hast thou been made a new man in Christ Jesus! For if
          not, depend on it, as God's Word is true, thou art out of Christ, and
          dying as thou art thou wilt be shut out of heaven, be thou who thou
          mayest and what thou mayest.

          II. Thus, I have tried to help you to answer the first question -- the
          inquiry, Have we received the Spirit? And this brings me to the
          CAUTION. He that has not received the Spirit is said to be sensual.
          Oh, what a gulf there is between the least Christian and the greatest
          moralist! What a wide distinction there is between the greatest
          professor destitute of grace, and the least of God's believers who has
          grace in his heart. As great a difference as there is between light
          and darkness between death and life, between heaven and hell, is there
          between a saint and a sinner; for mark, my text says, in no very
          polite phrase, that if we have not the Spirit we are sensual. |
          Sensual!| says one; |well, I am not converted man -- I don t pretend
          to be; but I am not sensual.| Well, friend, and it is very likely that
          you are not -- not in the common acceptation of the term sensual; but
          understand that this word, in the Greek, really means what an English
          word like this would mean, if we had such a one -- soulish. We have
          not such a word -- we want such a one. There is a great distinction
          between mere animals and men, because man hath a soul, and the mere
          animal hath none. There is another distinction between mere men and a
          converted man. The converted man hath the Spirit -- the unconverted
          man hath none; he is a soulish man -- not a spiritual man; he has got
          no further than mere nature and has no inheritance in the spiritual
          kingdom of grace. Strange it is that soulish and sensual should after
          all mean the same! Friend, thou hast not the Spirit. Then thou art
          nothing better -- be thou what thou art, or whatsoever thou mayest be
          -- than the fall of Adam left thee. That is to say, thou art a fallen
          creature, having only capacities to live here in sin, and to live for
          ever in torment; but thou hast not the capacity to live in heaven at
          all, for thou hast no Spirit; and therefore thou art unable to know or
          enjoy spiritual things. And mark you, a man may be in this state, and
          be a sensual man, and yet he may have all the virtues that could grace
          a Christian; but with all these, if he has not the Spirit, he has got
          not an inch further than where Adam's fall left him -- that is,
          condemned and under the curse. Ay, and he may attend to religion with
          all his might -- he may take the sacrament, and be baptized, and may
          be the most devout professor; but if he hath not the Spirit he hath
          not started a solitary inch from where he was, for he is still in |the
          bonds of iniquity,| a lost soul. Nay, further, he may pick up
          religious phrases till he may talk very fast about religion; he may
          read biographies till he seems to be a deep taught child of God; he
          may be able to write an article upon the deep experience of a
          believer; but if this experience be not his own, if he hath not
          received it by the Spirit of the living God, he is still nothing more
          than a carnal man, and heaven is to him a place to which there is no
          entrance. Nay, further, he might go so far as to become a minister of
          the gospel, and a successful minister too, and God may bless the word
          that he preaches to the salvation of sinners, but unless he has
          received the Spirit, be he as eloquent as Apollos, and as earnest as
          Paul, he is nothing more than a mere soulish man, without capacity for
          spiritual things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nay, to crown all, he might even have the power of working miracles,
          as Judas had -- he might even be received into the church as a
          believer, as was Simon Magus, and after all that, though he had cast
          out devils, though he had healed the sick, though he had worked
          miracles, he might have the gates of heaven shut in his teeth, if he
          had not received the Spirit. For this is the essential thing, without
          which all others are in vain -- the reception of the Spirit of the
          living God. It is a searching truth, is it not, my friends? Do not run
          away from it. If I am preaching to you falsehood, reject it; but if
          this be a truth which I can substantiate by Scripture, I beseech you,
          rest not till you have answered this question: Hast thou the Spirit,
          living, dwelling, working in thy heart?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This brings me, in the third place, to THE SUSPICION. How
          singular that |separation| should be the opposite of having the
          Spirit. Hark! I hear a gentle man saying, |Oh! I like to hear you
          preach smartly and sharply; I am persuaded, sir, there are a great
          many people in the church that ought not to be there; and so I,
          because there is such a corrupt mixture in the church, have determined
          not to join anywhere at all. I do not think that the Church of Christ
          now a days is at all clean and pure enough to allow of my joining with
          it. At least, sir, I did join a church once, but I made such a deal of
          noise in it they were very glad when I went away. And now I am just
          like David's men; I am one that is in debt and discontented, and I go
          round to hear all new preachers that arise. I have heard you now these
          three months; I mean to go and hear some one else in a very little
          time if you do not say something to flatter me. But I am quite sure I
          am one of God's special elect. I don't join any church because a
          church is not good enough for me; I don't become a member of any
          denomination, because they are all wrong, every one of them.| Hark ye
          brother, I have something to tell you, that will not please you.
          |These be they that separate themselves, sensual, having not the
          Spirit.| I hope you enjoy the text: it certainly belongs to you, above
          every man in the world. |These be they who separate themselves,
          sensual, having not the Spirit.| When I read this over I thought to
          myself, there be some who say, |Well, you are a dissenter, how do you
          make this agreeable with the text, These be they who separate
          themselves;' | you are separated from the Church of England. Ah, my
          friends, that a man may be, and be all the better for it; but the
          separation here intended is separation from the one universal Church
          of Christ. The Church of England was not known in Jude's day: so the
          apostle did not allude to that. |These be they who separate
          themselves,| -- that is from the Church of Christ; from the great
          universal body of the elect. Moreover, let us just say one thing. We
          did not separate ourselves -- we were turned out. Dissenters did not
          separate themselves from the Church of England, from the Episcopal
          church; but when the Act of Uniformity was passed, they were turned
          out of their pulpits. Our forefathers were as sound Churchmen as any
          in the world, but they could not take in all the errors of the Prayer
          Book, and they were therefore hounded to their graves by the
          intolerance of the conforming professors. So they did not separate
          themselves. Moreover, we do not separate ourselves. There is not a
          Christian beneath the scope of God's heaven from whom I am separated.
          At the Lord's table I always invite all Churches to come and sit down
          and commune with us. If any man were to tell me that I am separate
          from the Episcopalian, the Presbyterian, or the Methodist, I would
          tell him he did not know me, for I love them with a pure heart
          fervently, and I am not separate from them. I may hold different views
          from them, and in that point truly I may be said to be separate; but I
          am not separate in heart, I will work with them -- I will work with
          them heartily; nay, though my Church of England brother sends me in,
          as he has done, a summons to pay a churchrate that I cannot in
          conscience pay, I will love him still; and if he takes chairs and
          tables it matters not -- I will love him for all that; and if there be
          a ragged-school or anything else for which I can work with him to
          promote the glory of God, therein will I unite with him with all my
          heart. I think this bears rather hard on our friends -- the Strict
          Communion Baptists. I should not like to say anything hard against
          them, for they are about the best people in the world, but they really
          do separate themselves from the great body of Christ's people. The
          Spirit of the living God will not let them do this really, but they do
          it professedly. They separate themselves from the great Universal
          Church. They say they will not commune with it; and if any one comes
          to their table who has not been baptized, they turn him away. They
          |separate,| certainly. I do not believe it is willful schism that
          makes them thus act; but at the same time I think the old man within
          has some hand in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, how my heart loves the doctrine of the one church. The nearer I
          get to my Master in prayer and communion, the closer am I knit to all
          his disciples. The more I see of my own errors and failings, the more
          ready am I to deal gently with them that I believe to be erring. The
          pulse of Christ's body is communion; and woe to the church that seeks
          to cure the ills of Christ's body by stopping its pulse. I think it
          sin to refuse to commune with anyone who is a member of the Church of
          our Lord Jesus Christ. I desire this morning to preach the unity of
          Christ's church. I have sought to use the fan to blow away the chaff.
          I have said no man belongs to Christ's church unless he has the
          Spirit; but, if he hath the Spirit, woe be to the man that separates
          himself from him. Oh! I should think myself grossly in fault if at the
          foot of these stairs I should meet a truly converted child of God, who
          called himself a Primitive Methodist, or a Wesleyan. or a Churchman,
          or an Independent, and I should say, |No, sir, you do not agree with
          me on certain points; I believe you are a child of God, but I will
          have nothing to do with you.| I should then think that this text would
          bear very hard on me. |These be they who separate themselves, sensual,
          having not the Spirit.| But would we do so, beloved? No, we would give
          them both our hands, and say, God speed to you in your journey to
          heaven; so long as you have got the Spirit we are one family, and we
          will not be separate from one another. God grant the day may come when
          every wall of separation shall be beaten down! See how to this day we
          are separate. There! you will find a Baptist who could not say a good
          word to a Poedo-Baptist if you were to give him a world. You find to
          this day Episcopalians who hate that ugly word, |Dissent;| and it is
          enough for them that a Dissenter has done a thing; they will not do it
          then, be it never so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! and furthermore, there are some to be found in the Church of
          England that will not only hate dissent, but hate one another into the
          bargain. Men are to be found that cannot let brother ministers of
          their own church preach in their parish. What an anachronism such men
          are! They would seem to have been sent into the world in our time
          purely by mistake. Their proper era would have been the time of the
          dark ages. If they had lived then, what fine Bonners they would have
          made! What splendid fellows they would have been to have helped to
          poke the fire in Smithfield! But they are quite out of date in these
          times, and I look upon such a curious clergyman in the same way that I
          do upon a Dodo -- as an extraordinary animal whose race is almost, if
          not quite extinct. Well, you may look, and look and wonder. The animal
          will be extinct soon. It will not be long, I trust, before not only
          the Church of England shall love itself, but when all who love the
          Lord Jesus shall be ready to preach in each other's pulpits, preaching
          the same truth, holding the same faith, and mightily contending for
          it. Then shall the world |see how these Christians love one another; |
          and then shall it be known in heaven that Christ s kingdom has come,
          and that his will is about to be done on earth as it is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hearer, dost thou belong to the church? For out of the church there
          is no salvation. But mark what the church is. It is not the
          Episcopalian, Baptist, or Presbyterian: the church is a company of men
          who have received the Spirit. If thou canst not say thou hast the
          Spirit, go thy way and tremble; go thy way and think of thy lost
          condition; and may Jesus by his Spirit so bless thee, that thou mayest
          be led to renounce thy works and ways with grief, and fly to him who
          died upon the cross, and find a shelter there from the wrath of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may have said some rough things this morning, but I am not given
          much to cutting and trimming, and I do not suppose I shall begin to
          learn that art now. If the thing is untrue, it is with you to reject
          it; if it be true, at your own peril reject what God stamps with
          divine authority. May the blessing of the Father, the Son, and the
          Holy Spirit rest upon the one church of Israel's one Jehovah. Amen and
          Amen.
