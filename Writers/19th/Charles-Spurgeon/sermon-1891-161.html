          1. Thus then does the Lord plainly show that it was the true Lord and
          the one God who had been set forth by the law; for Him whom the law
          proclaimed as God, the same did Christ point out as the Father, whom
          also it behoves the disciples of Christ alone to serve. By means of
          the statements of the law, He put our adversary to utter confusion;
          and the law directs us to praise God the Creator (Demiurgum), and to
          serve Him alone. Since this is the case, we must not seek for another
          Father besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God who justifies
          the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. For
          if there were any other perfect Father above Him, He (Christ) would by
          no means have overthrown Satan by means of His words and commandments.
          For one ignorance cannot be done away with by means of another
          ignorance, any more than one defect by another defect. If, therefore,
          the law is due to ignorance and defect, how could the statements
          contained therein bring to nought the ignorance of the devil, and
          conquer the strong man? For a strong man can be conquered neither by
          an inferior nor by an equal, but by one possessed of greater power.
          But the Word of God is the superior above all, He who is loudly
          proclaimed in the law: |Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God;|
          and, |Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;| and, |Him
          shall thou adore, and Him alone shall thou serve.| Then in the Gospel,
          casting down the apostasy by means of these expressions, He did both
          overcome the strong man by His Father's voice, and He acknowledges the
          commandment of the law to express His own sentiments, when He says,
          |Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.| For He did not confound the
          adversary by the saying of any other, but by that belonging to His own
          Father, and thus overcame the strong man.

          2. He taught by His commandment that we who have been set free should,
          when hungry, take that food which is given by God; and that, when
          placed in the exalted position of every grace [that can be received],
          we should not, either by trusting to works of righteousness, or when
          adorned with super-eminent [gifts of] ministration, by any means be
          lifted up with pride, nor should we tempt God, but should feel
          humility in all things, and have ready to hand [this saying], |Thou
          shall not tempt the Lord thy God.| As also the apostle taught, saying,
          |Minding not high things, but consenting to things of low estate;|
          that we should neither be ensnared with riches, nor mundane glory, nor
          present fancy, but should know that we must |worship the Lord thy God,
          and serve Him alone,| and give no heed to him who falsely promised
          things not his own, when he said, |All these will I give thee, if,
          falling down, thou wilt worship me.| For he himself confesses that to
          adore him, and to do his will, is to fall from the glory of God. And
          in what thing either pleasant or good can that man who has fallen
          participate? Or what else can such a person hope for or expect, except
          death? For death is next neighbour to him who has fallen. Hence also
          it follows that he will not give what he has promised. For how can he
          make grants to him who has fallen? Moreover, since God rules over men
          and him too, and without the will of our Father in heaven not even a
          sparrow falls to the ground, it follows that his declaration, |All
          these things are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give
          them,| proceeds from him when puffed up with pride. For the creation
          is not subjected to his power, since indeed he is himself but one
          among created things. Nor shall he give away the rule over men to men;
          but both all other things, and all human affairs, are arranged
          according to God the Father's disposal. Besides, the Lord declares
          that |the devil is a liar from the beginning, and the truth is not in
          him.| If then he be a liar and the truth be not in him, he certainly
          did not speak truth, but a lie, when he said, |For all these things
          are delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will I give them.|
