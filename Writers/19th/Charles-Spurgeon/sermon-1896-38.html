          3. For my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burnt up as a
          hearth. 4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass, because I
          have forgotten to eat my bread.5. By reason of the voice of my
          groaning, my bones cleave to my flesh. 6. I have become like a pelican
          of the wilderness; I have become like an owl of the deserts.7. I have
          watched, and have been like a sparrow which is alone upon the
          house-top.

          3 For my days are consumed like smoke These expressions are
          hyperbolical, but still they show how deeply the desolation of the
          Church ought to wound the hearts of the people of God. Let every man,
          therefore, carefully examine himself on this head. If we do not prefer
          the Church to all the other objects of our solicitude, we are unworthy
          of being accounted among her members. Whenever we meet with such forms
          of expression as these, let us remember that they reproach our
          slothfulness in not being affected with the afflictions of the Church
          as we ought. The Psalmist compares his days to smoke, and his bones to
          the stones of the hearth, which, in the course of time, are consumed
          by the fire. By bones he means the strength of man. And, were not men
          devoid of feeling, such a melancholy spectacle of the wrath of God
          would assuredly have the effect of drying up their bones, and wasting
          away their whole rigor.

          4 My heart is smitten, and dried up like grass Here he employs a third
          similitude, declaring that his heart is withered, and wholly dried up
          like mown grass. But he intends to express something more than that
          his heart was withered, and his bones reduced to a state of dryness.
          His language implies, that as the grass, when it is cut down, can no
          longer receive juice from the earth, nor retain the life and rigor
          which it derived from the root, so his heart being, as it were, torn
          and cut off from its root, was deprived of its natural nourishment.
          The meaning of the last clause, I have forgotten to eat my bread, is,
          My sorrow has been so great, that I have neglected my ordinary food.
          The Jews, it is true, during their captivity in Babylon, did eat their
          food; and it would have been an evidence of their having fallen into
          sinful despair, had they starved themselves to death. But what he
          means to say is, that he was so afflicted with sorrow as to refuse all
          delights, and to deprive himself even of food and drink. True
          believers may cease for a time to partake of their ordinary food,
          when, by voluntary fasting, they humbly beseech God to turn away his
          wrath, but the prophet does not here speak of that kind of abstinence
          from bodily sustenance. He speaks of such as is the effect of extreme
          mental distress, which is accompanied with a loathing of food, and a
          weariness of all things. In the close of the verse, he adds, that his
          body was, as it were, consuming or wasting away, so that his bones
          clave to his skin.

          6 I have become like a pelican of the wilderness Instead of rendering
          the original word by pelican, some translate it bittern, and others
          the cuckoo. The Hebrew word here used for owl is rendered by the
          Septuagint nuktikorax, which signifies a bat. But as even the Jews are
          doubtful as to the kind of birds here intended, let it suffice us
          simply to know, that in this verse there are pointed out certain
          melancholy birds, whose place of abode is in the holes of mountains
          and in deserts, and whose note, instead of being delightful and sweet
          to the ear, inspires those who hear it with terror. I am removed, as
          if he had said, from the society of men, and am become almost like a
          wild beast of the forest. Although the people of God dwelt in a well
          cultivated and fertile region, yet the whole country of Chaldea and
          Assyria was to them like a wilderness, since their hearts were bound
          by the strongest ties of affection to the temple, and to their native
          country from which they had been expelled. The third similitude, which
          is taken from the sparrow, denotes such grief as produces the greatest
          uneasiness. The word tsphvr, tsippor, signifies in general any kind of
          bird; but I have no doubt that it is here to be understood of the
          sparrow. It is described as solitary or alone, because it has been
          bereaved of its mate; and so deeply affected are these little birds
          when separated from their mates, that their distress exceeds almost
          all sorrow. <br />
