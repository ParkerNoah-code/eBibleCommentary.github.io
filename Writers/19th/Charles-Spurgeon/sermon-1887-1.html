        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1990)</p>

        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to
          Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. The Lord thy God in the midst of
          thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he
          will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. I will
          gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of
          thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.| -- Zephaniah 3:16-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOLY SCRIPTURE is wonderfully full and abiding in its inner sense. It
          is a springing well, whereat you may draw, and draw again; for as you
          draw, it springs up for ever new and fresh. It is a well of water
          springing up everlastingly. The fulfillment of a divine promise is not
          the exhaustion of it. When a man gives you a promise, and he keeps it,
          there is an end of the promise; but it is not so with God. When he
          keeps his word to the full, he has but begun: he is prepared to keep
          it, and keep it, and keep it for ever and ever. What would you say of
          a man who had wheat upon his barn floor, and threshed it until he had
          beaten out the last golden grain; but the next day he went and
          threshed again, and brought back as much as the day before; and on the
          day after, again taking his flail, he went to the same threshing, and
          again brought back his measure as full as at the first, and so on for
          all the days of the year? Would it not seem to you as a fairy tale? It
          would certainly be a surprising miracle. But what should we say if,
          throughout a long life, this miracle could be prolonged.? Yet we have
          continued to thresh the promises ever since faith was given us, and we
          have carried away our full portion every day. What shall we say of the
          glorious fact that the saints in all generations, from the first day
          until now, have done the same; and of that equal truth, that as long
          as there is a needy soul upon earth, there will be upon the threshing
          floor of the promises the same abundance of the finest of the wheat as
          when the first man filled his measure and returned rejoicing? I will
          not dwell upon the specific application of the text before us: I do
          not doubt that it was specially fulfilled as it was intended; and if
          there still remains some special piece of history to which this
          passage alludes, it will again be fulfilled in due time; but this I
          know, that those who have lived between whiles have found this promise
          true to them. Children of God have used these promises under all sorts
          of circumstances, and have derived the utmost comfort from them; and
          this morning I feel as if the text had been newly written for the
          present occasion, for it is in every syllable most suitable to the
          immediate crisis. If the Lord had fixed his eye upon the condition of
          his church just now, and had written this passage only for this year
          of grace 1887, it could scarcely have been more adapted to the
          occasion. Our business shall be to show this; but I would aim at much
          more. Let our prayer be that we, may enjoy this marvellous portion of
          the sacred word, and take intense delight in it. As God rests in his
          love, so may we rest in it this morning; and as he joys over us with
          singing, so may we break forth into joyous psalms to the God of our
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going to begin with the last verse of the text, and work my way
          upwards. The first; head is, a trying day for God's people. They are
          sorrowful because a cloud is upon their solemn assembly, and the
          reproach thereof is a burden. Secondly, we will note a glorious ground
          of consolation. We read in the seventeenth verse, |The Lord thy God in
          the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee
          with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
          singing.| And, thirdly, here is a brave conduct suggested thereby: |In
          that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion,
          Let not thine hands be slack.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Beginning at the eighteenth verse, we notice A TRYING DAY FOR GOD'S
          PEOPLE. The solemn assembly had fallen under reproach. The solemn
          assemblies of Israel were her glory: her great days of festival and
          sacrifice were the gladness of the land. To the faithful their holy
          days were their holidays. But a reproach had fallen upon the solemn
          assembly, and I believe it is so now at this present moment. It is a,
          sad affliction when in our solemn assemblies the brilliance of the
          gospel light is dimmed by error. The clearness of the testimony is
          spoiled when doubtful voices are scattered among the people, and those
          who ought to preach the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
          truth, are telling out for doctrines the imaginations of men, and the
          inventions of the age. Instead of revelation, we have philosophy,
          falsely so-called; instead of divine infallibility, we have surmises
          and larger hopes. The gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the same
          yesterday, to-day, and for ever, is taught as the production of
          progress, a growth, a thing to be amended and corrected year by year.
          It is an ill day, both for the church and the world, when the trumpet
          does not give a certain sound; for who shall prepare himself for the
          battle?
        </p>
        <p>
          If added to this we should see creeping over the solemn assembly of
          the church a lifelessness, an indifference, and a lack of spiritual
          power, it is painful to a high degree. When the vitality of religion
          is despised, and gatherings for prayer are neglected, what are we
          coming to? The present period of church history is well portrayed by
          the church of Laodicea, which was neither cold nor hot, and therefore
          to be spewed out of Christ's mouth. That church gloried that she was
          rich and increased in goods, and had need of nothing, while all the
          while her Lord was outside, knocking at the door, a door closed
          against him. That passage is constantly applied to the unconverted,
          with whom it has nothing to do: it has to do with a lukewarm church,
          with a church that thought itself to be in an eminently prosperous
          condition, while her living Lord, in the doctrine of his atoning
          sacrifice, was denied an entrance. Oh, if he had found admission --
          and he was eager to find it -- she would soon have flung away her
          imaginary wealth, and he would have given her gold tried in the
          furnace, and white raiment with which she might be clothed. Alas! she
          is content without her Lord, for she has education, oratory, science,
          and a thousand other baubles. Zion's solemn assembly is under a cloud
          indeed, when the teaching of Jesus and his apostles is of small
          account with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          If in addition to this, worldly conformity spreads in the church, so
          that the vain amusements of the world are shared in by the saints,
          then is there reason enough for lamentation, even as Jeremiah cried:
          |How is the gold become dim!| Her Nazarites, who were purer than snow
          and whiter than milk, have become blacker than a coal. |All our
          enemies have opened their mouths against us.| If no longer there is a
          clear distinction between the church and the world, but professed
          followers of Jesus have joined hands with unbelievers, then may we
          mourn indeed! Woe worth the day! An ill time has happened to the
          church and to the world also. We may expect great judgments, for the
          Lord will surely be avenged on such a people as this. Know ye not of
          old that when the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
          fair, and they were joined unto them, then the flood came and swept
          them all away? I need not pursue this subject further, lest our
          burdens take from us the time which is demanded for consolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears from the text that there were some to whom the reproach was
          a burden. They could not make sport of sin. True, there were many who
          said that the evil did not exist at all, and others who declared that
          it was not present in any great degree. Yes, and more hardened spirits
          declared that what was considered to be a reproach was really a thing
          to be boasted of, the very glory of the century. Thus they huffed the
          matter, and made the mourning of the conscientious to be a theme for
          jest. But there was a remnant to whom the reproach of it was a burden;
          these could not bear to see such a calamity. To these the Lord God
          will have respect, as he said by the prophet: -- |Go through the midst
          of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
          foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations
          that be done in the midst thereof.| The many drank wine in bowls and
          anointed themselves with their chief ointments, but they were not
          grieved for the affliction of Joseph (Amos 6:6); but these were
          pressed in spirit and bore the cross, counting the reproach of Christ
          greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. God's people cannot
          bear that Christ's atoning sacrifice should be dishonored; they cannot
          endure that his truth should be trodden as mire in the streets. To
          true believers prosperity means the Holy Ghost blessing the word to
          the conversion of sinners and the building up of saints; and if they
          do not see this, they hang their harps upon the willows. True lovers
          of Jesus fast when the Bridegroom is not with his church: their glow
          is in his glory, and in nothing else. The wife of Phinehas, the son of
          Eli, cried out in her dying agony, |The glory has departed,| and the
          reason that she gave was once because of the death of her husband and
          his father, but twice because |the ark of God is taken.| For this she
          named her new-born child Ichabod -- . |The glory is departed from
          Israel, for the ark of God is taken.| The bitterest pain of this godly
          woman was for the church, and for the honor of our God. So it is with
          God's true people: they lay it much to heart that the truth is
          rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This burdened spirit, is a token of true love to God: those who love
          the Lord Jesus are wounded in his woundings, and vexed with the
          vexings of his Spirit. When Christ is dishonored his disciples are
          dishonored. Those who have a tender heart towards the church can say
          with Paul, |Who is offended, and I burn not?| The sins of the church
          of God are the sorrows of all living members of it. This also marks a
          healthy sensibility, a vital spirituality. Those who are unspiritual
          care nothing for truth or grace: they look to finances, and numbers,
          and respectability. Utterly carnal men care for none of these things;
          and so long as the political aims of Dissenters are progressing, and
          there is an advance in social position, it is enough for them. But men
          whose spirits are of God would sooner see the faithful persecuted than
          see them desert the truth, sooner see churches in the depths of
          poverty full of holy zeal than rich churches dead in worldliness.
          Spiritual men care for the church even when she is in an evil case,
          and cast down by her adversaries: |thy servants take pleasure in her
          stones, and favor the dust thereof.| The house of the Lord is to many
          of us our own house, his family is our family. Unless the Lord Jesus
          be extolled, and his gospel conquer, we feel that our own personal
          interests are blighted, and we ourselves are in disgrace. It is no
          small thing to us: it is our life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I dwelt upon the fact that it is an ill day for God's people
          when the solemn assembly is defiled: the reproach thereof is a burden
          to those who are truly citizens of the New Jerusalem, and because of
          this they are seen to be sorrowful. The Lord here says, |I will gather
          them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly.| They may well be
          sorrowful when such a burden is laid on their hearts. Moreover, they
          see in a hundred ways the ill effect of the evil which they deplore.
          Many are lame and halting; this is hinted at in the promise of the
          nineteenth verse: |I will save her that halteth.| Pilgrims on the road
          to Zion were made to limp on the road because the prophets were |light
          and treacherous persons.| When the pure gospel is not preached, God's
          people are robbed of the strength which they need in their
          life-journey. If you take away the bread, the children hunger. If you
          give the flock poisonous pastures, or fields which are barren as the
          desert, they pine and they become lame in their daily following of the
          shepherd. The doctrinal soon affects the practical. I know many of the
          people of God living in different parts of this country to whom the
          Sabbath is very little of a day of rest, for they hear no truth in
          which rest is to be found, but they are worried and wearied with
          novelties which neither glorify God nor benefit the souls of men. In
          many a place the sheep look up and are not fed. This causes much
          disquietude and breeds doubts and questionings, and thus strength is
          turned to weakness, and the work of faith, the labor of love, and the
          patience of hope are all kept in a halting state. This is a grievous
          evil, and it is all around us. Then, alas! many are |driven out,| of
          whom the nineteenth verse says, |I will gather her that was driven
          out.| By false doctrine many are made to wander from the fold. Hopeful
          ones are made to stray from the path of life, and sinners are left in
          their natural distance from God. The truth which would convince men of
          sin is not preached, while other truths which would lead seekers into
          peace are beclouded, and souls are left in needless sorrow. When the
          doctrines of grace and the glorious atoning sacrifice are not set
          clearly before men's minds, so that they may feel their power, all
          sorts of evils follow. It is terrible to me that this dreadful blight
          should come upon our churches; for the hesitating are driven to
          destruction, the weak are staggered, and even the strong are
          perplexed. The false teachers of these days would, if it were
          possible, deceive the very elect. This makes our hearts very
          sorrowful. How can we help it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, beloved, all the time that the people of God are in this evil
          case, they are not without hope; for close upon all this comes the
          promise of the Lord to restore his wandering ones. We have the sense
          twice over: |I will get them praise and fame in every land where they
          have been put to shame.| |I will make you a name and a praise among
          all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your
          eyes, saith the Lord. |The adversaries cannot silence the eternal
          testimony. They hanged our Lord himself upon a tree; they took down
          his body and buried it in a tomb in the rock; and they set their seal
          upon the stone which they rolled at the mouth of the sepulcher. Surely
          now there was an end of the Christ and his cause. Boast not, ye
          priests and Pharisees! Vain the watch, the stone, the seal! When the
          appointed time had come, the living Christ came forth. He could not be
          holden by the cords of death. How idle their dreams! |He that sitteth
          in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord doth have them in derision.|
          Beloved, the reproach will yet be rolled away from the solemn
          assembly: the truth of God will yet again be proclaimed as with
          trumpet tongue, the Spirit of God will revive his church, and converts
          as many as the sheaves of the harvest shall yet be gathered in. How
          will the faithful rejoice! Those who were burdened and sorrowful shall
          then put on their garments of joy and beauty. Then shall the ransomed
          of the Lord return with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads.
          The conflict is not doubtful. The end of the battle is sure and
          certain. Methinks I even now hear the shout, |The Lord God omnipotent
          reigneth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, let us think of something which shines like a star amid
          the darkness. The second verse of the text presents A GLORIOUS GROUND
          OF CONSOLATION. Here is a rich text indeed. This passage is like a
          great sea, while I am as a little child making pools in the sand which
          skirts its boundless flood. A series of discourses might well be
          founded on this one verse: I mean the seventeenth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our great consolation in the worst times lies in our God. The very
          name of our covenant God -- |the Lord thy God| -- is full of good
          cheer. That word, |the Lord,| is really JEHOVAH, the self-existent
          One, the unchangeable One, the ever-living God, who cannot change or
          be moved from his everlasting purpose. Children of God, whatever you
          have not got, you have a God in whom you may greatly glory. Having God
          you have more than all things, for all things come of him; and if all
          things were blotted out, he could restore all things simply by his
          will. He speaketh, and it is done; he commandeth, and it stands fast.
          Blessed is the man that hath the God of Jacob for his trust, and whose
          hope Jehovah is. In the Lord Jehovah we have righteousness and
          strength; let us trust in him for ever. Let the times roll on, they
          cannot affect our God. Let troubles rush upon us like a tempest, but
          they shall not come nigh unto us now that he is our defense. Jehovah,
          the God of his church, is also the God of each individual member of
          it, and each one may therefore rejoice in him. Jehovah is as much your
          God, my brother, as if no other person in the universe could use that
          covenant expression. O believer, the Lord God is altogether and wholly
          your God! All his wisdom, all his foresight, all his power, all his
          immutability -- all himself is yours. As for the church of God, when
          she is in her lowest estate she is still established and endowed in
          the best possible sense -- established by the divine decree, and
          endowed by the possession of God all-sufficient. The gates of hell
          shall not prevail against her. Let us exult in our possession. Poor as
          we are, we are infinitely rich in having God; weak as we are, there is
          no limit to our strength, since the Almighty Jehovah is ours. |If God
          be for us, who can be against us?| If God be ours, what more can we
          need? Lift up thy heart, thou sorrowful one, and be of good cheer. If
          God be thy God, thou hast all thou canst desire: wrapped up within his
          glorious name we find all things for time and eternity, for earth and
          heaven. Therefore in the name of Jehovah we will set up our banners,
          and march onward to the battle. He is our God by his own purpose,
          covenant, and oath; and this day he is our God by our own choice of
          him, by our union with Christ Jesus, by our experience of his
          goodness, and by that spirit of adoption whereby we cry |Abba,
          Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          To strengthen this consolation, we notice next, that this God is in
          the midst of us. He is not a long way off, to be sought with
          difficulty, if haply we may find him. The Lord is a God nigh at hand,
          and ready to deliver his people. Is it not delightful to think that we
          cry not to God across the ocean, for he is here? We look not up to him
          from afar, as though he dwelt beyond the stars, neither do we think of
          him as hidden in the fathomless abyss; but the Lord is very near. Our
          God is |Jehovah in the midst of thee.| Since that bright night in
          which a babe was born at Bethlehem, and unto us a Son was given, we
          know God as |Emmanuel, God with us.| God is in our nature, and
          therefore very near unto us. |The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
          us.| Though his bodily presence is gone, yet we hare his spiritual
          presence with us evermore; for he saith, |Lo, I am with you alway.| He
          walketh among the golden candlesticks. We have also the immediate
          presence of God the Holy Spirit. He is in the midst of the church to
          enlighten, convince, quicken, endow, comfort, and clothe with
          spiritual power. The Lord still works in the minds of men for the
          accomplishment of his purposes of grace. Let us think of this when we
          are going forth to Christian service: |The Lord of hosts is with us.|
          When you call your class together in the Sabbath school, say to your
          Lord, |If thy presence go not with me, carry me not up hence.| Ah,
          friends! if we have God with us, we can bear to be deserted by men.
          What a word that is, |Where two or three are gathered together in my
          name, there am I in the midst of them!| Shall not the army shout when
          the King himself is in their ranks! Let God arise, let his enemies be
          scattered! When he is with us they that hate him must flee before him.
          Be it our concern so to live that we may never grieve away the Spirit
          of God. Beloved, there is such abundant consolation in the fact of the
          presence of God with us, that if we could only feel the power of it at
          this moment, we should enter into rest, and our heaven would begin
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us go a step further, and note that our consolation is largely to
          be found in the fact that this God in the midst of us is full of power
          to save. |The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will
          save.| That is to say, |Jehovah, thy God, is mighty to save.| His arm
          is not shortened, he is still |a just God and a Saviour.| Nor is he
          merely able to save, but he will display that ability; |he will save.|
          Come, my brother, we see around us this and that to discourage us; let
          us, like David, encourage ourselves in the Lord our God. We may very
          well forget all difficulties, since the God who is in the midst of us
          is mighty to save. Let us pray, then, that he will save; that he will
          save his own church from lukewarmness and from deady error; that he
          will save her from her worldliness and formalism; save her from
          unconverted ministers and ungodly members. Let us lift up our eyes and
          behold the power which is ready to save; and let us go on to pray that
          the Lord may save the unconverted by thousands and millions. Oh, that
          we might see a great revival of religion! This is what we want before
          all things. This would smite the enemy upon the cheek-bone, and break
          the teeth of the adversary. If tens of thousands of souls were
          immediately saved by the sovereign grace of God, what a rebuke it
          would be to those who deny the faith! Oh, for times such as our
          fathers saw when first Whitefield and his helpers began to preach the
          life-giving word! When one sweet voice was heard clear and loud, all
          the birds of paradise began to sing in concert with him, and the
          morning of a glorious day was heralded. Oh, if that were to happen
          again, I should feel like Simeon when he embraced the heavenly babe!
          Then would the virgin daughter of Zion shake her head at the foe, and
          laugh him to scorn. It may happen; yea, if we are importunate in
          prayer it must happen: |God shall bless us, and all the ends of the
          earth shall fear him.| Let us not seek power of rhetoric, much less of
          wealth; but let us look for the power which saves. This is the one
          thing I crave. Oh, that God would save souls! I say to myself, after
          being badgered and worried through the week by the men of modern
          thought: |I will go my way and preach Christ's gospel, and win souls.|
          One lifting up of Jesus Christ crucified is more to me than all the
          cavillings of the men who are wise above what is written. Converts are
          our unanswerable arguments. |Happy is the man,| saith the Psalm, |that
          hath his quiver full of them: they shall speak with the enemies in the
          gate.| Blessed is the man who has many spiritual children born to God
          under his ministry; for his converts are his defense. Beholding the
          man who was healed standing with Peter and John, they could say
          nothing against them. If souls are saved by the gospel, the gospel is
          proved in the surest manner. Let us care more about conversions than
          about organizations. If souls are brought into union with Christ, we
          may let other unions go.
        </p>
        <p>
          We go yet further, and we come to great deeps: behold God's joy in his
          people. |He will rejoice over thee with joy.| Think of this! Jehovah,
          the living God, is described as brooding over his church with
          pleasure. He looks upon souls redeemed by the blood of his dear Son,
          quickened by his Holy Spirit, and his heart is glad. Even the infinite
          heart of God is filled with an extraordinary joy at the sight of his
          chosen. His delight is in his church, his Hephzibah. I can understand
          a minister rejoicing over a soul that he has brought to Christ; I can
          also understand believers rejoicing to see others saved from sin and
          hell; but what shall I say of the infinitely-happy and
          eternally-blessed God finding, as it were, a new joy in souls
          redeemed? This is another of those great wonders which cluster around
          the work of divine grace! |He will rejoice over thee with joy.| Oh,
          you are trembling for the ark of the Lord; the Lord is not trembling,
          but rejoicing. Faulty as the church is, the Lord rejoices in her.
          While we mourn, as well we may, yet we do not sorrow as those that are
          without hope; for God does not sorrow, his heart is glad, and he is
          said to rejoice with joy -- a highly emphatic expression. The Lord
          taketh pleasure in them that fear him, imperfect though they be. He
          sees them as they are to be, and so he rejoices over them, even when
          they cannot rejoice in themselves. When your face is blurred with
          tears, your eyes red with weeping, and your heart heavy with sorrow
          for sin, the great Father is rejoicing over you. The prodigal son wept
          in his Father's bosom, but the Father rejoiced over his son. We are
          questioning, doubting, sorrowing, trembling; and all the while he who
          sees the end from the beginning knows what will come out of the
          present disquietude, and therefore rejoices. Let us rise in faith to
          share the joy of God. Let no man's heart fail him because of the
          taunts of the enemy. Rather let the chosen of God rouse themselves to
          courage, and participate in that joy of God which never ceaseth, even
          though the solemn assembly has become a reproach. Shall we not rejoice
          in him when he, in his boundless condescension, deigns to rejoice in
          us? Whoever despairs for the cause, he does not; wherefore let us be
          of good courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is added, |He will rest in his love.| I do not know any Scripture
          which is more full of wonderful meaning than this. |He shall rest in
          his love,| as if our God had in his people found satisfaction. He
          comes to an anchorage: he has reached his desire. As when a Jacob,
          full of love to Rachel, has at length ended the years of his service,
          and is married to his well-beloved, and his heart is at rest; so is it
          spoken in parable of the Lord our God. Jesus sees of the travail of
          his soul when his people are won to him; he has been baptized with his
          baptism for his church, and he is no longer straitened, for his desire
          is fulfilled. The Lord is content with his eternal choice, content
          with his loving purposes, satisfied with the love which went forth
          from everlasting. He is well pleased in Jesus -- well pleased with all
          the glorious purposes which are connected with his dear Son, and with
          those who are in him. He has a calm content in the people of his
          choice, as he sees them in Christ. This is a good ground for our
          having a deep satisfaction of heart also. We are not what we would be;
          but then we are not what we shall be. We advance slowly; but then we
          advance surely. The end is secured by omnipotent grace. It is right
          that we should be discontented with ourselves, yet this holy
          restlessness should not rob us of our perfect peace in Christ Jesus.
          If the Lord hath rest in us, shall we not have rest in him? If he
          rests in his love, cannot we rest in it?
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart is comforted as I plainly see in these words love unchanging,
          love abiding, love eternal: |he will rest in his love.| Jehovah
          changes not. Being married to his people, |he hateth putting away.|
          Immutability is written on his heart. The turtle-dove, when he has
          once chosen his mate, remains faithful throughout life, and if the
          beloved dies, he will, in many cases, pine away with grief for her,
          for his life is wrapped up in hers. Even so our Lord hath made his
          choice of his beloved, and he will never change it: he died for his
          church, and so long as he lives he will remember his own love, and
          what it cost him: |Who shall separate us from the love of God which is
          in Christ Jesus our Lord?| |He will rest in his love.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The love of God to us is undisturbed: |The peace of God, which passeth
          all understanding,| dwells with his love: he is not disquieted about
          it, but peacefully loves, and is never moved. The calm of God is
          wonderful to contemplate: his infallible knowledge and infinite power
          put him beyond fear or question. He sees no cause of alarm as to his
          redeemed, nor as to the cause of truth and the reign of righteousness.
          As to his true church, he knows that she is right, or that he will
          make her right. She is being transformed into the image of Jesus, and
          he rests in the full assurance that the image will ere long be
          complete. He can carry out his own purposes in his own way and time.
          He can see the harvest as well as the sowing; therefore he doth |rest
          in his love.| You have seen a mother wash her child, and as she washes
          its face the child perhaps is crying, for it does not for the present
          enjoy the cleansing operation. Does the mother share the child's
          grief? Does she also cry? Oh, no! she rejoices over her babe, and
          rests in her love, knowing that the light affliction of the little one
          will work its real good. Often our griefs are no deeper than the cry
          of a child because of the soap in its eyes. While the church is being
          washed with tribulations and persecutions, God is resting in his love.
          You and I are wearying, but God is resting.
        </p>
        <p>
          |He shall rest in his love.| The Hebrew of this line is, |He shall be
          silent in his love.| His happiness in his love is so great, that he
          does not express it, but keeps a happy silence. His is a joy too deep
          for words. No language can express the joy of God in his love; and
          therefore he uses no words. Silence in this case is infinitely
          expressive. One of the old commentators says, |He is deaf and dumb in
          his love,| as if he heard no voice of accusation against his chosen,
          and would not speak a word of upbraiding to her. Remember the silence
          of Jesus, and expound this text thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes also the Lord does not speak to his people: we cannot get a
          cheering word from him; and then we sigh for a promise, and long for a
          visit of his love; but if he be thus silent, let us know that, he is
          only silent in his love. It is not the silence of wrath, but of love.
          His love is not changed, even though he does not comfort us.
        </p>
        <p>|His thoughts are high, his love is wise,</p>
        <p>His wounds a cure intend;</p>
        <p>And though he does not always smile,</p>
        <p>He loves unto the end.|</p>
        <p>
          When he does not answer our prayers with his hand, he yet hears them
          with his heart. Denials are only another form of the same love which
          grants our petitions. He loves us, and sometimes shows that love
          better by not giving us what we ask than he could do if he spoke the
          sweetest promise which the ear has ever heard. I prize this sentence:
          |He shall rest in his love.| My God, thou art perfectly content with
          thy church after all, because thou knowest what she is to be. Thou
          seest how fair she will be when she comes forth from the washing,
          having put on her beautiful garments. Lo, the sun goes down, and we
          mortals dread the endless darkness; but thou, great God, seest the
          morning, and thou knowest that in the hours of darkness dews will fall
          which shall refresh thy garden. Ours is the measure of an hour, and
          thine the judgment of eternity, therefore we will correct our
          short-sighted judgment by thine infallible knowledge, and rest with
          thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last word is, however, the most wonderful of all: |He will joy
          over thee with singing.| Think of the great Jehovah singing! Can you
          imagine it? Is it possible to conceive of the Deity breaking into a
          song: Father, Son and Holy Ghost together singing over the redeemed?
          God is so happy in the love which he bears to his people that he
          breaks the eternal silence, and sun and moon and stars with
          astonishment hear God chanting a hymn of joy. Among Orientals a
          certain song is sung by the bridegroom when he receives his bride: it
          is intended to declare his joy in her, and in the fact that his
          marriage has come. Here, by the pen of inspiration, the God of love is
          pictured as married to his church, and so rejoicing in her that he
          rejoices over her with singing. If God sings, shall not we sing? He
          did not sing when he made the world. No; he looked upon it, and simply
          said that it was good. The angels sang, the sons of God shouted for
          joy: creation was very wonderful to them, but it was not much to God,
          who could have made thousands of worlds by his mere will. Creation
          could not make him sing; and I do not even know that Providence ever
          brought a note of joy from him, for he could arrange a thousand
          kingdoms of providence with ease. But when it came to redemption, that
          cost him dear. Here he spent; eternal thought, and drew up a covenant
          with infinite wisdom. Here he gave his Only-begotten Son, and put him
          to grief to ransom his beloved ones. When all was done, and the Lord
          saw what became of it in the salvation of his redeemed, then he
          rejoiced after a divine manner. What must the joy be which recompenses
          Gethsemane and Calvary! Here we are among the Atlantic waves. The Lord
          God receives an accession to the infinity of his joy in the thought of
          his redeemed people. |He shall rejoice over thee with singing.| I
          tremble while I speak of such themes, lest I should say a word that
          should dishonor the matchless mystery; but still we are glad to note
          what is written, and we are bound to take comfort from it. Let us have
          sympathy with the joy of the Lord, for this will be our strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I close with a brief word upon THE BRAVE CONDUCT SUGGESTED
          THEREBY. Let us not sorrow under the burdens which we bear, but
          rejoice in God, the great Burden-bearer, upon whom this day we roll
          our load. Here it is -- |In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem,
          Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three things for God's people to do. The first is, to be
          happy. Read verse fourteen -- | Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout,
          Israel; be glad and rejoice with all thy heart, daughter of
          Jerusalem.| Any man can sing when his cup is full of delights; the
          believer alone has songs when waters of a bitter cup are wrung out to
          him. Any sparrow can chirp in the daylight; it is only the nightingale
          that can sing in the dark. Children of God, whenever the enemies seem
          to prevail over you, whenever the serried ranks of the foe appear sure
          of victory, then begin to sing. Your victory will come with your song.
          It is a very puzzling thing to the devil to hear saints sing when he
          sets his foot on them. He cannot make it out: the more he oppresses
          them, the more they rejoice. Let us resolve to be all the merrier when
          the enemy dreams that we are utterly routed. The more opposition, the
          more we will rejoice in the Lord: the more discouragement, the more
          confidence. Splendid was the courage of Alexander when they told him
          that there were hundreds of thousands of Persians. |Yet,| he said,
          |one butcher fears not myriads of sheep.| |Ah!| said another, |when
          the Persians draw their bows, their arrows are so numerous that they
          darken the sun.| |It will be fine to fight in the shade.| cried the
          hero. friends, we know whom we have believed, and we are sure of
          triumph! Let us not think for a single second, if the odds against us
          are ten thousand to one, that this is a hardship; rather let us wish
          that they were a million to one, that the glory of the Lord might be
          all the greater in the conquest which is sure. When Athanasius was
          told that everybody was denying the Deity of Christ, then he said, |I,
          Athanasius, against the world|: Athanasius contra mundum became a
          proverbial expression. Brethren, it is a splendid thing to be quite
          alone in the warfare of the Lord. Suppose we had half-a-dozen with us.
          Six men are not much increase to strength, and possibly they may be a
          cause of weakness, by needing to be looked after. If you are quite
          alone, so much the better: there is the more room for God. When
          desertions have cleaned the place out, and left you no friend, now
          every corner can be filled with Deity. As long as there is so much
          that is visible to rely upon, and so much to hope in, there is so much
          the less room for simple trust in God: but now our song is of the Lord
          alone; |for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The next duty is fearlessness: |Fear thou not.| What! not a little?
          No, |Fear thou not.| But surely I may show some measure of trembling?
          No, |Fear thou not.| Tie that knot tight about the throat of unbelief.
          |Fear thou not|: neither this day, nor any day of thy life. When fear
          comes in, drive it away; give it no space. If God rests in his love,
          and if God sings, what canst thou have to do with fear? Have you never
          known passengers on board ship, when the weather was rough, comforted
          by the calm behavior of the captain? One simple-minded soul said to
          his friend, |I am sure there is no cause for fear, for I heard the
          captain whistling.| Surely, if the captain is at ease, and with him is
          all the responsibility, the passenger may be still more at peace. If
          the Lord Jesus at the helm is singing, let us not be fearing. Let us
          have done with every timorous accent. rest in the Lord, and wait
          patiently for him. |Your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
          recompense; he will come and save you.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let us be zealous: |Let not thine hands be slack.| Now is the
          time when every Christian should do more for God than ever. Let us
          plan great things for God, and let us expect great things from God.
          |Let not thine hands be slack.| Now is the hour for redoubled prayers
          and labors. Since the adversaries are busy, let us be busy also. If
          they think they shall make a full end of us, let us resolve to make a
          full end of their falsehoods and delusions. I think every Christian
          man should answer the challenge of the adversaries of Christ by
          working double tides, by giving more of his substance to the cause of
          God, by living more for the glory of God, by being more exact in his
          obedience, more earnest in his efforts, and more importunate in his
          prayers. |Let not thine hands be slack| in any one part of holy
          service. Fear is a dreadful breeder of idleness; but courage teaches
          us indomitable perseverance. Let us go on in God's name. I would stir
          up the members of this church, and all my brethren, to intense zeal
          for God and the souls of men. |Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
          steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
          forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Would God that all were on Christ's side out of this great assembly!
          Oh, that you would come to Jesus, and trust him, and then live for him
          in the midst of this crooked and perverse generation! The Lord be with
          us. Amen.
