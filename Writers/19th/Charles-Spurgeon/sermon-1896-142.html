          ch 57. Thou art my portion, O Jehovah! I have said I will keep thy
          words. ch 58. I have earnestly besought thy face with my whole heart;
          have mercy upon me according to thy word. ch 59. I thought upon my
          ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. ch 60. I made haste,
          and did not delay to keep thy commandments. ch 61. The cords of the
          wicked have caught hold of me; but I did not forget thy law. ch 62. I
          will rise at midnight to praise thee for thy righteous judgments. ch
          63. I am a companion to all those who fear thee, and who keep thy
          precepts. ch 64. O Jehovah! the earth is full of thy mercy; teach me
          thy statutes.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          57. Thou art my portion, O Jehovah! The meaning of this clause is
          doubtful, because the term Jehovah may be rendered either in the
          nominative or vocative case, and the phrase, I have said, may relate
          either to the former or latter part of the verse. One lection then is,
          Jehovah is my portion, and, therefore, I have resolved to observe thy
          law. Another is, O God! who art my portion, I have resolved to observe
          thy law. A third is, I have said, or have resolved, that God is my
          portion, in order to observe his law. A fourth is, I have said, or
          have resolved, O Lord! that my portion is to observe thy law; and this
          is the reading of which I approve. The following interpretation is
          quite applicable, That God being our portion, ought to animate and
          encourage us to observe his law. We have already noticed in several
          other passages, that God is denominated the heritage of the faithful,
          because he alone is sufficient for their full and entire happiness.
          And seeing he has chosen us for his peculiar possession, it is only
          reasonable on our part, that we should rest satisfied with him alone;
          and if we do this, our hearts will also be disposed to keep his law
          and, renouncing all the lusts of the flesh, our supreme delight, and
          firm resolution, will be to continue in the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already said, that this exposition is not inconsistent with the
          scope of the passage, and that it furnishes a very useful doctrine.
          But the last and fourth reading, of which I remarked I approved, is
          more simple, -- I am fully persuaded that my best portion consists in
          keeping God's law; -- and this accords with the saying of Paul,
          |Godliness is the best gain,| (1 Timothy 6:6). David here draws a
          comparison between the keeping of the law, and the imaginary good
          which captivates the ambition of mankind. |Let every one covet what
          seems to him good, and revel in his own pleasures; I have no ground to
          envy them, provided I retain this as my portion, the complete
          surrender of myself to the word of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          58. I have earnestly besought thy face. In this verse David asserts,
          that he still persevered in the exercise of prayer; for without prayer
          faith would become languid and lifeless. The manner in which he
          expresses himself, which, in other languages, might be unpolished,
          among the Hebrews, expresses that familiar communication to which God
          admits, and even invites his servants when they come into his
          presence. The substance of his prayers, and the sum of his desires, he
          comprehends in a single sentence; namely, that he implored the mercy
          of God, the sure hope of which he had formed from his word. Let us
          observe, then, in the first place, we are aroused from our supineness,
          that we may exercise our faith by prayer. In the second place, the
          principal thing for which we ought to pray is, that God, out of his
          free grace, may be favorable to us, look on our affection, and grant
          us relief. God does, indeed, aid us in a variety of ways, and our
          necessities also are innumerable; still the thing which we must
          principally and particularly request is, that he: will have mercy upon
          us, which is the source of every other blessing. And, in the last
          place, that we may not present prayers that have no meaning, let us
          learn that God, in all his promises, is set before us as if he were
          our willing debtor.

          59. I thought upon my ways The amount is, that after the prophet had
          paid due regard to his manner of life, his only aim then was to follow
          the teaching of the law. In these words he intimates indirectly, that
          if it be inquired why men go astray, and are miserably distracted
          amidst conflicting impulses, the reason is, their thoughtlessly
          indulging themselves in the gratification of their passions. Every man
          watches most carefully, and applies all his energy to whatever his
          inclination may lead him, but all are blind in choosing the object
          which they ought to pursue; or rather, as if their eyes were sealed,
          they are either hurried away inconsiderately, or else, through
          carelessness, wander imperceptibly from one object to another. One
          thing is certain, that there is no one who carefully considers his
          ways; and, therefore, it is not without reason the prophet exhorts us,
          that the commencement of a godly life consists in men awaking from
          their lethargy, examining their ways, and, at last, wisely considering
          what it is to regulate their conduct properly. He next instructs us,
          that when a person is inclined in good earnest to frame the course of
          his life well, there is nothing better than for him to follow the
          direction which the Lord points out. In fact, were not men infatuated,
          they would universally and unanimously make choice of God to be the
          guide of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          60. I made haste Though the words are in the past tense, they denote a
          continued act. The prophet declares with what promptitude he dedicated
          himself to the service of God. Diligence and dispatch demonstrate the
          favor of his zeal. Next, in saying that he delayed not, this,
          according to the Hebrew idiom, gives intensity to the idea conveyed by
          the phrase, I made haste As among the Hebrews, to speak and not to
          keep silence is equivalent to speaking freely, unreservedly, and
          without dissimulation, as the occasion demands, so to make haste and
          not delay is to run quickly without doubt or delay. If we reflect on
          our own listlessness, and on the snares which Satan never fails to put
          in our way, we will at once perceive that these words are not added in
          vain. For let a man be ever so desirous of applying himself truly and
          heartily to the righteousness of God, yet, according to Paul, we know
          that |he does not the thing that he would,| (Romans 7:15, 18, 19).
          Although no outward obstacle may stand in our way, yet we are so
          retarded by impediments within, that nothing is more difficult than to
          make haste to keep the law of God. At the same time we must remember,
          that the prophet is here speaking comparatively in reference to those
          who are chargeable with procrastination during the greater part of
          their life, and who draw near to God, not only hesitatingly and
          tardily, but also purposely loiter in their course, or else prevent
          themselves from coming by their tortuous ways. The prophet did not
          manifest more alacrity in serving God than Paul; all he intends,
          therefore, is, that having surmounted all obstacles which lay in his
          way, he prosecuted his journey with rapidity. And by his example he
          teaches us, that the pleas which we offer in extenuation of our
          indolence, either arising from the impediments presented by the world
          or our own infirmity, are vain and frivolous.

          61. The cords of the wicked have caught hold of me. Those who
          translate chvly, cheblei, by sorrows, bring out no natural meaning,
          and perplex themselves as well as wrest the passage. Two readings then
          remain, either of which may be admitted: The cords of the wicked have
          caught hold of me, or The companies of the wicked have robbed me
          Whether we adopt the one or the other of these readings, what the
          prophet intends to declare is, that when Satan assailed the principles
          of piety in his soul, by grievous temptations, he continued with
          undeviating steadfastness in the love and practice of God's law. Cords
          may, however, be understood in two ways; either, first, as denoting
          the deceptive allurements by which the wicked endeavored to get him
          entangled in their society; or, secondly, the frauds which they
          practiced to effect his ruin. If the first sense is preferred, David
          intimates that he had manifested a rare virtue, in continuing in the
          observance of God's law, even when the wicked seemed to have involved
          him in their nets; but as it is more generally agreed that the verb
          vd, ived, signifies to despoil or rob, let us adopt this
          interpretation -- That the prophet being assailed by troops of the
          ungodly, and afterwards robbed and rifled at their pleasure, never
          deserted his ground. This was a proof of singular fortitude; for when
          we are exposed to dangers and wrongs of a more than ordinary kind, if
          God does not see our us we immediately begin to doubt of his
          providence: it seems to be of no advantage for a man to be godly; we
          imagine also that we may lawfully take revenge; and amidst these
          waves, the remembrance of the Divine law is easily lost, and, as it
          were, submerged. But the prophet assures us:, that to continue to love
          the law, and to practice righteousness, when we are exposed as a prey
          to the ungodly, and perceive no help from God, is an evidence of
          genuine piety.

          62 I will rise at midnight to praise thee In this verse he shows not
          only that he approved and embraced with his whole heart whatever the
          Divine law contains, but that he also gave evidence of his gratitude
          to God for having made him partaker of so great a blessing. It seems
          to be quite a common thing professedly to assent to God when he
          teaches us by his law; for who would dare to lift up his voice against
          Him? But still the world is very far from acknowledging that the truth
          which he has revealed is in all respects reasonable. In the first
          place, such is the rebellion of our corrupt nature, that every man
          would have somewhat either altered or taken away. Again, if men had
          their choice, they would rather be governed by their own will than by
          the word of God. In short, human reason, as well as human passions, is
          widely at variance with the Divine law. He then has profited not
          little, who both obediently embraces revealed truth, and, taking sweet
          delight in it, gives thanks to God for it. The prophet, however, does
          not simply declare that he magnifies God's righteous judgments; he
          also affirms that he rose at midnight to do so, by which he expresses
          the earnestness of his desire; for the studies and cares which break
          our sleep necessarily imply great earnestness of soul. He also, at the
          same time, intimates, that in bearing his testimony in behalf of the
          Divine law, he was far from being influenced by ostentation, since in
          his secret retirement, when no human eye was upon him, he pronounced
          the highest encomiums on God's righteous judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          63. I am a companion to all those who fear thee He does not simply
          speak of the brotherly love and concord which true believers cultivate
          among themselves, but intimates that, whenever he met with any
          individual who feared God, he gave him his hand in token of
          fellowship, and that he was not only one of the number of God's
          servants, but also their helper. Such concord is undoubtedly required
          in all the godly, that they may contribute to each other's advancement
          in the fear of God. There seems to be a tacit comparison between this
          holy combination, by which the faithful mutually keep up and foster
          among themselves the worship of God and true godliness, and the
          impious associations which prevail every where in the world. We see
          how worldly men array their troops against God, and assist one another
          in their attempts to overthrow his worship. The more then is it
          necessary for the children of God to be stirred up to the maintenance
          of a holy unity. The Psalmist commends the faithful, first, for their
          fearing God, and, secondly, for their observing the law. The fear of
          God is the root or origin of all righteousness, and by dedicating our
          life to His service, we manifest that His fear dwells in our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          64. O Jehovah! the earth is full of thy mercy Here the prophet
          beseeches God, in the exercise of his infinite goodness, which is
          reflected in every part of the world, graciously to make him a
          partaker of the treasure of heavenly wisdom -- a manner of prayer
          which is very emphatic. When, therefore, he says that the earth is
          full of God's mercy, it is a kind of earnest entreaty. He not only
          magnifies the goodness of God, in general, (as he does in other
          places,) in leaving no part of the world devoid of the proofs of his
          liberality, and in exercising it not only towards mankind, but also
          towards the brute creation. What does he then? He desires that the
          mercy of God, which is extended to all creatures, may be manifested
          towards him in one thing, and that is, by enabling him to make
          progress in the knowledge of the Divine law. Whence we gather, that he
          accounted the gift of understanding as an inestimable treasure. No if
          to be endued with the spirit of understanding is a chief token of
          God's favor, our want of this, proceeding from our own unbelief, is an
          indication of our alienation from him. It behooves us to remember what
          we have stated elsewhere, that it is an evidence that we have given
          ourselves up to the most shameful sloth, when, contented with a
          superficial knowledge of Divine truth, we are, in a great measure,
          indifferent about making further progress, seeing so renowned a
          teacher of the Church labored with the greatest ardor to become more
          and more acquainted with God's statutes. Besides, it is certain that
          he does not here treat of external teaching, but of the inward
          illumination of the mind, which is the gift of the Holy Spirit. The
          law was exhibited to all without distinction; but the prophet, well
          aware that unless he were enlightened by the Holy Spirit, it would be
          of little advantage to him, prays that he may be taught effectually by
          supernatural influence.
