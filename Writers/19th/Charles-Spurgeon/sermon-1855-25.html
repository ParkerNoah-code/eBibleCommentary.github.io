        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved,
          and in them that perish: To the one we are the savour of death unto
          death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is
          sufficient for these things?| -- 2 Corinthians 2:15-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE ARE THE words of Paul, speaking on the behalf of himself and his
          brethren the Apostles, and they are true concerning all those who by
          the Spirit are chosen, qualified, and thrust into the vineyard to
          preach God's gospel. I have often admired the 14th verse of this
          chapter, especially when I have remembered from whose lips the words
          fell, |Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
          Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every
          place.| Picture Paul, the aged, the man who had been beaten five times
          with ,forty stripes save one,' who had been dragged forth for dead,
          the man of great sufferings, who had passed through whole seas of
          persecution only think of him saying, at the close of his ministerial
          career, |Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
          Christ!| to triumph when shiprecked, to triumph when scourged, to
          triumph in the stocks, to triumph under the stones, to triumph amidst
          the hiss of the world, to triumph when he was driven from the city and
          shook off the dust from his feet, to triumph at all times in Christ
          Jesus! Now, if some ministers of modern times should talk thus, we
          would think little of it, for they enjoy the world's applause They can
          always go to their place in ease and peace; they have an admiring
          people, and no open foes; against them not a dog doth move his tongue;
          everything is safe and pleasant, For them to say, |Now thanks be unto
          God, which always causeth us to triumph| is a very little thing; but
          for one like Paul, so trampled on, so tried, so distressed, to say
          it-then, we say, outspoke a hero; here is a man who had true faith in
          God and in the divinity of his mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, my brethren, how sweet is that consolation which Paul applied to
          his own heart amid all his troubles. |Notwithstanding all,| he says,
          |God makes known the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.|
          Ah! with this thought a minister may lay his head upon his pillow:
          |God makes manifest the savour of his knowledge.| With this he may
          shut his eyes when his career is over, and with this he may open them
          in heaven: |God hath made known by me the savour of his knowledge in
          every place,| Then follow the words of my text, of which I shall
          speak, dividing it into three particulars. Our first remark shall be,
          that although the gospel is |a sweet savour| in every place, yet it
          produces different effects in different persons; to one it is the
          savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto
          life.| Our second observation shall be, that ministers of the gospel
          are not responsible for their success, for it is said. |We are unto
          God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that
          perish.| And thirdly, yet the gospel ministers place is by no means a
          light one: his duty is very weighty; for the Apostle himself said,
          |Who is sufficient for these things?|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Our first remark is, that THE GOSPEL PRODUCES DIFFERENT EFFECTS. It
          must seem a strange thing, but it is strangely true, that there is
          scarcely ever a good thing in the world of which some little evil is
          not the consequence. Let the sun shine in brilliance -- it shall
          moisten the wax, it shall harden clay; let it pour down floods of
          light on the tropics -- it will cause vegetation to be extremely
          luxuriant, the richest and choicest fruits shall ripen, and the
          fairest of all flowers shall bloom, but who does not know, that there
          the worst of reptiles and the most venomous snakes are also brought
          forth? So it is with the gospel. Although it is the very sun of
          righteousness to the world, although it is God's best gift, although
          nothing can be in the least comparable to the vast amount of benefit
          which it bestows upon the human race, yet even of that we must
          confess, that sometimes it is the |savour of death unto death.| But
          then we are not to blame the gospel for this; it is not the fault of
          God's truth; it is the fault of those who do not receive it. It is the
          |savour of life unto life| to every one that listens to its sound with
          a heart that is open to its reception. It is only |death unto death|
          to the man who hates the truth, despises it, scoffs at it, and tries
          to oppose its progress, It is of that character we must speak first.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The gospel is to some men |a savour of death unto death.| Now, this
          depends very much upon what the gospel is; because there are some
          things called gospel, that are |a savour of death unto death| to
          everybody that hears them. John Berridge says he preached morality
          till there was not a moral man left in the village; and there is no
          way of injuring morality like legal preaching. The preaching of good
          works, and the exhorting men to holiness, as the means of salvation,
          is very much admired in theory; but when brought into practice, it is
          found not only ineffectual, but more than that -- it becomes even |a
          savour of death unto death.| So it has been found; and I think even
          the great Chalmers himself confessed, that for years and years before
          he knew the Lord, he preached nothing but morality and precepts, but
          he never found a drunkard reclaimed by shewing him merely the evils of
          drunkenness; nor did he find a swearer stop his swearing because he
          told him the heinousness of the sin; it was not until he begin to
          preach the love of Jesus, in his great heart of mercy-it was not until
          he preached the gospel as it was in Christ, in some of its clearness,
          fulness, and power, and the doctrine, that |by grace ye are saved,
          through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God| that
          he ever met with success. But when he did preach salvation by faith,
          by shoals the drunkards came from their cups, and swearers refrained
          their lips from evil speaking; thieves became honest men, and
          unrighteous and ungodly persons bowed to the scepter of Jesus. But ye
          must confess, as I said before, that though the gospel does in the
          main produce the best effect upon almost all who hear it either by
          restraining them from sin, or constraining them to Christ, yet it is a
          great fact, and a solemn one, upon which I hardly know bow to speak
          this morning, that to some men the preaching of Christ's gospel is
          |death unto death,| and produces evil instead of good.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) And the first sense is this. Many men are hardened in their sins
          by hearing the gospel. Oh! tis terribly and solemnly true, that of all
          sinners some sanctuary sinners are the worst. Those who can dive
          deepest into sin, and have the most quiet consciences and hardest
          hearts, are some who are to be found in God's own house. I know that a
          faithful ministry will often prick them, and the stern denunciations
          of a Boanerges, will frequently make them shake. I am aware that the
          Word of God will sometimes make their blood curdle within them; but I
          know (for I have seen the men) that there are many who turn the grace
          of God into licentiousness, make even God's truth a stalking-horse for
          the devil, and abuse God's grace to pall ate their sin. Such men have
          I found amongst those who hear the doctrines of grace in their
          fulness. They will say, |I am elect, therefore I may swear; I am one
          of those who were chosen of God before the foundation of the world,
          and therefore I may live as I list.| I have seen the man who stood
          upon the table of a public house, and grasping the glass in his hand,
          said, |Mates! I can say more than any of you; I am one of those who
          are redeemed with Jesus' precious blood:| and then he drank his
          tumbler of ale and danced again before them, and sang vile and
          blasphemous songs. Now, that is a man to whom the gospel is |a savour
          of death unto death.| He bears the truth, but he perverts it; he takes
          what is intended by God for his good, and what does he do, he commits
          suicide therewith. That knife which was given him to open the secrets
          of the gospel he drives into his own heart. That which is the purest
          of all truth and the highest of all morality, he turns into the
          panderer of his vice, and makes it a scaffold to aid in building up
          his wickedness and sin. Are there any of you here like that man -- who
          love to hear the gospel, as ye call it, and yet live impurely? who can
          sit down and say you are the children of God, and still behave like
          liege servants of the devil? Be it known unto you, that ye are liars
          and hypocrites, for the truth is not in you at all. |If any man is
          born of God, he cannot sin.| God's elect will not be suffered to fall
          into continual sin; they will never |turn the grace of God into
          licentiousness;| but it will be their endeavour, as much as in them
          lies, to keep near to Jesus. Rest assured of this: |By their fruits ye
          shall know them.| A good tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit;
          neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.| Such men, however,
          are continually turning the gospel into evil, They sin with a high
          hand, from the very fact that they have heard what they consider
          excuses their vice. There is nothing under heaven, I conceive, more
          liable to lead men astray than a perverted gospel. A truth perverted
          is generally worse than a doctrine which all know to be false. As
          fire, one of the most useful of the elements, can also cause the
          fiercest of conflagrations, so the gospel, the best thing we have, can
          be turned to the vilest account. This is one sense in which it is |a
          savour of death unto death.|
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) But another. It is a fact that the gospel of Jesus Christ will
          increase some mens damnation at the last great day. Again, I startle
          at myself when I have said it; for it seems too horrible a thought for
          us to venture to utter -- that the gospel of Christ will make hell
          hotter to some men than it otherwise would have been. Men would all
          have sunk to hell had it not been for the gospel. The grace of God
          reclaims |a multitude that no man can number;| it secures a countless
          army who |shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation;|
          but, at the same time, it does to those who reject it, make their
          damnation even more dreadful. And let me tell you why.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because men sin against greater light; and the light we have is
          an excellent measure of our guilt. What a Hottentot might do without a
          crime, would be the greatest sin to me, because I am taught better;
          and what some even in London might do with irnpunity -- set down, as
          it might be, as a sin by God, but not so exceeding sinful-would be to
          me the very height of transgression, because I have from my youth up
          been tutored to piety. The gospel comes upon men like the light from
          heaven. What a wanderer must he be who strays in the light! If he who
          is blind falls into the ditch we can pity him, but if a man, with the
          light on his eyeballs dashes himself from the precipice and loses his
          own soul, is not pity out of the question?
        </p>
        <p>|How they deserve the deepest hell,</p>
        <p>That slight the joys above!</p>
        <p>What chains of vengeance must they feel,</p>
        <p>Who laugh at sov'reign love!|</p>
        <p>
          It will increase your condemnation, I tell you all, unless you find
          Jesus Christ to he your Saviour; for to have had the light and not to
          walk by it, shall be the condemnation, the very essence of it, This
          shall be the virus of the guilt -- that the, |light came into the
          world, and the darkness comprehended it not;| for |men love darkness
          rather than light, because their deeds are evil.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: it must increase your condemnation if you oppose the gospel. If
          God devises a scheme of mercy, and man rises up against it, how great
          must be his sin? Who shall tell the great guilt incurred by such men
          as Pilate, Herod, and the Jews? Oh! who shall picture out, or even
          faintly sketch, the doom of those who cried, |Crucify him! Crucify
          him!| And who shall tell what place in hell shall be hot enough for
          the man who slanders God's minister, who speaks against his people,
          who hates his truth, who would, if he could, utterly cut off the godly
          from the land? Ah! God help the infidel! God help the blasphemer! God
          save his soul: for of all men least would I choose to be that man.
          Think you, sirs, that God will not take account of what men have said?
          One man has cursed Christ; he has called him a charlatan. Another has
          declared, (know that he spoke a lie) that the gospel was false. A
          third has proclaimed his licentious maxims, and then has pointed to
          God's Word and still, |There are worse things there!| A fourth has
          abused God's ministers and held up their imperfections to radicals.
          Think you God shall forget all this: it the last day? When his enemies
          come before him, shall he take then by the hand and say, |The other
          day thou didst call my servant a dog, and spit on him, and for this I
          will give thee heaven!| Rather, if the sin has not been cancelled by
          the blood of Christ, he will not say, |Depart, cursed one, into the
          hell which thou didst scoff at; leave that heaven which thou didst
          despise; and learn that though thou saidst there was no God, this
          right arm shall teach thee eternally the lesson that there is one; for
          he who discovers it not by my works of benevolence shall learn it by
          my deeds of vengeance: therefore depart, again, I say!| It shall
          increase men's hell that they have opposed God's truth. Now, is not
          this a very solemn view of the gospel, that it is indeed to many |a
          savour of death unto death?|
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Yet, once more. I believe the gospel make some men in this world
          more miserable than they would be. The drunkard could drink, and could
          revel in his intoxication with greater joy, if he did not hear it
          said, |All drunkards shall have their portion in the lake that burneth
          with fire and brimstone.| How jovially the Sabbath-breaker would riot
          through his Sabbaths, if the Bible did not say, |Remember the Sabbath
          day to keep it holy!| And how happily could the libertine and
          licentious man drive on his mad career, if he were not told, |The
          wages of sin is death, and after death the judgment!| But the truth
          puts the bitter in his cup; the warnings of God freeze the current of
          his soul. The gospel is like the skeleton at the Egyptian feast.
          Though by day he laughed at it, by night he will quiver as the aspen
          leaf, and when the shades of evening gather around him, he will shake
          at a whisper. At the thought of a future state his joy is spoiled, and
          immortality instead of being a boon to him, is in its very
          contemplation the misery of his existence. The sweet wooings of mercy
          are to him no more harmonious than peals of thunder, because he knows
          he despises them. Yea, I have known some who have, been in such misery
          under the gospel, because they would not give up their sins, that they
          have been ready to take their own lives. Oh! terrible thought! The,
          gospel is |a savour of death unto death!| Unto how many here is it so?
          Who are now hearing God's Word to be damned by it? Who shall retire
          hence to be hardened by the sound of the truth? Why, every man who
          does not believe it; for unto those that receive it, it is |a savour
          of life unto life,| but to unbelievers it is a curse, and a savour of
          death unto death.|
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But, blessed be God, the gospel has a second power. Besides being
          |death unto death,| it is |a savour of life unto life.| Ah! my
          brethren, some of us could speak, if we were allowed this meaning, of
          the gospel as being |a savour of life| to us. We can look back to that
          hour when we were |dead in trespasses and sin.| In vain all Sinai's
          thunders; in vain the rousing of the watchmen; we slept on in the
          death-sleep of our transgressions; nor could, an angel have aroused
          us. But we look back with joy to that hour when first we stepped
          within the walls of a sanctuary, and savingly heard the voice of
          mercy. With some of you it is but a few weeks. I know where ye are and
          who ye are. But a few weeks or months ago ye too were far from God,
          but now ye are brought to love him. Canst thou look back my brother
          Christian, to that very moment when the gospel was to thee -- when
          thou didst cast away thy sins, renounce thy lusts, and turning to
          God's Word, received it with full purpose of heart? Ah! that hour --
          of all hours the sweetest! Nothing can be compared, therewith. I knew
          a person who for forty or fifty years had been completely deaf.
          Sitting one morning at her cottage door as some vehicle was passing,
          she thought she heard melodious music. It was not music; it was but
          the sound of the vehicle. Her ear had suddenly opened, and that rough
          sound seemed to her like the music of heaven, because it was the first
          she had heard for so many years. Even so, the first time our ears were
          opened to hear the words of love -- the assurance of our pardon -- we
          never heard the word so well as we did then; it never seemed so sweet;
          and perhaps, even now, we look back and say,
        </p>
        <p>|What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!</p>
        <p>How sweet their memory still!|</p>
        <p>When first it was |a savour of life| unto our souls.</p>
        <p>
          Then, beloved, if it ever has been |a savour of life,| it will always
          be |of life;| because it says it is not of savour of life unto death,
          but a savour of life unto life. |Now I must aim another blow at my
          antagonists the Arminians; I cannot help it. They will have it that
          sometimes the gospel is a savour of life unto death. They tell us that
          a man may receive spiritual life, and vet may die eternally. That is
          to say, a man may be forgiven, and yet be punished afterwards; he may
          be justified from all sin, and yet after that, his transgressions can
          be laid on his shoulders again. A man may be born of God, and yet die;
          a man may be loved of God, and yet God may hate him to-morrow. Oh! I
          cannot bear to speak of such doctrines of lies; let those believe them
          that like. As for me, I so deeply believe in the immutable love of
          Jesus that I suppose that if one believer were, to be in hell, Christ
          himself' would not long stay in heaven, but would cry, |To the
          rescue!| Oh! if Jesus Christ were in glory with one the gems wanting
          in his crown, and Satan had that gem, he would say, |Aha! prince of
          light and glory, I have one of thy jewels!| and he would hold it up,
          and then he would say, |Aha! thou didst die for this man, but thou
          hadst not strength enough to save him; thou didst love him once --
          where is thy love? It is not worth having, for thou didst hate him
          afterwards!| And how would he chuckle over that heir of heaven, and
          hold him up, and say, |This man was redeemed; Jesus Christ purchased
          him with his blood:| and plunging him in the waves of hell, he would
          say, |There purchased one see how I can rob the Son of God!| And then
          again he would say, This man was forgiven, behold the justice of God!
          He is to be punished after he is forgiven. Christ suffered for this
          mans sins, and yet,| says Satan with a malignant joy, |I have him
          afterwards; for God exacted the punishment twice!| Shall that e'er be
          said? Ah! no. It is |a savour of life unto life,| and not of life unto
          death. Go, with your vile gospel; preach it where you please; but my
          Master said, |I give unto my sheep ETERNAL life.| You give to your
          sheep temporary life, and they lose it; but, says Jesus, |I give unto
          my sheep ETERNAL life, and they shall never perish, neither shall man
          pluck them out of my hands.| I generally wax warm when I got to this
          subject, because I think few doctrines more vital than that of the
          perseverance of the saints; for if ever one child of God did perish,
          or if I knew it were possible that one could, I should conclude, at
          once that I must , and suppose each of you would do the same; and then
          where is the joy and happiness of the gospel? Again I tell you the
          Arminian gospel is the shell without the kernel; it is the husk
          without the fruit; and those who love it may take it to themselves. We
          will not quarrel with them. Let them go and preach it. Let them go and
          tell poor sinners, that if they believe in Jesus they will be damned
          after all, that Jesus Christ will forgive them and yet the Father send
          them to hell. Go and preach your gospel, and who will listen to it?
          And if they do listen, is it worth their hearing? I say no; for if I
          am to stand after conversion on the same footing as I did before
          conversion then it is of no use for me to have been converted at all.
          But whom he loves he loves to the end.

        <p>Nothing from his love can sever.|</p>
        <p>
          It is |a savour of life unto life.| And not only, |life unto life| in
          this world, but of |life unto life| eternal. Every one who has this
          life shall receive the next life; for |the Lord will give grace and

          uprightly.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I am obliged to leave this point; but if my Master will but take it
          up, and make his word ,a savour of |life unto life| this morning, I
          shall rejoice in what I have said.
        </p>

          II. But our second remark was, that THE MINISTER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
          FOR HIS SUCCESS. He is responsible for what he preaches; he is
          accountable for his life and actions; but he is not responsible for
          other people. If I do but preach God's word, if there never were a
          soul saved, the King would say, |Well done, good and faithful
          Servant!| If I do but tell my message, if none should listen to it, he
          would say, |Thou hast fought the good fight: receive thy crown.| You
          hear the words of the text: |We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ,
          as well in them that perish, as in them that are saved.| This will
          appear, if I just tell you what a gospel minister is called in the
          Bible. Sometimes he is called an ambassador. Now, for what is an
          ambassador responsible? He goes to a country as a plenipotentiary; he
          carries terms of peace to the conference; he uses all his talents for
          his master; he tries to show that the war is inimical to the
          prosperity of the different countries; he endeavours to bring about
          peace; but the other kings haughtily refuse it. When he comes home
          does his master say, |Why did not you make peace?| |Why, my Lord,| he
          would say, |I told them the terms; but they said nothing.| |Well,
          then,| he will say, |thou hast done thy duty; I am not to condemn thee
          if the war continues.| Again the minister of the gospel is called a
          fisherman. Now a fisherman is not responsible for the quantity of fish
          he catches, but for the way he fishes. That is a mercy for some
          ministers, I am sure, for they have neither caught fish, for neither
          caught fish nor even attracted any round their nets. They have been
          spending all their life fishing with most elegant silk lines, and gold
          and silver hooks; they always use nicely polished phrases; but the
          fish will not bite for all that, whereas we of a rougher order have
          put the hook into the jaws of hundreds. However, if we cast the gospel
          net in the right place, even if we catch none, the Master will find no
          fault with us He will say, |Fisherman! didst thou labour? Didst thou
          throw the net into the sea in the time of storms?| |Yes, my Lord, I
          did.| |What hast thou caught?| |Only one or two.| |Well, I could have
          sent thee a shoal, if it so pleased me; it is not thy fault; I give in
          my sovereignty where I please; or withhold when I choose; but as for
          thee, thou hast well laboured, therefore there is thy reward.|
          Sometimes the minister is called a sower. Now, no farmer expects a
          sower to be responsible for the harvest; all he is responsible for is,
          does be sow the seed? and does he sow the right seed? If he scatters
          it on good soil, then he is happy; but if it falls by the way-side,
          and the fowls of the air devour it, who shall blame the sower? Could
          he help it? Nay, he did his duty; he scattered the seed broad-cast,
          and there he left it. Who is to blame? Certainly not the sower. So,
          beloved, if a minister comes to heaven with but one sheaf on his
          shoulder, his Master will say, |O reaper! once a sower! where didst
          thou gather thy sheaf?| |My Lord, I sowed upon the rock, and it would
          not grow; only one seed on a chance Sabbath morning was blown a little
          awry by the wind, and it fell on a prepared heart; and this is my one
          sheaf.| |Hallelujah!| the angelic choirs resound, |one sheaf from a
          rock is more honour to God than a thousand sheaves from a good soil;
          therefore, let him take his seat as near the throne as yon man, who,
          stooping beneath his many sheaves, comes from some fertile land,
          bringing his sheaves with hm.| I believe that if there are degrees in
          glory, they will not be in proportion to success, but in proportion to
          the earnestness of our endeavours. If we mean right, and if with all
          our heart we strive to do the right thing as ministers if we never see
          any effect, still shall we receive the crown. But how much more happy
          is the man who shall have it in heaven said to him, |He shines for
          ever, because he was wise, and won many souls unto righteousness.| It
          is always my greatest joy to believe, that if I should enter heaven, I
          shall in future days see heaven's gates open, and in shall fly a
          cherub, who, looking me in the face, will smilingly pass along to
          God's throne, and there bow down before him and when has paid his
          homage and his adoration, he may fly to me, and though unknown, shall
          clasp my hand. and if there were tears in heaven, surely I should
          weep, and he would say, |Brother, from thy lips I heard the word; thy
          voice first admonished me of my sin; here I am, and thou the
          instrument of my salvation.| And as the gates open one after another,
          still will they come in; souls ransomed, souls ransomed; and for each
          one of these a star -- for each one of these another gem in the diadem
          of glory -- for each one of them another honor, and another note in
          the song of praise. Blessed be that man that shall die in the Lord,
          and his works shall follow him; for thus saith the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will become of some good Christians now in Exeter Hall, if crowns
          in heaven are measured in value by the souls that are saved? Some of
          you will have a crown in heaven without a single star in it. I read a
          little while ago, a piece upon the starless crown in heaven -- a man
          in heaven with a crown without a star! Not one saved by him! He will
          sit in heaven as happy as he can be, for sovereign mercy saved him;
          but oh! to be in heaven without a single star! Mother! what sayest
          thou to be in heaven without one of thy children to deck thy brow with
          a star? Minister! what wouldst thou say to be a polished preacher and
          yet have no star? Writer! will it well become thee to have written
          even as gloriously as Milton, if thou shouldst be found in heaven
          without a star? I am afraid we pay too little regard to this. Men will
          sit down and write huge folios and tomes, that they may have them put
          in libraries for ever, and have their names handed down by fame! but
          how few are looking to win stars for ever in heaven! Toil on, child of
          God, toil on; for if thou wishest to serve God, thy bread cast upon
          the waters shall be found after many days. If thou sendest in the feet
          of the ox or the ass, thou shalt reap a glorious harvest in that day
          when he comes to gather in his elect. The minister is not responsible
          for his success.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But yet, in the last place, TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IS HIGH AND
          SOLEMN WORK. The ministry has been very often degraded into a trade.
          In these days men are taken and made into ministers who would have
          made good captains at sea, who could have waited well at the counter,
          but who were never intended for the pulpit. They are selected by man,
          they are crammed with literature; they are educated up to a certain
          point; they are turned out ready dressed; and persons call them
          ministers. I wish them all God-speed, every one of them; for as good
          Joseph Irons used to say, |God be with many of them, if it be only to
          make them hold their tongues.| Man-made ministers are of no use in
          this world, and the sooner we get rid of them the better. Their way is
          this: they prepare their manuscripts very carefully, then read it on
          the Sunday most sweetly in sotto voce, and so the people go away
          pleased. But that is not God's way of preaching. If so, I am
          sufficient to preach forever. I can buy manuscript sermons for a
          shilling; that is to say, provided they have been preached fifty times
          before, but if I use them for the first time the price is a guinea, or
          more. But that is not the way. Preaching God's word is not what some
          seem to think, mere child's play -- a mere business or trade to be
          taken up by any one. A man ought to feel first that he has a solemn
          call to it; next, he ought to know that he really possesses the Spirit
          of God, and that when he speaks there is an influence upon him that
          enables him to speak as God would have him, otherwise out of the
          pulpit he should go directly; he has no right to be there, even if the
          living is his own property. He has not been called to preach God's
          truth, and unto him God says, |What hast thou to do, to declare my
          statutes?|
        </p>
        <p>
          But you say, |What is there difficult about preaching God's gospel?|
          Well it must be somewhat hard; for Paul said, |Who is sufficient for
          these things?| And first I will tell you, it is difficult because it
          is so hard as not to be warped by your own prejudices in preaching the
          word. You want to say a stern thing; and your heart says, |Master! in
          so doing thou wilt condemn thyself;| then the temptation is not to say
          it. Another trial is, you are afraid of displeasing the rich in your
          congregations. Your think, |If I say such-and-such a thing, so-and-so
          will be offended; such an one does not approve of that doctrine; I had
          better leave it out.| Or perhaps you will happen to win the applause
          of the multitude, and you must not say anything that will displease
          them, for if they cry, |Hosanna| to day, they will cry, |Crucify,
          crucify,| to-morrow. All these things work on a minister heart. He is
          a man like yourselves; and he feels it. Then comes again the sharp
          knife of criticism, and the arrows of those who hate him and hate his
          Lord; and he cannot help feeling it sometimes. He may put on his
          armour, and cry, |I care not for your malice;| but there were seasons
          when the archers sorely grieved even Joseph. Then he stands in another
          danger, lest he should come out and defend himself; for he is a great
          fool whoever tries to do it. He who lets his detractors alone, and
          like the eagle cares not for the chattering of the sparrows, or like
          the lion will not turn aside to rend the snarling jackal -- he is the
          man, and he shall be honoured. But the danger is, we want to set
          ourselves right. And oh! who is sufficient to steer clear from these
          rocks of danger? |Who is sufficient,| my brethren, |for these things?|
          To stand up, and to proclaim, Sabbath after Sabbath, and week-day
          after week-day, |the unsearchable riches of Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said thus much, I may draw the inference -- to close up --
          which is: if the gospel is |a savour of life unto life,| and if the
          minister's work be solemn work, how well it becomes all lovers of the
          truth to plead for all those who preach it, that they may be
          |sufficient for these things.| To lose my Prayer-book, as I have often
          told you, is the worst thing that can happen to me. To have no one to
          pray for me would place me in a dreadful condition. |Perhaps,| says a
          good poet, |the day when the world shall perish, will be the day
          unwhitened by a prayer;| and, perhaps, the day when a minister turned
          aside from truth, was the day when his people left off to pray for
          him, and when there was not a single voice supplicating grace on his
          behalf. I am sure, it must be so with me. Give me the numerous hosts
          of men whom it has been my pride and glory to see in my place before I
          came to this hall: give me those praying people, who on the Monday
          evening met in such a multitude to pray to God for a blessing, and we
          will overcome hell itself, in spite of all that may oppose us. All our
          perils are nothing, so long as we have prayer. But increase my
          congregation; give me the polite and the noble, -- give me influence
          and understanding; and I should fail to do anything without a praying
          church. My people! shall I ever lose your prayers? Will ye ever cease
          your supplications? Our toils are nearly ended in this great place,
          and happy shall we be to return to our much-loved sanctuary. Will ye
          then ever cease to pray? I fear ye have not uttered so many prayers
          this morning as ye should have done; I fear there has not been so much
          earnest devotion as might have been poured forth. For my own part, I
          have not felt the wondrous power I sometimes experience. I will not
          lay it at your doors; but never let it be said, |Those people, once so
          fervent, have become cold!| Let not Laodiceanism get into Southwark;
          let us leave it here in the West-end, if it is to be anywhere; let us
          not carry it with us. Let us |strive together for the faith once
          delivered unto the saints:| and knowing in what a sad position the
          standard. bearer stands, I beseech you rally round him; for it will be
          ill with the army,
        </p>
        <p>|If the standard bearer fall, as fall full well he may.</p>
        <p>For never saw I promise yet, of such a deadly fray.|</p>
        <p>
          Stand up my friends; grasp the banner yourselves, and maintain it
          erect until the day shall come, when standing on the last conquered
          castle of hell's domains, we shall raise the shout, |Hallelujah!
          Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!| Till that
          time, fight on.<br />
