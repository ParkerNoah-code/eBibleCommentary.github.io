        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
          word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.| -- Luke 2:29-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          BLESSED WERT THOU, O Simeon, for flesh and blood had not revealed this
          unto thee; neither had it enabled thee so cheerfully to bid the world
          farewell. The flesh clings to the earth -- it is dust, and owns
          affluity to the ground out of which it was taken; it loathes to part
          from mother earth. Even old age, with its infirmities, does not make
          men really willing to depart out of this world. By nature we hold to
          life with a terrible tenacity; and even when we sigh over the evils of
          life, and repine concerning its ills, and fancy that we wish ourselves
          away, it is probable that our readiness to depart lies only upon the
          surface, but down deep in our hearts we have no will to go. Flesh and
          blood had not revealed unto Simeon that he saw God's salvation in that
          babe which he took out of the arms of Mary, and embraced with eager
          joy. God's grace had taught him that this was the Savior, and God's
          grace at the same time loosened the cords which bound him to earth,
          and made him feel the attractions of the better land. Blessed is that
          man who has received thy grace a meekness for heaven, and a
          willingness to depart to that better land: let him magnify the Lord
          who has wrought so great a work in him. As Paul says, |Thanks be unto
          the Father who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
          the saints in light.| Certainly none of us were meet by nature -- not
          even Simeon; the fitness of the venerable man was all the handiwork of
          God, and so, also, was his anxiety to obtain the inheritance for which
          God had prepared him. I trust, brethren, while we consider this
          morning the preparedness of the saints for heaven, and turn over in
          our mind those reflections which will make us ready to depart, God's
          Holy Spirit, sent forth from the Father, may make us also willing to
          leave these mortal shores, and launch upon the eternal sea at the
          bidding of our Father, God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall note, this morning, first, that every believer may be assured
          of departing in peace; but that, secondly, some believers feel a
          special readiness to depart now: |Now lettest thou thy servant depart
          in peace;| and, thirdly, that there are words of encouragement to
          produce in us the like readiness: |according to thy word.| There are
          words of Holy Writ which afford richest consolation in prospect of
          departure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, let us start with the great general principle, which
          is full of comfort; namely, this, that EVERY BELIEVER MAY BE ASSURED
          OF ULTIMATELY DEPARTING IN PEACE. This is no privilege peculiar to
          Simeon, it is common to all the saints, since the grounds upon which
          this privilege rests are not monopolised by Simeon, but belong to us
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, first, that all the saints have seen God's salvation,
          therefore, should they all depart in peace. It is true, we cannot take
          up the infant Christ into our arms, but he is |formed in us, the hope
          of glory.| It is true, we cannot look upon him with these mortal eyes,
          but we have seen him with those eyes immortal which death cannot dim
          -- the eyes of our own spirit which have been opened by God's Holy
          Spirit. A sight of Christ with the natural eye is not saving, for
          thousands saw him and then cried, |Crucify him, crucify him.| After
          all, it was in Simeon's case the spiritual eye that saw, the eye of
          faith that truly beheld the Christ of God; for there were others in
          the temple who saw the babe; there was the priest who performed the
          act of circumcision, and the other officials who gathered round the
          group; but I do not know that any of them saw God's salvation. They
          saw the little innocent child that was brought there by its parents,
          but they saw nothing remarkable in him; perhaps, Simeon and Anna,
          alone of all those who were in the temple, saw with the inward eye the
          real Anointed of God revealed as a feeble infant. So, though you and I
          miss the outward sight of Christ, we need not regret it, it is but
          secondary as a privilege; if with the inner sight we have seen the
          Incarnate God, and accepted him as our salvation, we are blessed with
          holy Simeon. Abraham saw Christ's day before it dawned, and even thus,
          after it has passed, we see it, and with faithful Abraham we are glad.
          We have looked unto him, and we are lightened. We have beheld the Lamb
          of God which taketh away the sins of the world. In the |despised and
          rejected of men| we have seen the anointed Savior; in the crucified
          and buried One, who afterwards rose again, and ascended into glory, we
          have seen salvation, full, free, finished. Why, therefore, should we
          think ourselves less favored than Simeon? From like causes like
          results shall spring: we shall depart in peace, for we have seen God's
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, believers already enjoy peace as much as ever Simeon did. No
          man can depart in peace who has not lived in peace; but he who has
          attained peace in life shall possess peace in death, and an eternity
          of peace after death. |Being justified by faith we have peace with God
          through our Lord Jesus Christ.| Jesus has bequeathed us peace, saying,
          |Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.| |For he is our
          peace,| and |the fruit of the Spirit is peace.| We are reconciled unto
          God by the death of his Son. Whatever peace flowed in the heart of
          Simeon, I am sure it was not of a diviner nature than that which
          dwells in the bosom of every true believer. If sin be pardoned, the
          quarrel is ended; if the atonement is made, then is peace established,
          a peace covenanted to endure for ever. We are now led in the paths of
          peace; we walk the King's highway, of which it is written, |no lion
          shall be there;| we are led beside the still waters, and made to lie
          down in green pastures. We feel no slavish fear of God, though he be
          |a consuming fire| even to us; we tremble no longer to approach into
          his presence, who deigns to be our Father. The precious blood upon the
          mercy-seat has made it a safe place for us to resort at all times;
          boldness has taken the place of trembling. The throne of God is our
          rejoicing, though once it was our terror.
        </p>
        <p>|Once twas a seat of dreadful wrath,</p>
        <p>And shot devouring flame;</p>
        <p>Our God appear'd consuming fire,'</p>
        <p>And vengeance was his name.|</p>
        <p>
          Therefore, brethren, having peace with God, we may be sure that we
          shall |depart in peace.| We need not fear that the God of all
          consolation, who has already enriched us in communion with himself,
          and peace in Christ Jesus, will desert us at the last. He will help us
          to sing a sweet swan-song, and our tabernacle shall be gently taken
          down, to be rebuilt more enduringly in the fair country beyond Jordan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we may rest assured of the same peace as that which
          Simeon possessed, since we are, if true believers, equally God's
          servants. The text says, |Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
          peace.| But, in this case, one servant cannot claim a privilege above
          the rest of the household. The same position towards God, the same
          reward from God. Simeon, a servant; you also, my brother, a servant;
          he who saith to Simeon, |depart in peace,| will say also the same to
          you. The Lord is always very considerate towards his old servants, and
          takes care of them when their strength faileth. The Amalekite of old
          had a servant who was an Egyptian, and when he fell sick he left him,
          and he would have perished if David had not had compassion on him; but
          our God is no Amalekite slave-owner, neither doth he cast off his
          wornout servants. |Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar
          hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will
          carry, and will deliver you.| David felt this, for he prayed to God,
          and said, |Now, also, when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me
          not.| If thou hast been clothed in thy Lord's livery of grace, and
          taught to obey his will, he will never leave thee, nor forsake thee;
          he will not sell thee into the hands of thine adversary, nor suffer
          thy soul to perish. A true master counts it a part of his duty to
          protect his servants, and our great Lord and Prince will show himself
          strong on the behalf of the very least of all his followers, and will
          bring them every one into the rest which remaineth for his people. Do
          you really serve God? Remember, |his servants ye are to whom ye obey.|
          Are ye taught of the Spirit to obey the commandments of love? Do you
          strive to walk in holiness? If so, fear not death; it shall have no
          terrors to you. All the servants of God shall depart in peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also another reflection which strengthens our conviction that
          all believers shall depart in peace, namely, this: that up till now
          all things in their experience have been according to God's word.
          Simeon's basis of hope for a peaceful departure was |according to thy
          word;| and, surely, no Scripture is of private interpretation, or to
          be reserved for one believer to the exclusion of the rest? The
          promises of God, which are |Yea and amen in Christ Jesus,| are sure to
          all the seed: not to some of the children is the promise made, but all
          the grace-born are heirs. There are not special promises hedged round
          and set apart for Simeon and a few saints of old time, but with all
          who are in Christ, their federal head, the covenant is made, and
          stands |ordered in all things and sure.| If, then, Simeon, as a
          believer in the Lord, had a promise that he should depart in peace, I
          have also a like promise if I am in Christ. What God hath said in his
          word Simeon lays hold of, and none can say him nay; but if, with the
          same grace-given faith, I also grasp it for myself, who shall
          challenge my right? God will not violate his promise to one of his
          people any more than to another, and, consequently, when our turn
          shall come to gather up our feet in the bed and to resign our spirit,
          some precious passage in sacred writ shall be as a rod and a staff to
          us that we may fear no evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          These four considerations, gathered out of the text itself, may give
          fourfold certainty to the assurance that every believer, at the hour
          of his departure, shall possess peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, review attentively the words of the aged saint: they
          have much instruction in them. Every believer shall in death depart in
          the same sense as Simeon did. The word here used is suggestive and
          encouraging: it may be applied either to escape from confinement, or
          to deliverance from toil. The Christian man in the present state is
          like a bird in a cage: his body imprisons his soul. His spirit, it is
          true, ranges heaven and earth, and laughs at the limits of matter,
          space, and time; but for all that, the flesh is a poor scabbard
          unworthy of the glittering soul, a mean cottage unfit for a princely
          spirit, a clog, a burden, and a fetter. When we would watch and pray,
          we find full often that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
          |We that are in this body do groan.| The fact is, we are caged birds;
          but the day cometh when the great Master shall open the cage door, and
          release his prisoners. We need not dread the act of unfastening the
          door, for it will give to our soul the liberty for which it only
          pines, and then, with the wings of a dove, covered with silver, and
          its feathers with yellow gold, though aforetime it had lien among the
          pots, it will soar into its native air, singing all the way with a
          rapture beyond imagination. Simeon looked upon dying as a mode of
          being let loose -- a deliverance out of durance vile, an escape from
          captivity, a release from bondage. The like redemption shall be dealt
          unto us. How often does my soul feel like an unhatched chick, shut up
          within a narrow shell, in darkness and discomfort! The life within
          labors hard to chip and break the shell, to know a little more of the
          great universe of truth, and see in clearer light the infinite of
          divine love. Oh, happy day, when the shell shall be broken, and the
          soul, complete in the image of Christ, shall enter into the freedom
          for which she is preparing! We look for that, and we shall have it.
          God, who gave us to aspire to holiness and spirituality and to
          likeness to himself, never implanted those aspirations in us out of
          mockery. He meant to gratify these holy longings, or, else, he would
          not have excited them. Ere long we, like Simeon, shall depart -- that
          is, we shall be set free to go in peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I said that the word meant also a release from toil. It is as though
          Simeon had been standing at the table of his Master like a servant
          waiting on his Lord. You know the parable in which Christ says that
          the master does not first bid his servant sit down and eat bread, but
          commands him thus, |Gird thyself and serve me.| See then, Simeon
          stands yonder, girt and serving his Master; but by-and-by, when the
          Master sees fit, he turns round and says to Simeon, |Now thou mayest
          depart, and take thine own meat, thy work is done.| Or, we may use
          another simile, and picture Simeon sitting at the King's gate, like
          Mordecai, ready for any errand which may be appointed him, but at
          length his time of attendance expires, and the great monarch bids him
          depart in peace. Or, yet again, we may view him as a reaper toiling
          amid the harvest beneath a burning sun, parched with thirst and
          wearied with labor, and lo! the great Boaz came into the field, and,
          having saluted his servant, says to him, |Thou hast fulfilled like an
          hireling thy day: take thou thy wage, and depart in peace.| The like
          shall happen to all true servants of Christ; they shall rest from
          their labors where no weariness shall vex them, |neither shall the sun
          light on them, nor any heat.| They shall enter into the joy of their
          Lord, and enjoy the rest which remaineth for them. There is much of
          comfortable thought if we meditate upon this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, note the words again. You perceive that the departure of the
          child of God is appointed of the Lord. |Now lettest thou thy servant
          depart.| The servant must not depart from his labor without his
          Masters permission, else would he be a runaway, dishonest to his
          position. The good servant dares not stir till his Master says,
          |Depart in peace.| Simeon was content to wait till he received
          permission to depart, and it becomes us all to acquiesce cheerfully in
          the Lord's appointment, whether he lengthens or shortens, our life. It
          is certain that without the Lord's will no power can remove us. No
          wind from the wilderness shall drive our souls into the land of
          darkness, no fiends with horrid clamor can drag us down to the abyss
          beneath, no destruction that wasting at noonday, or pestilence waiting
          in darkness can cut short our mortal career. We shall not die till God
          shall say to us, |My child, depart from the field of service, and the
          straitness of this thy tabernacle, and enter into rest.| Till God
          commands us we cannot die, and when he bids us go it shall be sweet
          for us to leave this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, further, that the words before us clearly show that the
          believer's departure is attended with a renewal of this divine
          benediction. |Depart in peace,| saith God. It is a farewell, such as
          we give to a friend: it is a benediction, such as Aaron, the priest of
          God, might pronounce over a suppliant whose sacrifice was accepted.
          Eli said unto Hannah, |Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee
          thy petition that thou hast asked of him.| Around the sinner's
          death-bed the tempest thickens, and he hears the rumblings of the
          eternal storm: his soul is driven away, either amid the thunderings of
          curses loud and deep, or else in the dread calm which evermore
          forebodes the hurricane. |Depart, ye cursed,| is the horrible sound
          which is in his ears. But, not so the righteous. He feels the Father's
          hand of benediction on his head, and underneath him are the
          everlasting arms. The best wine with him is kept to the last. At
          eventide it is light; and, as his sun is going down, it grows more
          glorious, and lights up all the surroundings with a celestial glow,
          whereat bystanders wonder, and exclaim |Let me die the death of the
          righteous, and let my last end be like his.| That pilgrim sets out
          upon a happy journey to whom Jehovah saith, |Depart in peace.| This is
          a sole finger laid upon the closing eyelid by a tender father, and it
          ensures a happy waking, where eyes are never wet with tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot detain you longer over these words: suffice it to add, that
          whatever belonged to Simeon in this benediction must not be regarded
          as peculiar to him alone, but as, in their measure, the possession of
          all believers. |This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and
          their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, secondly, we remind you, that SOME BELIEVERS ARE
          CONSCIOUS OF A SPECIAL READINESS TO DEPART IN PEACE.
        </p>
        <p>
          When do they feel this? Answer: first, when their graces are vigorous.
          All the graces are in all Christians, but they are not all there in
          the same proportion, nor are they at all times in the same degree of
          strength. In certain believers faith is strong and active. Now, when
          faith becomes |the evidence of things not seen,| and |the substance of
          things hoped for,| then the soul is sure to say, |Lord, now lettest
          thou thy servant depart in peace.| Faith brings the clusters of Eschol
          into the desert, and makes the tribes long for the land that floweth
          with milk and honey. When the old Gauls had drunk of the wines of
          Italy, they said, |Let us cross the Alps, and take possession of the
          vineyards, which yield such generous draughts.| So, when faith makes
          us realize the joy's of heaven, then it is that our soul stands
          waiting on the wing, watching for the signal from the glory-land.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is true of the grace of hope, for hope peers into the things
          invisible. She brings near to us the golden gates of the Eternal City.
          Like Moses, our hope climbs to the top of Pisgah, and beholds the
          Canean of the true Israel. Moses had a delightful vision of the
          promised land when he gazed from Nebo's brow, and saw it all from Dan
          to Beersheba: so also hope drinks in the charming prospect of the
          goodly fund and Lebanon, and then she exclaims exultingly, |Lord, now
          lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.| Heaven realised and
          anticipated by hope renders the thought of departure most precious to
          the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the like, also, is the effect of the grace of love upon us. Love
          puts the heart, like a sacrifice, on the altar, and then she fetches
          heavenly fire, and kindles it; and, as soon as ever the heart begins
          to burn and glow like a sacrifice, what is the consequence? Why, it
          ascends like pillars of smoke up to the throne of God. It is the very
          instinct of love to draw us nearer to the person whom we love; and,
          when love towards God pervades the soul, then the spirit cries, |Make
          haste, my beloved, be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
          mountains of separation.| Perfect love, casting out all fear, cries,
          |Up, and away.|
        </p>
        <p>|Let me be with thee, where thou art,</p>
        <p>My Savior my eternal rest!</p>
        <p>Then only will this longing heart</p>
        <p>Be fully and for ever blest.|</p>
        <p>
          I might thus mention all the graces, but suffer one of them to
          suffice! one which is often overlooked, but is priceless as the gold
          of Ophir -- it is the grace of humility. Is it strange that the lower
          a man sinks in his own esteem the higher does he rise before his God?
          Is it not written, |Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
          kingdom of heaven?| Simeon had no conceit of his own importance in the
          world, else he would have said, |Lord, let me stay, and be an apostle.
          Surely I shall be needed at this juncture to lend my aid in the
          auspicious era which has just commenced?| But no, he felt himself so
          little so inconsiderable, that now that he had attained his heart's
          wish and seen God's salvation, he was willing to depart in peace.
          Humility by making us lie low helps us to think highly of God, and,
          consequently, to desire much to be with God. O to have our graces
          always flourishing, for then shall we always be ready to depart, and
          willing to be offered up. Lack of grace entangles us, but to abound in
          grace is to live in the suburbs of the New Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another time, when believers are thus ready to go, is when their
          assurance is clear. It is not always so with even the most mature
          Christians, and some true saints have not yet attained to assurance;
          they are truly saved, and possess a genuine faith, but as assurance is
          the cream of faith, the milk has not stood long enough to produce the
          cream; they have not yet come to the flower of assurance, for their
          faith is but a tender plant. Give a man assurance of heaven and he
          will be eager to enjoy it. While he doubts his own security, he wants
          to linger here. He is like the Psalmist when he asked that God would
          permit him to recover his strength before he went hence, and was no
          more. Some things were not yet in order with David, and he would stay
          awhile till they were. But, when the ship is all loaded, the crew on
          board, and the anchor heaved, the favoring breeze is desired that the
          barque may speed on its voyage. When a man is prepared for his
          journey, ready to depart, he does not care to linger long in these
          misty valleys, but pants for the sunny summits of the mount of God,
          whereon standeth the palace of the Great King. Let a man know that he
          is resting upon the precious blood of Christ, let him by diligent
          self-examination perceive in himself the marks of regeneration, and by
          the witness of his own spirit and by the infallible witness of the
          Holy Ghost bearing witness with his own spirit, let him be certified
          that he is born of God, and the natural consequence will be that he
          will say, |Now let me loose from all things here below and let me
          enter into the rest which is assuredly my own.| O you that have lost
          your assurance by negligent living, by falling into sin, or by some
          other form of backsliding, I do not wonder that you hug the world, for
          you are afraid you have no other portion; but with those who read
          their titles clear to mansions in the skies it will be otherwise. They
          will not ask to linger in this place of banishment, but will sing in
          their hearts, as we did just now:
        </p>
        <p>|Jerusalem my happy home,</p>
        <p>Name ever dear to me;</p>
        <p>when shall my labors have an end,</p>
        <p>In joy and peace and thee?|</p>
        <p>
          Beloved, furthermore, saints feel most their readiness to go when
          their communion with Christ is near and sweet; when Christ hides
          himself we are afraid to talk of dying, or of heaven; but, when he
          only shows himself through the lattices, and we can see those eyes
          which are |as the eyes of doves by the rivers of water, washed with
          milk and fitly set;| when our own soul melteth even at that hazy sight
          of him, as through a glass darkly. Oh then we fain would be at home,
          and our soul crieth out for the day when her eyes shall see the King
          in his beauty, in the land that is very far off. Have you never felt
          the heavenly homesickness? Have you never pined for the home-bringing?
          Surely, when your heart has been full of the bridegroom's beauty, and
          your soul has been ravished with his dear and ever precious love, you
          have said: |When shall the day break, and the shadows flee away? Why
          are his chariots so long in coming?| You have swooned, as it were,
          with love-sickness for your precious Savior, thirsting to see him as
          he is, and to be like him. The world is black when Christ is fair; it
          is a poor heap of ashes when he is altogether lovely to us. When a
          precious Christ is manifested to our spirits, we feel that we could
          see Jesus and die. Put out these eyes, there is nothing more for them
          to see when they have seen him. |Black sun,| said Rutherford, |black
          moon, black stars, but inconceivably bright and glorious Lord Jesus.|
          How often did that devout man write words of this sort: |Oh if I had
          to swim through seven hells to reach him, if he would but say to me,
          like Peter, Come unto me,' I would go unto him not only on the sea,
          but on the boiling floods of hell, if I might but reach him, and come
          to him.| I will pause here and give you his own words: |I profess to
          you I have no rest, I have no ease, till I be over head and ears in
          love's ocean. If Christ's love (that fountain of delight) were laid as
          open to me as I would wish, Oh, how I would drink, and drink
          abundantly.! I half call his absence cruel; and the mask and veil on
          Christ's face a cruel covering that hideth such a fair, fair face from
          a sick soul. I dare not upbraid him, but his absence is a mountain of
          iron upon my heavy heart. Oh, when shall we meet? Oh, how long is it
          to the dawning of the marriage day? O sweet Lord Jesus, take wide
          steps; O my Lord, come over the mountains at one stride! O my Beloved,
          be like a roe, or a young hart, on the mountains of separation. Oh, if
          he would fold the heavens together like an old cloak, and shovel time
          and days out of the way, and make ready in haste the Lamb's wife for
          her Husband! Since he looked upon me my heart is not mine; he hath run
          away to heaven with it.| When these strong throes, these ardent pangs
          of insatiable desire come upon a soul that is fully saturated with
          Christ's love, through having been made to lean its head upon his
          bosom, and to receive the kisses of his mouth, then is the time when
          the soul saith, |Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.|
        </p>
        <p>
          So again, beloved, saints have drawn their anchor up and spread their
          sails, when they have been made to hold loose by all there is in this
          world; and that is generally when they hold fastest by the world to
          come. To many this world is very sweet, very fair, but God puts
          bitters into the cup of his children; when their nest is soft, he
          fills it with thorns to make them long to fly. Alas, that it should be
          so, but some of God's servants seem as if they had made up their minds
          to find a rest beneath the moon. They are moon-struck who hope to do
          so. All the houses in this plague-stricken land are worm-eaten and let
          in the rain and wind: my soul longeth to find a rest among the ivory
          palaces of thy land, O Immanuel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, it often happens that the loss of dear friends, or the
          treachery of those we trusted, or bodily sickness, or depression of
          spirit, may help to unloose the holdfasts which enchain us to this
          life; and then we are enabled to say with David in one of the most
          precious little Psalms in the whole Book, the 131st, |I have behaved
          and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is
          even as a weaned child.| I have often thought that if David had said,
          |my soul is even as a weaning child,| it would have been far more like
          most of God's people. But to be weaned, quite weaned from the world,
          to turn away from her consolations altogether, this it is which makes
          us cry, |Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.| Even as
          the psalmist when he said, |And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is
          in thee.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, saints are willing to depart when their work is almost done.
          This will not be the case with many here present, perhaps, but it was
          so with Simeon. Good old man! He had been very constant in his
          devotions, but on this occasion he came into the temple, and there, it
          is said, he took the child in his arms, and blessed God. Once more he
          delivered his soul of its adoration -- once more he blended his praise
          with the songs of angels. When he had done that, he openly confessed
          his faith: another important work of every believer -- for he said,
          |Mine eyes have seen thy salvation.| He bore public testimony to the
          child Jesus, and declared that he should be |a light to lighten the
          Gentiles.| Having done that, he bestowed his fatherly benediction upon
          the child's parents, Joseph and his mother; he blessed them, and said
          unto Mary |Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
          many in Israel.| Now, we read that David, after he had served his
          generation, fell on sleep; it is time for man to sleep when his life's
          work is finished. Simeon felt he had done all: he had blessed God; he
          had declared his faith; he had borne testimony to Christ; he had
          bestowed his benediction upon godly people; and so he said, |Now,
          Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.| Ah, Christian people,
          you will never be willing to go if you are idle. You lazy lie-a-beds,
          who do little or nothing for Christ, you sluggish servants, whose
          garden is overgrown with weeds, no wonder that you do not want to see
          your master! Your sluggishness accuses you, and makes you cowards.
          Only he who has put out his talents to good interest will be willing
          to render an account of his stewardship. But when a man feels, without
          claiming any merit, that he has fought a good fight, finished his
          course, and kept the faith, then will he rejoice in the crown which is
          laid up for him in heaven, and he will long to wear it. Throw your
          strength into the Lord's work, dear brethren -- all your strength;
          spare none of your powers: let body, soul, and spirit be entirely
          consecrated to God, and used at their utmost stretch. Get through your
          day's work, for the sooner you complete it, and have fulfilled like an
          hireling your day, the more near and sweet shall be the time when the
          shadows lengthen, and God shall say to you, as a faithful servant,
          |Depart in peace!|
        </p>
        <p>
          One other matter, I think, helps to make saints willing to go, and
          that is when they see or foresee the prosperity of the church of God.
          Good old Simeon saw that Christ was to be a light to lighten the
          Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people Israel; and, therefore, he
          said, |Lord, lettest now thy servant depart in peace.| I have known
          many a godly deacon who has seen a church wither and decay, its
          ministry become unprofitable, and its membership become divided; the
          dear old man has poured out his soul in agony before God, and when at
          last the Lord has sent a man to seek the good of Israel, and the
          church has been built up, he has been overjoyed, and he has said, |now
          lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.| It must have reconciled
          John Knox to die when he had seen the reformation safely planted
          throughout all Scotland. It made dear old Latimer, as he stood on the
          fagot, feel happy when he could say, |Courage, brother, we shall this
          day light such a candle in England as shall never be blown out.| |Pray
          for the peace of Jerusalem,| Ay, that we do, and we vehemently desire
          her prosperity, and if we can see Christ glorified, error defeated,
          truth established, sinners saved, and saints sanctified our spirit
          feels she has all she wishes. Like dying, David, when we have said,
          |Let the whole earth be filled with his glory,| we can fall back upon
          the pillows and die, for our prayers like those of David the son of
          Jesse are ended. Let us pray for this peace and this prosperity, and
          when we see it come, it shall bring calm and rest to our spirits, so
          that we shall be willing to depart in peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall call your attention now, for a little while, to the third
          point, that THERE ARE WORDS TO ENCOURAGE US TO THE LIKE READINESS TO
          DEPART. |According to thy word.| Now let us go to the Bible, and take
          from it seven choice words all calculated to cheer our hearts in the
          prospect of departure, and the first is Psalm 33:4; |Yea, though I
          walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
          for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.| |We
          walk| -- the Christian does not quicken his pace when he dies; he
          walked before, and he is not afraid of death, so he calmly walks on.
          It is a walk through a |shadow.| There is no substance in death, it is
          only a shade. Who needs fear a shadow? It is not a lonely walk --
          |Thou art with me.| Neither is it a walk that need cause us terror; |I
          will fear no evil:| not only is there no evil, but no fear shall cloud
          my dying hours. It shall be a departure full of comfort: |Thy rod and
          thy staff| -- a duplicate means shall give us a fullness of
          consolation. |Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another text, and so follow the direction, |According to thy
          word.| Psalm 37:37: |Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for
          the end of that man is peace.| If we are perfect, that is sincere; if
          we are upright, that is honest in heart; our end then assuredly be
          peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another word, Psalm 116:15: |Precious in the sight of the Lord is
          the death of his saints.| It is no ordinary thing for a saint to die;
          it is a spectacle which the eyes of God are delighted with. As king's
          delight in their pearls and diamonds, and count them precious, so the
          death-beds of the saints are God's precious things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another, Isaiah 57:2: |He shall enter into peace: they shall rest
          in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.| Here is an
          entrance into peace for the saint, rest on his dying, bed, rest for
          his body in the grave, rest for his spirit in the bosom of his Lord,
          and a walking in his uprightness in the immortality above. |According
          to thy word.| Oh, what force there is in these few syllables! When you
          can preach the word of God you must prevail. Nothing has such marrow
          and fatness in it as a text of Scripture. It has a force of comfort
          all its own. Consider also 1 Corinthians 3:22: |For all things are
          your's: whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
          death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's.| Now, if
          death is yours, there can be no sort of reason why you should be
          afraid of that which is made over to you as a part of your
          inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the fifteenth chapter and fifty-fourth verse of the same epistle:
          |So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
          mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
          the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death,
          where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death
          is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God,
          which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.| With such
          a text we need not fear to depart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so that other word, the seventh we shall quote, and in that number
          seven dwelleth perfection of testimony. Revelation 14:13: |And I heard
          a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which
          die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may
          rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I dare say, many of you have said, |I wish I had a word from God,
          just like Simeon had, to cheer me in my dying moments.| You have it
          before you; here are seven that I have read to you, most sure words of
          testimony, unto which you do well to take heed, as unto a light
          shining in a dark place. These promises belong to all believers in our
          precious Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Fear not, then, be not afraid,
          but rather say, |How lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done the sermon, but we must put a rider to it. Just a word or
          two to those of you who cannot die in peace because you are not
          believers in Christ: you have never seen God's salvation, neither are
          you God's servants. I must deal with you as I have dealt with the
          saints. I have given them texts of Scripture, for the text saith,
          |according to thy word;| and I will give you also two passages of
          Scripture, which will show you those who may not hope to depart in
          peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first one is negative: it shows who cannot enter heaven, and,
          consequently, who cannot depart in peace.1 Corinthians 6:9: |Know ye
          not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?| the
          unjust, the oppressive, cheats, rogues, |the unrighteous shall not
          inherit the kingdom of God.| I will read these words. I need not
          explain them, but let every one here who comes under their lash submit
          to God's word. |Be not deceived: neither fornicators,| -- plenty of
          them in London -- |nor idolaters,| -- and ye need not worship a God of
          wood and stone to be idolaters, worship anything but God, you are an
          idolater -- |nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
          with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,| -- alas, some
          of these come to this house regularly, -- |nor revilers,| that is,
          backbiters!, cavillers, tale-bearers, swearers, and such like, |nor
          extortioners,| -- you fine twenty percent gentlemen! You who grind
          poor borrowers with usurious interest. None of you shall inherit the
          kingdom of God, not one of you. If you come within this list, except
          God renew your hearts and change you, the holy gates of heaven are
          shut in your face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, take another text, of a positive character, from the Book of
          Revelation 21:7: |He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I
          will be his God, and he shall be my son. But the fearful,| -- that
          means the cowardly, those that are ashamed of Christ, those that dare
          not suffer for Christ's sake, those who believe everything, and
          nothing, and so deny the truth, because they cannot endure to be
          persecuted; |the fearful and unbelieving,| -- that is, those who do
          not trust a Savior -- |and the abominable,| -- and they are not
          scarce, some among the poor are abominable, and there are Right
          Honourables who ought to be called Right Abominables; ay, and greater
          than that, too, whose vices make them abominable to the nation: and
          |murderers,| -- |he that hateth his brother is a murderer;| and
          |whoremongers and sorcerers;| |those who have or pretend to have
          dealings with devils and spirits, your spirit rappers, the whole batch
          of them; |and idolaters, and all liars,| and these swarm everywhere,
          they lie in print, and they lie with the voice; |all liars shall have
          their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is
          the second death.|

          Now, these are no words of mine, but the words of God; and if they
          condemn you, you are condemned; but, if you be condemned, fly to
          Jesus. Repent and be converted, as saith the gospel, and forgiveness
          shall be yours, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

          Our usual Penny Almanack is now ready, and we hope it will be as much
          approved of as its predecessors have been. We have also with no small
          labor, written an Almanack for the walls, which is called John
          Ploughman's Sheet Almanack. Our friends tells us that it will have an
          unprecedented sale, and we only hope it may, but not to the detriment
          of the older one. They are quite distinct things, and very different
          in all respects, except that they are by the same author, cost the
          same price -- one penny, and can be had of the same publishers,
          Messrs. Passmore and Alabaster. -- C. H. S.<br />
