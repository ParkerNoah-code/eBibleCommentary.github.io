        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
          perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice,
          Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.| -- Acts 14:9-10.
        </p>
        <p>
          I HAVE READ in your hearing the story of the preaching of Paul and
          Barnabas in the town of Lystra. The name of Christ was there totally
          unknown. They were a sort of country people, partly pastoral and
          partly agricultural, who seem to have been deeply sunken in
          superstition. At the gates of their city there stood a great temple
          dedicated to Jupiter, and they appear to have been his zealous
          votaries. Coming down from the mountain-side Paul and Barnabas enter
          the town, and when a fitting time has come, they stand up in the
          marketplace, or the street, and begin to talk concerning Jesus, the
          Son of God, who had come down from heaven, had suffered and died, and
          had again ascended up on high. The people gather round them. Among the
          rest a cripple listens with very marked attention. They preach again.
          The crowds are still greater, and on one occasion, while Paul is in
          the middle of a sermon, using his eyes to watch the audience as all
          preachers should do, and not looking up at the ceiling, or at the
          gallery-front as some preachers are wont to do, he marks this cripple,
          fixes his eyes upon him, and looks earnestly in his face. Either by
          the exercise of his judgment, or by the promptings of revelation, the
          apostle gathers that this man has faith -- faith to be healed. In
          order to attract the attention of the people, to glorify the name of
          Christ, to publish more widely his glorious fame, and to make the
          miracle well known, Paul stops the sermon, and with a loud voice
          cries, |Stand upright on thy feet.| The cripple leaps and praises God.
          The population are all amazed, and knowing that there was a tradition
          that Jupiter and Mercury had once appeared in that very town, a
          tradition preserved in the Metamorphoses of Ovid to the present day,
          they at once conclude that surely Jupiter and Mercury must be come
          again. They fix upon Barnabas, who was probably the elder and the
          nobler looking man, for Jupiter; and as Jupiter was always attended by
          Mercurins, as a messenger, and Mercury was the god of eloquence, they
          conclude that Paul must be Mercury. They rush to the temple, they tell
          the priests that the gods have come down. The priests, only too ready
          to foster popular credulity, and pander to it, bring forth the sacred
          bullocks and the garlands, and are about to offer sacrifice before
          Paul and Barnabas. Such homage these men of God indignantly refuse;
          they rend their clothes; they beseech them to do no such thing, for
          they are nothing but men; yet hardly with earnest words can they stay
          the people. But the next day certain Jews came thither and produced a
          counter irritation in the simple minds of the people. No very
          difficult task where a rude fanaticism rouses the wild passions of the
          mob. Such an assembly must rage, whether it he with redundant applause
          or with derisive jeers. Accordingly, Paul finds himself exposed to
          peril; he is stoned through the streets, dragged forth as dead, and
          left by the very men who worshipped him but yesterday as a god, left
          to die as a villain outside the city gates. But Paul's preaching had
          not been in vain. There were some few disciples who remained faithful.
          His ministry was rewarded and owned of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two or three points in this narrative to which I shall call
          your attention to-night, making, however, the lame man the center of
          the picture. We shall notice, first of all, what preceded this lame
          man's faith; secondly, wherein lay his faith to be healed; and
          thirdly, what is the teaching of the miracle itself, and the blessing
          which the lame man obtained through faith.
        </p>
        <p>I. WHAT WAS IT WHICH PRECEDED HIS FAITH?</p>
        <p>
          That |Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,| is a
          great and universal rule; but the hearing of what? Doubtless the
          hearing of the gospel is intended. On turning to your Bibles you will
          find it is written -- |And there they preached the gospel.| What,
          Paul, dost thou not change thy voice? Thou hast preached the gospel in
          the cities of Iconium and Antioch, where there were enlightened and
          intelligent hearers; if the gospel suited them, surely it will not do
          for these wolfish boors! Why go and preach to these poor, ignorant,
          superstitious fanatics the very same truths which you spoke to your
          enlightened Jewish brethren? But he does do so, my friends. The very
          gospel which he preached at Damascus in the synagogue he preaches here
          at Lystra in the market-place. He makes no difference between the
          education of his hearers in different places; he has the same gospel
          to preach to them both. You recollect that Paul went to Ephesus, and
          Ephesus, as a city, was besotted with a belief in sorcery. The people
          had given themselves up to practice magical arts. What is the right
          way to begin to preach at Ephesus? Deliver a course of lectures upon
          the impossibility and absurdity of such superstition? No, sir, nothing
          of the kind. Preach Christ, preach the gospel; and as Jesus Christ is
          lifted up they bring their magical books and make a bonfire of them in
          the open forum. But here is a polished governor, Sergius Paulus,
          sitting upon the judgment-seat. What shall be preached to him? Would
          it not be well to begin with a dissertation on politics, and to show
          that the Christian religion does not interfere with proper government,
          that it does not stir up the people to anarchy? No, sir, nothing of
          the kind. There is nothing for Sergius Paulus any more than there is
          for Elymas the sorcerer, but the preaching of the gospel of Jesus
          Christ. Paul goes to Athens. Now the Athenians are the most learned
          and philosophical of the whole race of men. What will Paul preach
          there? The gospel, the whole gospel, and nothing but the gospel. He
          may change his tones, but never his matter. It is the same remedy for
          the same disease, he the men what they may. He comes to Corinth, and
          here you have not only polished manners, but the very refinement of
          vice. It is a city, an emporium of trade, and a sort of central depot
          of sin. What then? Will he now, to please the trader, assume a
          different dialect? Not he! The Christ for Athens is the Christ for
          Corinth too. And now see him. He has come to Lycaonia, and is
          preaching at Lystra. Here is an ignorant set of people who worship an
          image. Why does he not begin by preaching of the deity? Why does he
          not talk to them of the Trinity in unity? Why does he not try and
          confute their notions about their gods? No, my dear sir, he will do
          nothing of the kind; that may be done incidentally, but the first and
          the last thing that Paul will do at Lystra is, there he will preach
          the gospel. O glorious gospel of the blessed God! Wherever we take
          thee thou art suited to the wants of men. Take thee to Persia with all
          its gems and jewels, and thou dost suit the monarch on his throne; or
          take thee to the naked savage with all his poverty and squalid filth,
          and thou dost suit him too. Thou mayst he preached, thrice glorious
          wisdom of God, to the wisest of men; but thou are not too great a
          mystery to be understood and believed even by the fools and the babes;
          the things which are not can receive thee as well as the things which
          are. Never, I pray you brethren, lose heart in the power of the
          gospel. Do not believe that there exists any man, much less any race
          of men, for whom the gospel is not fitted. Wherever you go, do not
          cut, and trim, and shape, and alter; hut just bring out the whole
          truth as God has taught it to you, and rest assured that you will be
          unto God a sweet savor of Christ in every place, both in them who are
          saved and in them who perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then, was this gospel which the apostle Paul did preach
          everywhere? Well, it was a gospel which had in it three things,
          certain facts, certain doctrines, and certain commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a gospel of facts. Every time Paul stood up to preach he told
          the following unvarnished tale: God, looking upon the race of men,
          beheld them lost and ruined. Out of love to them he sent his only
          begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of the virgin Mary,
          lived some thirty-two or thirty-three years a life of spotless
          innocence and perfect obedience to God. He was God: he was man. In due
          time he was delivered up by the traitor Judas. He was crucified, and
          actually put to death. Though he was the Lord of life and glory, who
          only hath immortality, yet he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.
          After three days he rose again, and showed himself to many of his
          disciples, so that they were well assured he was the same person who
          had been put into the grave; and when the forty days were finished he
          ascended up to heaven in the sight of them all, where he sitteth at
          the right hand of God, and shall also come ere long a second time to
          judge both the quick and the dead. These were the facts which Paul
          would state. God was made flesh and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld
          his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the father, full of
          grace and truth. |This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
          whom I am chief.| Briefly, these were the facts which Paul would
          preach, and if any one of these facts he preached doubtfully, or he
          left out of any ministry, then the gospel is not preached; for the
          foundations upon which the gospel rests have been removed, and then
          what can the righteous do?
        </p>
        <p>
          Following upon these facts, Paul preached certain doctrines, the
          doctrines flowing out of the facts. To wit, he preached that Jesus
          Christ had offered a full atonement to divine wrath for the sin of his
          people, so that whosoever would believe on him, and trust him, should
          be saved. The doctrine of the atonement would form the most prominent
          feature in the gospel of the apostle Paul, Christ also hath suffered
          for us, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God. |God commendeth
          his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died
          for the ungodly.| Then would come the doctrine of pardon. Paul with
          glowing tongue would tell how God could be just, and yet the justifier
          of him who believeth; how all manner of sin and iniquity shall be
          forgiven unto men, the simple condition being that the man believes in
          Christ, and this not so much the man's own work, as a gift of the Holy
          Ghost. Everywhere Paul would he unmistakable in this -- |Ye chief of
          sinners, look to the wounds of Jesus, and your sins shall he forgiven
          you.| Equally clear would he be upon the doctrine of justification.
          |Christ,| he would say, |will wash you; nay, more, he will clothe you;
          the perfect holiness of his character shall he imputed unto you, and
          being justified, you shall have peace with God, and there shall be no
          condemnation, because you are in Christ Jesus.| I think I see the
          flashing eye of the apostle; methinks I listen to his earnest voice,
          while he pleads with men to lay hold upon eternal life, to look to
          Jesus Christ, to forsake the deeds of the law, to put their trust in
          nothing which cometh from man, but to look to Jesus, and to Jesus
          only. These great truths, atonement, pardon, and justification, with
          all the other truths connected with them, of which we cannot now speak
          particularly, were just the gospel which the apostle Paul preached.
        </p>
        <p>
          And out of these we said their sprung certain commands. The commands
          were these -- |Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
          saved.| Nor do I suppose that the apostle for a moment stammered to
          preach that other command -- |Arise, and he baptized.| He would not
          preach half the gospel, but the whole of it -- |He that believeth and
          is baptized shall he saved; but he that believeth not shall he
          damned;| and often after his hearers had cried, |What must we do to he
          saved,| and they had believed in Christ, they would say to him --
          |See, here is water, what doth hinder me to he baptized?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle then preached a gospel which was made up of certain
          authenticated facts, out of which there flowed certain most gracious
          evangelical doctrines, which were enforced and driven home with divine
          authority, by Christ's own commands. |Well,| says one, |do you think
          the world will be turned upside down by this?| Sirs, it has been, and
          it will he again. In vain do those who seek after human learning, and
          who aim at dreamy sentiment or spurious science in preference to the
          standard teaching which is from above, attempt to find a nobler
          instrument. This is the great battering-ram which shall yet shake the
          bastions of error. This is the sword, the true Escalabar, which, if
          any man knoweth how to wield it, shall cut through joints and marrow,
          and make him more than a conqueror. He who getteth a hold of the
          gospel of Christ, and knoweth how to use it, hath that before which
          the devils tremble, and in the presence of which angels adore, which
          cherubs long to look into, and which God himself smiles upon as his
          noblest work. The truth we proclaim is not that which is discovered by
          us, but that which has been delivered to us. Do ye ask, then, where
          this man's faith came from? It came from Paul's preaching of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>II. Now WHEREIN LAY THIS MAN'S FAITH?</p>
        <p>
          Paul looked at the man, we are told, and perceived |that he had faith
          to be healed.| What meaneth this |faith to be healed?| In this man's
          case I think it was something like this. Poor fellow! As he listened
          to Paul's preaching, he thought perhaps -- |Well, that looks like
          true; that seems to be the truth; it is the truth; I am sure it is
          true; and, if it is true that Jesus Christ is so great a Savior,
          perhaps I may be healed; these lame legs of mine, which never would
          carry me anywhere, may yet come straight; I -- I -- I think they may;
          I hope they may; I believe they may; I know it can be done if Christ
          wills it; I believe that, and from what Paul says of Christ's
          character, I think he must be willing to do it; I will ask the
          apostle; the first convenient season that I have I will lift up my
          cry, for I believe it can be done, and I think there is a perfect
          willingness, both in the mind of the apostle and of the Master that it
          should be done; I believe it will be done, and that I shall yet stand
          upright.| Then Paul said to him, |Stand upright on thy feet,| and he
          did so in a moment, for |he had faith to he healed.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you think I am overstraining the probabilities of the case? You
          will perhaps say, |It does not appear that Paul had any communication
          with the poor cripple before the miracle was performed.| Now I venture
          to draw quite an opposite inference. I know from my own experience
          that it is no uncommon thing for some one individual to arrest the
          preacher's attention. The group of countenances which lay before him
          in a large assembly like the present, might to the first glance of a
          stranger look confused and inexplicable, as a Chinese grammar does to
          those who know not the language. But you need not doubt that a
          practiced eye can learn to read the one as well as the other. The
          languor and indifference of some; the curious enquiring look of
          others; the cold, critical attention of a considerable number, and the
          countenances of those who are rather absorbed in a train of thought
          just awakened in their own minds -- these have all a peculiar
          impressiveness, and form a picture which often reacts upon us, and
          kindles a vehement desire in our breasts to reach the souls of those
          who, for a brief hour, hang upon our lips. But there will sometimes be
          one who has faith dazzling in his very eyes, as they are fixed with an
          intentness, of which it were vain for me to attempt a description,
          seeming to drink in every word and every syllable of a word, till the
          preacher becomes as absorbed in that man as the man had been in the
          preacher. And while he pursues the discourse, gaining liberty at every
          step, till he forgets the formality of the pulpit in the freedom of
          conversation with the people, he perceives that at last this man has
          heard the very truth which meets his case. There is no concealing it.
          His features have suddenly relaxed. He listens still, but it is no
          longer with painful anxiety; a calm satisfaction is palpable on his
          face now. That soul of communion which is in the eye has unravelled
          the secret. Preacher and hearer, unknown to all the rest of the
          audience, have secretly saluted ench other, and met on the common
          ground of a vital faith. The anxious one feels that it can be done.
          And I can readily conclude that the apostle perceived that feeling
          with greater certainty than he would have done had the man whispered
          it in his ears. So have I sometimes known that the exhortation to
          believe has become from these lips a positive command to the
          struggling conscience of some one, who has been brought to a point
          where the remedy is instantly applied, and the cure instantly
          effected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most unquestionably there is such a thing as faith to be saved. I do
          not know how many here may possess it; but, thank God, there are
          hundreds of you here who have faith that you are saved. That is
          better; that is the ripest faith, the faith which knows you are saved
          and rejoices in hope of the glory of God. Alas! there are others who
          have no faith at all. But it is with those who have faith, and that
          only faith to be saved, not faith that you are saved, I am more
          particularly concerned at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I describe this |faith to he saved?| for I believe that there
          may be some here who may just now stand upright on their feet; some
          who may at this time leap for joy of heart because they are saved and
          did not know it. You have |faith,| but you have not fully exercised
          it. Now, you believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son? |Yes.| That he
          has made a full atonement for his people? |Yes.| You believe that they
          are his people who trust him? |Yes.| You believe he is worthy to be
          trusted? |Yes.| You have nothing else to trust to? |No, sir.| You
          depend on nothing which you have ever felt, or thought, or done? |No,
          sir, I depend on nothing but Christ.| And you do, after a sort of
          fashion, trust Christ. You hope that one of these days he will save
          you, and you think, and sometimes you almost know, he will. You are
          ready to trust him. You do believe he is able, you do not think he is
          unwilling; you have got faith in his ability, and you have almost got
          faith in his willingness; sometimes you half think to yourself, |I am
          a child of God.| But then, there is some ugly |but| comes in. Those
          lame legs again; those lame legs again. You are still afraid. You have
          |faith to he saved,| but you have not the full assurance of faith
          which can utter forth this joyous psalm, |Behold, God is my salvation;
          I will trust, and not he afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength
          and my song; he also is become my salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Well now, I do not know whether I have picked you out, whether I have
          given a right description of you or not. I recollect the time when I
          was in that state. I can honestly say I did not doubt Christ. I then
          partly believed that he would save me. I knew he was worthy of my
          trust, and I did trust him as far as this, that I resolved, if I did
          perish, I would perish crying to him, and that if I was east away, it
          should be clinging to the cross. I believe I had |faith to be saved,|
          and was for months in bondage, when there was no necessity that I
          should have been in bondage at all, for, when there is |faith to he
          saved,| then the man only needs that gracious command -- |Stand
          upright on thy feet,| and forthwith he leaps out of his infirmity, and
          walks freely in the integrity of his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall not enlarge further upon this, because I want to go to
          THE SPIRITUAL TEACHING OF THE MIRACLE, AND OF THE BLESSING CONFERRED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are there not many, who though they have |faith to be saved,| are
          still entirely lame or painfully limping? The reasons may be different
          in different cases. Some have been so stunned by the grief which they
          have suffered on account of sin, and the frightful convictions through
          which they have passed, that while they do believe that Christ is able
          and willing to save, they cannot get a hold of the fact that they are
          saved; such is the faintness of spirit and the languishing of soul
          brought on by long despair. |Stand upright on thy feet,| thou
          trembling sinner. If thou believest in Jesus, whatever thy fears may
          be, there is no cause for them. As for thy sins, they were laid on
          him, every one of them, and though thou hast been sore broken in the
          land of dragons, thus saith the Lord unto thee, |I have put away thy
          sin; thou shalt not die; I have blotted out like a cloud thy
          transgressions, and like a thick cloud thy sins.| Rejoice, then, and
          he glad. If you do trust Christ, you are saved; though as yet it only
          looketh like faith which heralds the tidings of a salvation which has
          not yet arrived. Still, it is the grace of God which bringeth
          salvation which has enabled thee to believe; and he who believeth on
          the Son bath everlasting life. O receive the welcome message; spring
          up at the sound of the words; stand upright on thy feet and rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some are still lame, though they have faith, through ignorance. They
          do not know what being saved is. They entertain wrong expectations.
          They are trusting in Christ, but they do not feel any surprising
          emotions; they have not had any remarkable dreams, or visions, or
          striking ebullitions of excited joy, and therefore, though they have
          |faith to be saved,| they have not the faith of a present salvation.
          They are waiting for something, they hardly know what, to embellish
          their faith, or to fortify it with signs and wonders. Now, poor soul,
          wherefore do you wait? These things are not necessary to salvation. In
          fact, the fewer you have of them, methinks, the better, especially of
          things which are visionary. I rather tremble for those who talk much
          about sensible evidences; they are too often the frivolities of
          unstable hearts. Beloved, though you may have never had any ecstatic
          joys, or suffered any deep depression of your spirits, if you are
          resting on Christ, it does not matter one whit what your feelings have
          been or have not been. Do you expect to have an electric shock, or to
          go through some mysterious operation? The operation is mysterious, too
          mysterious for you to discern it; but all that you have to do with is
          this -- |Do I believe in Jesus? Am I simply depending upon him for
          everything?| If you do you are saved, and I pray you to believe this.
          Stand upright on your feet, and leap for joy; for whether you believe
          it or not, if you are now depending upon Christ, your sins are
          forgiven you; you are a child of God; you are an heir of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many, too, are kept lame because of a fear of self-deception. |I
          do trust Christ, but I am afraid lest I should deceive myself; suppose
          I were to get confidence, and it should he presumption! suppose I
          should think myself saved, and I am not!| Now, sir, if thou wert
          dealing with thyself there would be reason to be afraid of
          presumption, but thy faith hath to deal with God, who cannot deceive
          thee, and with Christ who will never tempt thee to be a deceiver. Doth
          not the Lord Jesus Christ himself tell thee that if thou believest in
          him thou art saved? Thou believest that, dost thou not? Then, soul, if
          thou believest on him, it is not presumption to say, |I am saved.|
          Away with all that affectation of modesty, which some good people
          think to he so pretty -- saying, |I hope;| |I trust;| but |I feel such
          doubts, such fears, and such gloomy misgivings.| My dear sir, that is
          not humility: that is a vain unseemly questioning of God. The God and
          Father of our Lord Jesus Christ tells you, and he gives his own
          unequivocal word for it, that if you rest upon Christ you rest upon a
          rock; that if you believe in him you are not condemned. Is it an
          evidence of the lowliness of your heart that you suspect the veracity
          of God, or the faithfulness of his promise? Surely this were no fruit
          of the meekness of wisdom. No, beloved; it may seem too good to he
          true, but it is not too good for my God to give, though it is too good
          for you to receive. You have his word for it, that if you trust his
          Son to save you, and simply trust him, and him alone, even if the
          pillars of the heavens should shake, yet you would be saved. If the
          foundations of the earth should reel, and the whole earth should like
          a vision pass away, yet this eternal promise and oath of God must
          stand fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others again, cannot stand upright on their feet, because they are
          afraid that if they did begin they would go back again, and so bring
          dishonor to Christ. This would be a very proper fear if you had
          anything to do with keeping yourselves. If you had to carry yourselves
          to heaven, it would he reasonable enough for you to despair of doing
          it. Of your own impotence it is impossible you can be too deeply
          convinced. You cannot do anything whatever, but Christ gives you his
          promise to preserve you even to the end. If you believe on him you
          shall be saved. He does not say you shall he saved for a year, or for
          twenty years, and then, perhaps, he lost at last. No; but |he that
          believeth and is baptized, shall he saved.| If one man who believes in
          Christ is cast away, that promise of Christ is not true. Brethren, it
          is true, and it must he true, and let its glorious truth be sweetly
          familiar with you now -- if you give your soul to Christ, putting
          simple faith in his person as the Son of God, and in his work as the
          Mediator between God and man, you shall as surely see his face within
          the pearly gates of heaven as your eyes see me to-night. There may he
          a question about your seeing me, but there can be no question about
          Christ fulfilling his promise and keeping his word. Now sit down in
          the dust no longer, thou doubting, mourning, trembling sinner. With a
          loud voice I say unto thee, as Paul did, |Stand upright on thy feet.|
          Wherefore dost thou mourn? There is nothing to mourn about. Thy sin is
          forgiven; thine eternal salvation is secure; a crown in heaven is
          provided for thee, and a harp of gold awaits thee. If thou believest
          in Jesus none can lay anything to thy charge. Not even the
          principalities of darkness shall be able to prevail against thee.
          Eternal love secures thee against the malice of hell. Stand upright,
          then, on thy feet, for if thou believest thou art saved, completely
          saved, saved in time, and for eternal days, saved in the Lord with an
          everlasting salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then possibly there is one here who cannot stand upright because of
          his many sins. Ah! while I have been talking about Christ it may be
          something has been saying in your heart, |Ah! ah! what is it? Christ
          taking men's sins, suffering in their stead? That suits me. Is God
          doing this? Ah! then he must be able to save, and I am told that
          whosoever trusteth in him shall never perish; is it so? Why, here I
          am; I who have not been in a place of worship for months, for years, I
          have strayed in here to-night, and if what this man says be true, well
          then I will even venture my soul upon it; I have got nothing, I know,
          but he says there is nothing wanted; I am not prepared to trust
          Christ, but he says there is no preparation required, and if I trust
          Jesus Christ just as I am, Christ will save me; why, I will do it; by
          the grace of God I will do it; can he save me?| Then comes in the
          bitter reflection -- |Look what a sinner I have been! why, I should be
          ashamed to say how foully I have sinned; he must shut me out; I have
          been too great a villain, too gross an offender; I have cursed and
          sworn at such a rate; he cannot mean that if I trust Christ I shall be
          saved; 1 believe he can save me; I see the fitness of the plan, and
          the excellency of it; I believe it, but see what a sinner I am!|
          Sinner, stand upright on thy feet, for |all manner of sin and
          blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.| Return, thou wanderer, return
          to thy Father's house! He comes to meet thee. On thy neck he will
          fall, and thou shalt be his child for ever. Only believe thou in his
          Son Jesus Christ, and though this he the first time thou hast ever
          heard his Word, I would settle mine eyes upon thee earnestly, and say,
          |Stand upright on thy feet.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! how often I do wish that somebody had come to me when I was under
          depression of mind, and had told me about the simple gospel of Jesus
          Christ. I think I should have stood upright on my feet long before I
          did, but, alas! I kept hearing about what people felt before they
          believed in Christ -- very proper preaching -- and I was afraid I did
          not feel it, though now I know I did. I heard a great deal about what
          Christians ought to be, and a great deal more about God's elect, what
          they are in his esteem, but I did not know whether I was one of God's
          elect, and I knew I was not what I ought to be. O for the trumpet of
          the archangel, to sound the words, |Believe and live,| as loud as the
          voice which shall wake the dead in their graves! and O for the
          quickening Spirit to go with voice, as it shall go with the ringing of
          the archangel's trump, when the graves shall open, and the dead shall
          arise! Go, you who know it, and tell it everywhere, for there are
          multitudes, I doubt not, who are really seeking Christ, and who have
          his Spirit in them, but it is like as the prophet hath it, |The
          children have come to the birth and there is no strength to bring
          forth.| They have come to the very edge of light, and they only want
          one helping hand to bring them into noonday. They are slipping about
          in the Slough of Despond, and they are almost out of it, but they want
          just a helping hand to pull them out. This hand of help is stretched
          out by thus telling them, telling them plainly, it is in Jesus their
          help is found, and that trusting him, relying upon him, they shall
          never perish. neither shall any pluck them out of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would to God that some of you, who have been long hearing me, might
          be found in this class. I have been bowed down in spirit at some sad
          things which have been brought to my hearing of late. I know that
          there are some here, and there always have been some few attending my
          ministry, who have a personal affection for me, and who listen to the
          Word with very great attention, and who, moreover, are very greatly
          moved by it, but who have some besetting sin which they either cannot
          or will not give up. They do renounce it for a time, but either bad
          associates, or else the strength of their passions, take them away
          again. O sirs! I would ye would take warning. There was one of whom we
          had some sort of hope, who listened to our ministry. There came a
          turning point with him; it was this, either that he must give up sin,
          or else give up coming to the Tabernacle; and what -- oh! what became
          of him? I could indicate the place where he sat. He died of delirium
          tremens! And I do not wonder. When you have heard the gospel preached
          Sabbath after Sabbath, when your response to the solemn appeals you
          have earnestly listened to has only been that you reject Christ and
          refuse eternal life -- is it any marvel that in making the choice of
          your own damnation reason should resign its seat as director of your
          actions, and cease to curb your headstrong will, leaving the maddened
          passions to dash on with reckless fury, and precipitate your
          destruction. Am I clear of their blood? I have asked myself the
          question. I may not be in some things, but I know I am as far as my
          ministry is concerned. I have not shunned to declare unto any of you
          the whole counsel of God. When I have known any vice, or any folly --
          which of you have I been afraid of, or before whom of you all have I
          trembled? God is my witness; him have I served in the spirit; and if
          these turn aside unto their crooked ways, they have not done it
          without well knowing the consequences; nay, they have not done it
          without being warned and entreated, and persuaded to look unto Jesus
          Christ. And I do conjure some of you -- you know to whom I refer -- I
          do conjure those of you who have a conscience which is not seared, but
          who, nevertheless, persevere in your sins -- I conjure you by the love
          of God, do me this one favor at the last: if you choose your own ruin,
          bear witness for me that I have not hesitated to warn you of it. I had
          infinitely rather, however, that you would do yourselves this great
          favor, to love your own souls. If you have anything to throw into the
          fire, throw it in, but let it not be your soul. If you have anything
          to lose, go and lose it, but do not lose your soul. Sirs, if you must
          play the fool, indulge your sport at a cheaper rate than this. If sin
          be worth having, then I pray you pay a cheaper price than your own
          souls for it, for it does seem to me so pitiful, so sorrowful a thing,
          that you who have been so short a time among us and are passing away
          before my very eyes, should still prefer the fleeting joy of the
          moment to the eternal joy, and risk everlasting torment for temporary
          mirth. By the tears of Jesus when he wept over Jerusalem, by the blood
          of Jesus which he shed for guilty men, by the heart of the eternal
          Father who willeth not the death of a sinner but had rather that he
          should turn unto him and live, I pray you he wise and consider your
          ways. Choose ye this day whom ye will serve, and may the Lord guide
          your choice. May you fall into the arms of divine mercy and say, |If
          thou wilt help me, Jesus, here I am; I give myself to thee.| May my
          Master teach me how to address you if I do not know how to gasp the
          words of simplicity, tenderness, of terrible apprehension, but of
          persuasive power. If there were any words in any language that would
          melt you, this tongue is at your service to utter them. If there is
          any form of speech, though it should make me to be called vulgar, and
          subject me to the shame and hissing which once I endured, if the
          furnace could be heated seven times hotter than that, I would but
          laugh at it if I might but win your souls. Tell me, sirs, how shall I
          put the case? Would you have argument? I wish that I could reason with
          you. Would you have tears? There, let them flow! Ye dry eyes, why do
          ye not weep more for these perishing souls? Would you have God's Word
          without my word? Sirs, I would read it, and let my tongue he dumb if
          that would teach you. Would my death save you? That God who seeth in
          secret knoweth that to-night it were a joy to me to enter into my
          rest, and so it were little for me to talk of being willing to give a
          life for you, and it were, indeed, but a trifle to me. Oh! why will ye
          perish? Why should I plead with you, and you not care for yourselves?
          What is it that besets you? Poor moths! Are ye dazzled with the
          flames? Are ye not content to have singed your wings? Must they also
          consume body and soul? How can ye make your bed in hell? How can ye
          abide with eternal burnings? In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, I
          command you -- for I can do no less -- I command you to turn unto him
          and live. Believe on him and you shall he saved. But remember, at your
          hazard you reject the message to-night. It may he the last message
          that shall ever come to your soul with power, if ye cast this away --
        </p>
        <p>|What chains of vengeance must they feel,</p>
        <p>Who slight the bonds of love?|</p>
        <p>
          I would have you saved just now. I cannot talk about to-morrow. I
          would have you decide it at once. Oh! you have come as far as this
          twenty times, and have you gone back again? You have been aroused, you
          have made vows and you have broken them, resolutions and you have
          belied them. O sirs, for God's sake do not lie to the Almighty again.
          Now be true this time. May the Spirit of God make you speak the truth,
          even though you should he compelled to say, through your wickedness,
          |I will not submit myself unto the Son of God.| Do speak the truth.
          Procrastinate not. As Elijah said, |How long halt ye between two
          opinions?| so say I. If God he God serve him, but if Baal he God serve
          him. But do not keep on coming here and then going to the pot-house.
          Do not come and take your seat here and then go to the brothel. Sirs,
          do not this foul scandal for God's sake, and for your own sake. If you
          will serve the devil serve him, and he a true servant to him. If you
          mean to go to hell, go there; but if you seek eternal life and joys to
          come, give up these things. Renounce them. Why drink poison and drink
          medicine too? Have done with one or the other and be honest. Be honest
          to your own souls. May the Lord grant that tonight some may have given
          to them, not only |faith to be saved,| but the faith which saves, for
          his name's sake. Amen.<br />
