          |And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.| -- John 12:32.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT was an extraordinary occasion upon which the Saviour uttered these
          words. It was the crisis of the world. We very often speak of the
          |present crisis of affairs,| and it is very common for persons of
          every period to believe their own age to be the crisis and turning
          point of the whole world's history. They rightly imagine that very
          much of the future depends upon their present exertions; but they
          wrongly stretch the thought, and imagine that the period of their
          existence is the very hinge of the history of the world: that it is
          the crisis. Now, however it may be correct, in a modified sense, that
          every period of time is in some sense a crisis, yet there never was a
          time which could be truly called a crisis, in comparison with the
          season when our Saviour spoke. In the 31st verse, immediately
          preceding my text, we find in the English translation, |Now is the
          judgment of this world;| but we find in the Greek, |Now is the crisis
          of this world.| The world had come to a solemn crisis: now was the
          great turning point of all the world's history. Should Christ die, or
          should he not? If he would refuse the bitter cup of agony, the world
          is doomed, if he should pass onward, do battle with the powers of
          death and hell! and come off a victor, then the world is blessed, and
          her future shall be glorious. Shall he succumb? Then is the world
          crushed and ruined beneath the trail of the old serpent. Shall he
          conquer? Shall he lead captivity captive and receive gifts for men?
          Then this world shall yet see times when there shall be |a new heaven
          and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.| |Now is the crisis
          of this world!| |The crisis,| he says, |is two-fold. Dealing with
          Satan and men. I will tell you the result of it. Now shall the prince
          of this world be cast out.' Fear not that hell shall conquer. I shall
          cast him out; and, on the other hand doubt not but that I shall be
          victorious over the hearts of men. I, if I be lifted up, will draw all
          men unto me.'| Remembering the occasion upon which these words were
          uttered, we shall now proceed to a discussion of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have three things to notice. Christ crucified, Christ's glory. He
          calls it a lifting him up. Christ crucified, the minister's theme. It
          is the minister's business to lift Christ up in the gospel. Christ
          crucified, the heart's attraction. |I, if I be lifted up, will draw
          all men unto me.| His own glory -- the minister's theme -- the heart's
          attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I begin then: CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION IS CHRIST'S GLORY. He uses the
          word |lifted up| to express the manner of his death. |I, if I be
          lifted up, will draw all men unto me. This he said, signifying what
          death he should die.| But notice the choice of the word to express his
          death. He does not say, I, if I be crucified, I, if I be hanged on the
          tree; no, but |I if I be lifted up:| and in the Greek there is the
          meaning of exaltation. |I, if I be exalted -- I if I be lifted on
          high.| He took the outward and risible fashion of the cross, it being
          a lifting of him up, to be the type and symbol of the glory with which
          the cross should invest even him. |I, if I be lifted up.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the cross of Christ is Christ's glory. We will show you how. Man
          seeks to win his glory by the slaughter of others -- Christ by the
          slaughter of himself: men seek to get crowns of gold -- he sought a
          crown of thorns: men think that glory lieth in being exalted over
          others -- Christ thought that his glory did lie in becoming |a worm
          and no man,| a scoff and reproach amongst all that beheld him. He
          stooped when he conquered; and he counted that the glory lay as much
          in the stooping as in the conquest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ was glorified on the cross, we say, first, because love as
          always glorious. If I might prefer any glory, I should ask to be
          beloved by men. Surely, the greatest glory that a man can have among
          his fellows is not that of mere admiration, when they stare at him as
          he passes through the street, and throng the avenues to behold him as
          he rideth in his triumph; the greatest fame, the greatest glory of a
          patriot is the love of his country -- to feel that young men and
          maidens, old men and sires, are prepared to fall at his feet in love,
          to give up all they have to serve him who has served them. Now, Christ
          won more love by the cross than he did ever win elsewhere. O Lord
          Jesus, thou wouldst never have been so much loved, if thou hadst sat
          in heaven for ever, as thou art now loved since thou hast stooped to
          death. Not cherubim and seraphim, and angels clad in light, ever could
          have loved with hearts so warm as thy redeemed above, or even thy
          redeemed below. Thou didst win love more abundantly by the nail than
          by thy scepter. Thine open side brought thee no emptiness of love, for
          thy people love thee with all their hearts. Christ won glory by his
          cross. He was never so lifted up as when he was cast down; and the
          Christian will bear witness, that though he loves his Master anywhere,
          yet nothing moves his heart to rapture and vehemence of love, like the
          story of the crucifixion and the agonies of Calvary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: Christ at this time won much glory by fortitude. The cross was
          a trial of Christ's fortitude and strength, and therein it was a
          garden in which his glory might be planted. The laurels of his crown
          were sown in a soil that was saturated with his own blood. Sometimes
          the ambitious soldier pants for battle, because in days of peace he
          cannot distinguish himself. |Here I sit,| saith he, |and rust my sword
          in my scabbard, and win no glory; let me rush to the cannon's mouth;
          though some call honor a Fainted bauble, it may be so, yet I am a
          soldier, and I want it |and he pants for the encounter that he may win
          glory. Now, in an infinitely higher sense than that poor glory which
          the soldier gets, Christ looked upon the cross as being his way to
          honor. |Oh!| said he, |now shall be the time of my endurance: I have
          suffered much, but I shall suffer more, and then shall the world see
          what a strong heart of love I have; how patient is the Lamb, how
          mighty to endure. Never would Christ have had such paeans of praise
          and such songs of honor as he now winneth, if he had avoided the
          conflict, and the battle, and the agony. We might have blessed him for
          what he is and for what he wished to do; we might have loved him for
          the very longings of his heart but we never could have praised him for
          his strong endurance, for his intrepid spirit, for his unconquerable
          love, if we had not seen him put to the severe test of crucifixion and
          the agonies of that awful day. Christ did win glory by his being
          crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: Christ looked upon his crucifixion as the completion of all his
          work, and therefore he looked upon it as an exaltation. The completion
          of an enterprise is the harvest of its honor. Though thousands have
          perished in the arctic regions, and have obtained fame for their
          intrepid conduct, yet, my friends, the man who at last discovers the
          passage is the most of all honored; and though we shall for ever
          remember those bold men who pushed their way through winter in all its
          might, and dared the perils of the deep, yet the man who accomplishes
          the deed wins more than his share of the glory. Surely the
          accomplishment of an enterprise is just the point where the honor
          hangs. And, my hearers, Christ longed for the cross, because he looked
          for it as the goal of all his exertions. It was to be the place upon
          which he could say, |It is finished.| He could never say |It is
          finished| on his throne: but on his cross he did cry it. He preferred
          the sufferings of Calvary to the honors of the multitude who crowded
          round about him; for, preach as he might, and bless them as he might,
          and heal them as he might, still was his work undone. He was
          straitened; he had a baptism to be baptized with, and how was he
          straitened till it was accomplished. |But,| he said, |now I pant for
          my cross, for it is the topstone of my labor. I long for my
          sufferings, because they shall be the completion of my great work of
          grace.| Brethren, it is the end that bringeth the honor; it is the
          victory that crowneth the warrior rather than the battle. And so
          Christ longed for this, his death, that he might see the completion of
          his labor. |Ay,| said he, |when I am crucified, I am exalted, and
          lifted up.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, once again, Christ looked upon his crucifixion with the eye of
          firm faith as the hour of triumph. His disciples thought that the
          cross would be a degradation; Christ looked through the outward and
          visible, and beheld the spiritual. |The cross,| said he, |the gibbet
          of my doom may seem to be cursed with ignominy, and the world shall
          stand round and hiss at the crucified; my name be for ever dishonored
          as one who died upon the tree; and cavillers and scoffers may for ever
          throw this in the teeth of my friends that I died with the malefactor;
          but I look not at the cross as you do. I know its ignominy, but I
          despise the shame -- I am prepared to endure it all. I look upon the
          cross as the gate of triumph, as the portal of victory. Oh, shall I
          tell you what I shall behold upon the cross? -- just when mine eye is
          swimming with the last tear, and when my heart is palpitating with its
          last pang; just when my body is rent with its last thrill of anguish,
          then mine eye shall see the head of the dragon broken, it shall see
          hell's towers dismantled and its castle fallen. Mine eye shall see my
          seed eternally saved, I shall behold the ransomed coming from their
          prison-houses. In that last moment of my doom, when my mouth is just
          preparing for its last cry of It is finished;' I shall behold the year
          of my redeemed come, I shall shout my triumph in the delivery of all
          my beloved! Ay, and I shall see then, the world, mine own earth
          conquered, and usurpers all disthroned, and I shall behold in vision
          the glories of the latter days, when I shall sit upon the throne of my
          father David and judge the earth, attended with the pomp of angels and
          the shouts of my beloved!| Yes, Christ saw in his cross the victories
          of it, and therefore did he pant and long for it as being the place of
          victory and the means of conquest. |I,| said Jesus, |if I be lifted
          up, if I be exalted,| he puts his crucifixion as being his glory. This
          is the first point of our text.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, now, secondly, CHRIST HAS ANOTHER LIFTING UP, not
          ignominious, but truly honorable; there is a lifting of him upon the
          pole of the gospel, in the preaching of the Word. Christ Jesus is to
          be lifted up every day; for that purpose he came into the world: |That
          like as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,| even so he
          might by the preaching of the truth be lifted up, |that whosoever
          believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.| Christ
          is THE MINISTER'S GREAT THEME, in opposition to a thousand other
          things which most men choose. I would prefer that the most prominent
          feature in my ministry should be the preaching of Christ Jesus. Christ
          should be most prominent, not hell and damnation. God's ministers must
          preach God's terrors as well as God's mercies; we are to preach the
          thunder of God's law. If men will sin, we are to tell them that they
          must be punished for it. If they will transgress, woe unto the
          watchman who is ashamed to say, |The Lord cometh that taketh
          vengeance.| We should be unfaithful to the solemn charge which God has
          given us if we were wickedly to stifle all the threatenings of God's
          word. Does God say, |The wicked shall be cast into hell, with all the
          nations that forget God?| It is our business to say so. Did the loving
          Saviour talk of the pit that burneth, of the worm that never dieth,
          and of the fire that can never be extinguished? It is ours to speak as
          he spake, and not to mince the matter. It is no mercy to men to hide
          their doom. But, my brethren, terrors never ought to be the prominent
          feature of a minister's preaching. Many old divines thought they would
          do a great deal of good by preaching this. I do not believe it. Some
          souls are awakened and terrified by such preaching; they however, are
          but few. Sometimes, right solemnly, the sacred mysteries of eternal
          wrath must be preached, but far oftener let us preach the wondrous
          love of God. There are more souls won by wooing than by threatening.
          It is not hell, but Christ, we desire to preach. O sinners, we are not
          afraid to tell you of your doom, but we do not choose to be for ever
          dwelling on that doleful theme. We rather love to tell you of Christ,
          and him crucified. We want to have our preaching rather full of the
          frankincense of the merits of Christ than of the smoke, and fire, and
          terrors of Mount Sinai, we are not come unto Mount Sinai, but unto
          Mount Zion -- where milder words declare the will of God, and rivers
          of salvation are abundantly flowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the theme of a minister should be Christ Jesus in opposition to
          mere doctrine. Some of my good brethren are always preaching doctrine.
          Well, they are right in so doing, but I would not care myself to have
          as the characteristic of my preaching, doctrine only. I would rather
          have it said, |He dwelt much upon the person of Christ, and seemed
          best pleased when he began to tell about the atonement and the
          sacrifice. He was not ashamed of the doctrines, he was not afraid of
          threatening, but he seemed as if he preached the threatening with
          tears in his eyes, and the doctrine solemnly as God's own word; but
          when he preached of Jesus his tongue was loosed, and his heart was at
          liberty.| Brethren, there are some men who preach the doctrine only,
          who are an injury, I believe to God's church rather than a benefit. I
          know of men who have set themselves up as umpires over all spirits.
          They are the men. Wisdom will die with them. If they were once taken
          away the great standard of truth would be removed. We do not wonder
          that they hate the Pope, two of a trade never agree, for they are far
          more popish than he, they being themselves infallible. I am afraid
          that very much of the soundness of this age, is but a mere sound, and
          is not real; does not enter into the eye of the heart, nor affect the
          being. Brethren, we would rather preach Christ than election. We love
          election, we love predestination, we love the great doctrines of God's
          word, but we had rather preach Christ than preach these. We desire to
          put Christ over the head of the doctrine, we make the doctrine the
          throne for Christ to sit on, but we dare not put Christ at the bottom,
          and then press him down, and overload him with the doctrines of his
          own word.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, the minister ought to preach Christ in opposition to mere
          morality. How many ministers in London could preach as well out of
          Shakespeare as the Bible, for all they want is a moral maxim. The good
          man never thinks of mentioning regeneration. He sometimes talks of
          moral renovation. He does not think of talking about perseverance by
          grace. No, continuance in well-doing is his perpetual cry. He does not
          think of preaching |believe and be saved.| No; his continual
          exhortation is, |Good Christian people, say your prayers, and behave
          weld, and by these means you shall enter the kingdom of heaven.| The
          sum and substance of his gospel is that we can do very well without
          Christ, that although certainly there is a little amiss in us, yet if
          we just mend our ways in some little degree, that old text, |except a
          man be born again,| need not trouble us. If you want to be made
          drunkards, if you want to be made dishonest, if you want to be taught
          every vice in the world, go and hear a moral preacher. These
          gentlemen, in their attempts to reform and make people moral, are the
          men that lead them from morality. Hear the testimony of holy Bishop
          Lavington, |We have long been attempting to reform the nation by moral
          preaching. With what effect! None. On the contrary, we have
          dexterously preached the people into downright infidelity. We must
          change our voice; we must preach Christ and him crucified; nothing but
          the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet one more remark. The minister ought to preach Christ in
          opposition to some who think they ought to preach learning. God forbid
          we should ever preach against learning. The more of it a man can get,
          the better for him; and the better for his hearers if he has grace
          enough to use it well, but there are some who have so much of
          learning, that if in the course of their readings they find a very
          hard word, out comes the pencil-case: they jot it down, to be
          glorified in the next Sunday morning's sermon. Do they find out some
          outlandish German expression, which, if pulled to pieces, would mean
          nothing, but which looks as if it must be something wonderful, that
          must always come out, if all the gospel go to the wall. You ought to
          pray to God that they may never be allowed to read anything but their
          Bibles all the week because then you might hear something you could
          understand: but this would not suit his reference, if he could be
          understood, he would not be a great preacher, for a great preacher,
          according to the opinion of some, is a man who is called intellectual
          -- that is to say, a man who knows more about the Bible than the Bible
          knows about itself, a man who can explain all mysteries by intellect
          merely, who smiles at anything like unction and savor, or the
          influence of God's Spirit as being mere fanaticism. Intellect with him
          is everything. You sit and hear him, you go out, |Dear me, what a
          remarkable man he is. I suppose he made something out of the text, but
          I did not know what it was. He seemed to me to be in a fog himself
          although I admit it was an extremely luminous haze.| Then people will
          go again, and be sure to take a pew in that church, because they say
          he is such a clever man. The only reason is because they cannot
          understand him. In reading the other day a book of advice to
          ministers, I found it stated, and very gravely too, by some good old
          tutor of a college, |Always have one part of your sermon which the
          vulgar cannot comprehend, because in that way you will have a name for
          learning, and what you say that they can understand, will impress them
          the more, for by putting in a sentence or two which is
          incomprehensible, you at once strike their minds as being a superior
          man, and they believe in the weight and the authority of your
          learning, and therefore, give credence to the rest which they can
          comprehend.| Now, I hold that is all wrong. Christ wants us not to
          preach learning, but to preach the good word of life in the simplest
          manner possible. Why, if I could only get lords and ladies to listen
          to me, by preaching to them so that they alone could understand me,
          there! they might go, and I would not so much as snap my finger for
          them all. I would desire so to preach that the servant maid can
          understand, that the coachman can understand, that the poor and
          illiterate may hear readily and gladly receive the word. And mark you,
          there never will be much good come to the ministry until it is
          simplified, until our brethren learn one language, which they do not
          seem to know. Latin, Greek, French, Hebrew, and twenty other languages
          they know. There is one I would recommend to their very serious study
          -- it is called Anglo-Saxon. If they would just try and learn that, it
          is astonishing what a mighty language they would find it to move the
          hearts of men. Saxon before every language in the world. When every
          other has died out for want of power, Saxon will live, and triumph
          with its iron tongue, and its voice of steel. We must have the common,
          plain language in which to address the people. And mark this, we must
          have Christ lifted up, Christ crucified, without the gauds and
          fripperies of learning, without the trappings of attempted eloquence
          or oratory. If Christ Jesus be earnestly preached he will draw all men
          unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. AND NOW WE GO TO THE THIRD POINT, WHICH IS, INDEED, THE ESSENCE
          OF THE TEXT, THE ATTRACTIVE POWER OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST. If Christ be
          thus preached, thus fully held forth, thus simply proclaimed to the
          people, the effect will be, he will draw all men unto him. Now, I will
          show the attracting power of Christ in three or four ways. Christ
          draws like a trumpet attracting men to hear the proclamation. Christ
          draws like a net bringing men out of the sea of sin. Christ draws,
          also, with bonds of love. In the next place, Christ attracts like a
          standard, bringing all the soldiers round him, and, in the last place,
          Christ draws like a chariot. |I, if I be lifted up, I will draw all
          men unto me.| Now I will try if I can show these points.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I said that Christ draws as a trumpet. Men have been wont to
          sound a trumpet to attract an audience to the reading of a
          proclamation. The people come from their houses at the well-known
          sound, to listen to what they are desired to know. Now, my brethren,
          part of the attractive power of the gospel lies in the attracting
          people to hear it. You cannot expect people to be blessed by the
          preaching of the gospel if they do not hear it. One part of the battle
          is to get them to listen to its sound. Now, the question is asked in
          these times, |How are we to get the working-classes to listen to the
          word?| The answer is, Christ is his own attraction, Christ is the only
          trumpet that you want to trumpet Christ. Preach the gospel, and the
          congregation will come of themselves. The only infallible way of
          getting a good congregation, is to do this. |Oh!| said a Socinian
          once, to a good Christian minister, |I cannot make it out; my chapel
          is always empty, and yours always crammed full. And yet I am sure mine
          is the more rational doctrine, and you are not by any means so
          talented a preacher as I am | -- |Well,| said the other |I will tell
          you the reason why your chapel is empty, and mine full. The people
          have a conscience, and that conscience tells them that what I preach
          is true and that what you preach is false, so they will not hear you.|
          You shall look through the history of this realm ever since the
          commencement of the days of Protestantism, and I will dare to say it
          without fear of contradiction, that you will almost in every case find
          that the men who have attracted the greatest mass of people to hear
          them, have been men who were the most evangelical -- who preached the
          most about Christ and him crucified. What was there in Whitfield to
          attract an audience, except the simple gospel preached with a vehement
          oratory that carried everything before it. Oh, It was not his oratory,
          but the gospel that drew the people. There is a something about the
          truth that always makes it popular. For tell me that if a man preaches
          the truth his chapel wild be empty. Sir, I defy you to prove that.
          Christ preached his own truth, and the common people heard him gladly,
          and the multitude flocked to listen to him. My good ministering
          brother, have you got an empty church? Do you want to fill it? I will
          give you a good receipt, and if you will follow it, you will, in all
          probability, have your chapel full to the doors. Burn all your
          manuscripts, that is No.1. Give up your notes, that is No.2. Read your
          Bible and preach it as you find it in the simplicity of its language.
          And give up all your Latinized English. Begin to tell the people what
          you have felt in your own heart, and beseech the Holy Spirit to make
          your heart as hot as a furnace for zeal. Then go out and talk to the
          people. Speak to them like their brother. Be a man amongst men. Tell
          them what you have felt and what you know, and tell it heartily with a
          good, bold face; and, my dear friend, I do not care who you are, you
          will get a congregation. But if you say, |Now, to get a congregation,
          I must buy an organ.| That will not serve you a bit. |But we must have
          a good choir.| I would not care to have a congregation that comes
          through a good choir. |No,| says another, |but really I must a little
          alter my style of preaching.| My dear friend, it is not the style of
          preaching, it is the style of feeling. People sometimes begin to mimic
          other preachers, because they are successful. Why, the worst preachers
          are those who mimic others, whom they look upon as standards preach
          naturally. Preach out of your hearts just what you feel to be true,
          and the old soul-stirring words of the gospel will soon draw a
          congregation. |Where the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered
          together.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But if it ended there, what would be the good of it? If the
          congregation came and listened to the sound, and then went away
          unsaved, of what use would it be? But in the next place, Christ acts
          as a net to draw men unto him. The gospel ministry is, in God's Word,
          compared to a fishery; God's ministers are the fishermen, they go to
          catch souls, as fishermen go to catch fish. How shall souls be caught?
          They shall be caught by preaching Christ. Just preach a sermon that is
          full of Christ, and throw it unto your congregation, as you throw a
          net into the sea -- you need not look where they are, nor try to fit
          your sermon to different cases; but, throw it in, and as sure as God's
          Word is what it is, it shall not return to him void; it shall
          accomplish that which he pleases, and prosper in the thing whereto he
          hath sent it. The gospel never was unsuccessful yet, when it was
          preached with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. It is not
          fine orations upon the death of princes, or the movements of politics
          which will save souls. If we wish to have sinners saved and to have
          our churches increased; if we desire the spread of God's kingdom, the
          only thing whereby we can hope to accomplish the end, is the lifting
          up of Christ; for, |I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, Christ Jesus draws as the cords of love. After men
          are saved, they are still apt to go astray; it needs a cord to reach
          all the way from a sinner to heaven; and it needs to have a hand
          pulling at him all the way. Now, Christ Jesus is the bead of love that
          draw, the saint to heaven. O child of God, thou wouldst go astray
          again if Jesus did not hold thee fast; it he did not draw thee to
          himself thou wouldst still, still wander. Christian people are like
          our earth. Our world has two forces, it has one tendency to run off at
          a tangent from its orbit; but the sun draws it by a centripetal power
          and attracts it to itself, and so between the two forces it is kept in
          a perpetual circle. Oh! Christian, thou wilt never walk aright, and
          keep in the orbit of truth, if it be not for the influence of Christ
          perpetually attracting thee to the center. Thou feelest, and if thou
          dost not feel always, It is still there, -- thou feelest an attraction
          between thine heart and Christ, and Christ is perpetually drawing thee
          to himself, to his likeness, to his character, to his love, to his
          bosom, and in that way thou art kept from thy natural tendency to fly
          off and to be lost in the wide fields of sin. Bless God, that Christ
          lifted up draws all his people unto him in that fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in the next place Christ Jesus is the center of attraction;
          even as a standard is the center of gathering. We want unity in these
          days; we are now crying out, |away with sectarianism.| O for unity!
          there are some of us who truly pant after it. We do not talk about an
          evangelical alliance; alliances are made between men of different
          countries. We believe that the phrase |Evangelical Alliance| is a
          faulty one, -- it should be |Evangelical Union,| -- knit together in
          Union. Why! I am not in alliance with a brother of the Church of
          England; I would not be in alliance with him if he were ever so good a
          man! I would be in union with him, I would love him with all my heart,
          but I would not make a mere alliance with him. He never was mine
          enemy, he never shall be; and, therefore, it is not an alliance I want
          with him, -- it is a union. And so with all God's people, they do not
          care about alliances; they love real union and communion one with
          another. Now, what is the right way to bring all the churches to
          union? |We must revise the prayer book,| says one. You may revise it,
          and revise it as long as ever you like, you will never bring some of
          us to agree to it, for we hate Prayer Books as such, however near
          perfection. |Well then, we must revise the doctrines, so that they may
          meet all classes.| You cannot; that is impossible. |Well then, we must
          revise the discipline.| Yes, sweep the Augean stable. And then after
          that, the mass of us will stand as much aloof as ever. |No, but we
          must each of us make mutual concession.| Indeed, I wonder who will,
          except the Vicars of Bray, who have no principle at all. For if we
          have to make mutual concession, who can be guarantee that I must not
          concede a part of what I believe to be true? And that I cannot do, nor
          can my brother on the opposite side. The only standard of union that
          can ever be lifted up in England, is the cross of Christ. As soon as
          we shall begin to preach Christ and him crucified, we shall be all
          one. We can fight anywhere except at the foot of the cross, -- there
          it is that the order goes forth, |sheath swords;| and those that were
          bitter combatants before, come and prostrate themselves there, and
          say, |Thou dear Redeemer, thou hast melted us into one.| Oh! my
          brethren, let us all preach the gospel mightily, and there will be
          union. The church of England is becoming more united with dissenters.
          Our good friends at Exeter Hall have gone a very long way to bless the
          world, and uproot the exclusiveness of their own system. As sure as
          ever they are alive they have taken the most excellent step in the
          world to pull down the absurd pretensions of some of their own
          brethren, to the exclusive claim of being |the Church.| I glory and
          rejoice in it! I bless God for that movement, and I pray that the day
          may come when every bishop may do the same. And I do not glory in it
          merely because I look upon it as the beginning of union, but because
          of the preaching of the gospel. But, at the same time, I know this,
          let their example be followed, and the barriers between dissenters and
          the church of England are not tenable. Even the nationality of
          Episcopacy must yet come down. If my lord, the bishop of so and so, is
          to have so many thousands a year for preaching to a number of people
          in Exeter Hall, I have as much right as he has to a State grant, for I
          serve as many Englishmen as he does. There is no one church in the
          world that has any right to take a farthing of national money any more
          than I have. And if there are ten thousand gathered here, it is an
          unrighteous thing that we should have no subsidy from the State, when
          a paltry congregation of thirteen and a half in the City of London is
          to be supported out of national money. The thing cannot be held long,
          it is impossible; Christ's Church will one day reject the patronage of
          the State. Let all of us begin to preach the gospel, and we shall soon
          see that the gospel is self-supporting; and that the gospel does not
          want entrenchments of bigotry and narrow-mindedness, in order to make
          it stand. No, we shall say, |brother, there is my pulpit for you. You
          are an Episcopalian, preach in my pulpit, you are right welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Episcopalian will say, |You are a Baptist, and my brother, there
          is the parish church for you.| And I just announce that the first
          chance I get to preach in a parish church, I will do it, and risk the
          consequence. They are our structures, they belong to all England, we
          can give them to whom we please, and if to-morrow the will of the
          sovereign people should transfer those edifices to another
          denomination, there is nothing in the world that can prevent it. But
          if not, by what law of Christian love is one denomination to shut its
          pulpit doors against every other? Many of my dear friends in the
          Episcopal Church are willing to lend their edifices, but they dare
          not. But mark you? when the gospel is preached fully, all those things
          will be broken down. For one brother will say, |My dear friend, you
          preach Christ and so do I, I cannot shut you out of my pulpit.| And
          another will cry, |I am anxious for the salvation of souls, and so are
          you, come into my house, come into my heart, I love you.| The only
          means of unity we shall ever get will be all of us preaching Christ
          crucified; when that is done, when every minister's heart is in the
          right place, full of anxiety for souls -- when every minister feels
          that, be he called bishop, presbyter, or preacher -- all he wants to
          do is to glorify God and win souls to Jesus, then, my dear friends, we
          can maintain our denominational distinctions, but the great bugbear of
          bigotry and division will have ceased and schism will no more be
          known. For that day I anxiously pray, may God send it in his own time.
          As far as I am concerned there is my hand for every minister of God in
          creation, and my heart with it, I love all them that love the Lord
          Jesus Christ. And I feel persuaded that the nearer we all of us come
          to the one point of putting Christ first, Christ last, Christ midst,
          and Christ without end -- the nearer we shall come to the unity of the
          one Church of Christ in the bond of holy permanence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I close by noticing the last sweet thought -- |I, if I be
          lifted up, will draw all men unto me.| Then Christ Jesus will draw all
          his people to heaven; he says he will draw them unto himself. He is in
          heaven; then Christ is the chariot in which souls are drawn to heaven.
          The people of the Lord are on their way to heaven, they are carried in
          everlasting arms; and those arms are the arms of Christ. Christ is
          carrying them up to his own house, to his own throne; by-and-by his
          prayer -- |Father, I will that they, whom thou hast given me be with
          me where I am,| shall be wholly fulfilled. And it is fulfilling now,
          for he is like a strong courser drawing his children in the chariot of
          the covenant of grace unto himself. Oh! blessed be God, the cross is
          the plank on which we swim to heaven; the cross is the great covenant
          transport which will weather out the storms, and reach its desired
          heaven. This is the chariot, the pillars where with are of gold, and
          the bottom thereof silver, it is lined with the purple of the
          atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, poor sinner, I would to God Christ would pardon thee;
          remember his death on Calvary, remember his agonies and bloody sweat
          -- all this he did for thee; if thou feelest thyself to be a sinner.
          Does not this draw thee to him?
        </p>
        <p>|Though thou art guilty he is good,</p>
        <p>He'll wash thy soul in Jesus' blood.|</p>
        <p>
          Thou hast rebelled against him, and revolted, but he says, |return
          backsliding children.| Will not his love draw thee? I pray that both
          may have their power and influence, that thou mayest be drawn to
          Christ now, and at last be drawn to heaven. May God give a blessing
          for Jesus' sake. Amen.<br />
