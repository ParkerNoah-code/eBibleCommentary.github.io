        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.213)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 12, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>|Our Father which art in heaven.| -- Matthew 6:9.</p>
        <p>
          I THINK there is room for very great doubt, whether our Saviour
          intended the prayer, of which our text forms a part, to be used in the
          manner in which it is commonly employed among professing Christians.
          It is the custom of many persons to repeat it as their morning prayer,
          and they think that when they have repeated these sacred words they
          have done enough. I believe that this prayer was never intended for
          universal use. Jesus Christ taught it not to all men, but to his
          disciples, and it is a prayer adapted only to those who are the
          possessors of grace, and are truly converted. In the lips of an
          ungodly man it is entirely out of place. Doth not one say, |Ye are of
          your father the devil, for his works ye do?| Why, then, should ye mock
          God by saying, |Our Father which art in heaven.| For how can he be
          your Father? Have ye two Fathers? And if he be a Father, where is his
          honor? Where is his love? You neither honor nor love him, and yet you
          presumptuously and blasphemously approach him, and say, |Our Father,|
          when your heart is attached still to sin, and your life is opposed to
          his law, and you therefore prove yourself to be an heir of wrath, and
          not a child of grace! Oh! I beseech you, leave off sacrilegiously
          employing these sacred words; and until you can in sincerity and truth
          say, |Our Father which art in heaven,| and in your lives seek to honor
          his holy name, do not offer to him the language of the hypocrite,
          which is an abomination to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I very much question also, whether this prayer was intended to be used
          by Christ's own disciples as a constant form of prayer. It seems to me
          that Christ gave it as a model, whereby we are to fashion all our
          prayers, and I think we may use it to edification, and with great
          sincerity and earnestness, at certain times and seasons. I have seen
          an architect form the model of a building he intends to erect of
          plaster or wood; but I never had an idea that it was intended for me
          to live in. I have seen an artist trace on a piece of brown paper,
          perhaps, a design which he intended afterwards to work out on more
          costly stuff; but I never imagined the design to be the thing itself.
          This prayer of Christ is a great chart, as it were: but I cannot cross
          the sea on a chart. It is a map; but a man is not a traveler because
          he puts his fingers across the map. And so a man may use this form of
          prayer, and yet be a total stranger to the great design of Christ in
          teaching it to his disciples. I feel that I cannot use this prayer to
          the omission of others. Great as it is, It does not express all I
          desire to say to my Father which is in heaven. There are many sins
          which I must confess separately and distinctly; and the various other
          petitions which this prayer contains require, I feel, to be expanded,
          when I come before God in private; and I must pour out my heart in the
          language which his Spirit gives me; and more than that, I must trust
          in the Spirit to speak the unutterable groanings of my spirit, when my
          lips cannot actually express all the emotions of my heart. Let none
          despise this prayer; it is matchless, and if we must have forms of
          prayer, let us have this first, foremost, and chief; but let none
          think that Christ would tie his disciples to the constant and only use
          of this. Let us rather draw near to the throne of the heavenly grace
          with boldness, as children coming to a father, and let us tell forth
          our wants and our sorrows in the language which the Holy Spirit
          teacheth us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, coming to the text, there are several things we shall have to
          notice here. And first, I shall dwell for a few minutes upon the
          double relationship mentioned: |Our Father which art in heaven.| There
          is sonship -- |Father;| there is brotherhood, for it says, |Our
          Father;| and if he be the common father of us, then we must be
          brothers; for there are two relationships, sonship and brotherhood. In
          the next place, I shall utter a few words upon the spirit which is
          necessary to help us before we are able to utter this -- |The spirit
          of adoption,| whereby we can cry, |Our Father which art in heaven.|
          And then, thirdly, I shall conclude with the double argument of the
          text, for it is really an argument upon which the rest of the prayer
          is based. |Our Father which art in heaven,| is, as it were, a strong
          argument used before supplication itself is presented.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, THE DOUBLE RELATIONSHIP IMPLIED IN THE TEXT.</p>
        <p>
          We take the first one. Here is sonship -- |Our Father which art in
          heaven.| How are we to understand this, and in what sense are we the
          sons and daughters of God? Some say that the Fatherhood of God is
          universal, and that every man, from the fact of his being created by
          God, is necessarily God's son, and that therefore every man has a
          right to approach the throne of God, and say, |Our Father which art in
          heaven.| To that I must demur. I believe that in this prayer we are to
          come before God, looking upon him not as our Father through creation,
          but as our Father through adoption and the new birth. I will very
          briefly state my reasons for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have never been able to see that creation necessarily implies
          fatherhood. I believe God has made many things that are not his
          children. Hath he not made the heavens and the earth, the sea and the
          fullness thereof? and are they his children? You say these are not
          rational and intelligent beings; but he made the angels, who stand in
          an eminently high and holy position, are they his children? |Unto
          which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son?| I do not
          find, as a rule, that angels are called the children of God; and I
          must demur to the idea that mere creation brings God necessarily into
          the relationship of a Father. Doth not the potter make vessels of
          clay? But is the potter the father of the vase, or of the bottle? No,
          beloved, it needs something beyond creation to constitute the
          relationship, and those who can say, |Our Father which art in heaven,|
          are something more than God's creatures: they have been adopted into
          his family. He has taken them out of the old black family in which
          they were born; he has washed them. and cleansed them, and given them
          a new name and a new spirit, and made them |heirs of God, and
          joint-heirs with Christ;| and all this of his own free, sovereign,
          unmerited, distinguishing grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And having adopted them to be his children, he has in the next place,
          regenerated them by the Spirit of the living God. He has |begotten
          them again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
          from the dead,| and no man hath a right to claim God as his Father,
          unless he feeleth in his soul, and believeth, solemnly, through the
          faith of God's election, that he has been adopted into the one family
          of which is in heaven and earth, and that he has been regenerated or
          born again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This relationship also involves love, If God be my Father, he loves
          me. And oh, how he loves me! When God is a Husband he is the best of
          husbands. Widows, somehow or other, are always well eared for. When
          God is a Friend, he is the best of friends, and sticketh closer than a
          brother; and when he is a Father he is the best of fathers. O fathers!
          perhaps ye do not know how much ye love your children. When they are
          sick ye find it out, for ye stand by their couches and ye pity them,
          as their little frames are writhing in pain. Well, |like as a father
          pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.| Ye know
          how ye love your children too, when they grieve you by their sin;
          anger arises, and you are ready to chasten them, but no sooner is the
          tear in their eye, than your hand is heavy, and you feel that you had
          rather smite yourself than smite them; and every time you smite them
          you seem to cry, |Oh that I should have thus to afflict my child for
          his sin! Oh that I could suffer in his stead!| And God, even our
          Father, |doth not afflict willingly.| Is not that a sweet thing? He
          is, as it were, compelled to it; even the Eternal arm is not willing
          to do it; it is only his great love and deep wisdom that brings down
          the blow. But if you want to know your love to your children, you will
          know it most if they die. David knew that he loved his son Absalom,
          but he never knew how much he loved him till he heard that he had been
          slain, and that he had been buried by Joshua |Precious in the sight of
          the Lord is the death of his saints.| He knows then how deep and pure
          is the love that death can never sever, and the terrors of eternity
          never can unbind. But, parents, although ye love your children much,
          and ye know it, ye do not know, and ye cannot tell how deep is the
          unfathomable abyss of the love of God to you. Go out at midnight and
          consider the heavens, the work of God's fingers, the moon and the
          stars which he hath ordained; and I am sure you will say, |What is
          man, that thou shouldst be mindful of him?| But, more than all, you
          will wonder, not at your loving him, but that while he has all these
          treasures, he should set his heart upon so insignificant a creature as
          man. And the sonship that God has given us is not a mere name; there
          is all our Father's great heart given to us in the moment when be
          claims us as his sons.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if this sonship involves the love of God to us, it involves also,
          the duty of love to God. Oh! heir of heaven, if thou art God's child,
          wilt thou not love thy Father? What son is there that loveth not his
          father? Is he not less than human if he loveth not his sire? Let his
          name be blotted from the book of remembrance that loveth not the woman
          that brought him forth, and the father that begat him. And we, the
          chosen favourites of heaven, adopted and regenerated, shall not we
          loose him? Shall we not say, |Whom have I in heaven but thee, and
          there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison with thee? My
          father, I will give thee my heart; thou shalt be the guide of my
          youth; thou dost love me, and the little heart that I have shall be
          all thine own for ever.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if we say |Our Father which art in heaven,| we must
          recollect that our being sons involves the duty of obedience to God.
          When I say |My Father,| it is not for me to rise up and go in
          rebellion against his wishes; if he be a father, let me note his
          commands, and let me reverentially obey; if he hath said |Do this,|
          let me do it, not because I dread him, but because I love him; and if
          he forbids me to do anything, let me avoid it. There are some persons
          in the world who have not the spirit of adoption, and they can never
          be brought to do a thing unless they see some advantage to themselves
          in it; but with the child of God, there is no motive at all; he can
          boldly say, |I have never done a right thing since I have followed
          Christ because I hoped to get to heaven by it, nor have I ever avoided
          a wrong thing because I was afraid of being damned.| For the child of
          God knows his good works do not make him acceptable to God, for he was
          acceptable to God by Jesus Christ long before he had any good works;
          and the fear of hell does not affect him, for he knows that he is
          delivered from that, and shall never come into condemnation, having
          passed from death unto life. He acts from pure love and gratitude, and
          until we come to that state of mind, I do not think there is such a
          thing as virtue; for if a man has done what is called a virtuous
          action because he hoped to get to heaven or to avoid hell by it, whom
          has he served? Has he not served himself? and what is that but
          selfishness? But the man who has no hell to fear and no heaven to
          gain, because heaven is his own and hell he never can enter, that man
          is capable of virtue; for he says --
        </p>
        <p>|Now for the love I bear his name,</p>
        <p>What was my gain I count my loss;</p>
        <p>I pour contempt on all my shame,</p>
        <p>And nail my glory to his cross| --</p>
        <p>
          to his cross who loved, and lived, and died for me who loved him not,
          but who desires now to love him with all my heart, and soul, and
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now permit me to draw your attention to one encouraging thought
          that may help to cheer the downcast and Satan-tempted child of God.
          Sonship is a thing which all the infirmities of our flesh, and all the
          sins into which we are hurried by temptation, can never violate or
          weaken. A man hath a child; that child on a sudden is bereaved of its
          senses; it becomes an idiot. What a grief that is to a father, for a
          child to become a lunatic or an idiot, and to exist only as an animal,
          apparently without a soul! But the idiot child is a child, and the
          lunatic child is a child still; and if we are the fathers of such
          children they are ours, and all the idiocy and all the lunacy that can
          possibly befall them can never shake the fact that they are our sons.
          Oh! what a mercy, when we transfer this to God's case and ours! How
          foolish we are sometimes -- how worse than foolish! We may say as
          David did, |I was as a beast before thee.| God brings before us the
          truths of his kingdom; we cannot see their beauty, we cannot
          appreciate them; we seem to be as if we were totally demented
          ignorant, unstable, weary, and apt to slide. But, thanks be unto God,
          we are his children still! And if there be anything worse that can
          happen to a father than his child becoming a lunatic or an idiot, it
          is when he grows up to be wicked. It is well said, |Children are
          doubtful blessings.| I remember to have heard one say, and, as I
          thought, not very kindly, to a mother with an infant at her breast --
          |Woman! you may be suckling a viper there.| It stung the mother to the
          quick, and it was not needful to have said it. But how often is it the
          fact, that the child that has hung upon its mother's breast, when it
          grows up, brings that mother's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave!
        </p>
        <p>|Oh! sharper than a serpent's tooth</p>
        <p>To have a thankless child!|</p>
        <p>
          ungodly, vile, debauched -- a blasphemer! But mark, brethren: if he be
          a child he cannot lose his childship, nor we our fatherhood, be he who
          or what he may. Let him be transported beyond the seas, he is still
          our son; let us deny him the house because his conversation might lead
          others of our children into sin, yet our son he is, and must be, and
          when the sod shall cover his head and ours, |father and son| shall
          still be on the tombstone. The relationship never can be severed as
          lone as time shall last. The prodigal was his father's son, when he
          was amongst the harlots, and when he was feeding swine; and God's
          children are God's children anywhere and everywhere, and shall be even
          unto the end. Nothing can sever that sacred tie, or divide us from his
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another thought that may cheer the Little-faiths and
          Feeble minds. The fatherhood of God is common to all his children. Ah!
          Little-faith, you have often looked up to Mr. Great-heart, and you
          have said, |Oh that I had the courage of Great-heart, that I could
          wield his sword and cut old giant Grim in pieces! Oh that I could
          fight the dragons, and that I could overcome the lions! But I am
          stumbling at every straw, and a shadow makes me afraid.| List thee,
          Little-faith. Great-heart is God's child, and you are God's child too;
          and Great-heart is not a whit more God's child than you are. David was
          the son of God, but not more the son of God than thou. Peter and Paul,
          the highly-favored apostles, were of the family of the Most High; and
          so are you. You have children yourselves; one is a son grown up, and
          out in business, perhaps, and you have another, a little thing still
          in arms. Which is most your child the little one or the big one? |Both
          alike,| you say. |This little one is my child near my heart and the
          big one is my child too.| And so the little Christian is as much a
          child of God as the great one.
        </p>
        <p>|This cov'nant stands secure,</p>
        <p>Though earth's old pillars bow;</p>
        <p>The strong, the feeble, and the weak,</p>
        <p>Are one in Jesus now;|</p>
        <p>
          and they are one in the family of God, and no one is ahead of the
          other. One may have more grace than another, but God does not love one
          more than another. One may be an older child than another, but he is
          not more a child; one may do more mighty works, and may bring more
          glory to his Father, but he whose name is the least in the kingdom of
          heaven is as much the child of God as he who stands among the king's
          mighty men. Let this cheer and comfort us, when we draw near to God
          and say, |Our Father which art in heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I will make but one more remark before I leave this point, namely,
          this, -- that our being the children of God brings with it innumerable
          privileges. Time would fail me, if I were to attempt to read the long
          roll of the Christian's joyous privileges. I am God's child: if so, he
          will clothe me; my shoes shall be iron and brass; he will array me
          with the robe of my Saviour's righteousness, for he has said, |Bring
          forth the best robe and put it on him,| and he has also said that he
          will put a crown of pure gold upon my head and inasmuch as I am a
          king's son, I shall have a royal crown. Am I his child? Then he will
          feed me; my bread shall be given me, and my water shall be sure; he
          that feeds the ravens will never let his children starve. If a good
          husbandman feeds the barn-door fowl, and the sheep and the bullocks,
          certainly his children shall not starve. Does my Father deck the lily,
          and shall I go naked? Does he feed the fowls of the heaven that sow
          not, neither do they reap, and shall I feel necessity? God forbid! My
          Father knoweth what things I have need of before I ask him, and he
          will give me all I want. If I be his child, then I have a portion in
          his heart here, and I shall have a portion in his house above. for |if
          children then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,| |If we
          suffer with him we shall be also glorified together.| And oh!
          brethren, what a prospect this opens up! The fact of our being heirs
          of God and joint-heirs with Christ, proves that all things are ours --
          the gift of God, the purchase of a Saviour's blood.
        </p>
        <p>|This world is ours, and worlds to come;</p>

          Are there crowns? They are mine if I be an heir. Are there thrones?
          Are there dominions? Are there harps, palm branches, white robes? Are
          there glories that eye hath not seen? and is there music that ear hath
          not heard? All these are mine, if I be a child of God. |And it doth
          not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall
          appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.| Talk of
          princes, and kings, and potentates: Their inheritance is but a pitiful
          foot of land, across which the bird's wing can soon direct its flight;
          but the broad acres of the Christian cannot be measured by eternity.
          He is rich, without a limit to his wealth. he is blessed, without a
          boundary to his bliss. All this, and more than I can enumerate, is
          involved in our being able to say, |Our Father which art in heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The second tie of the text is brotherhood. It does not say my Father,
          but our Father. Then it seems there are a great many in the family. I
          will be very brief on this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Our Father.| When you pray that prayer, remember you have a good many
          brothers and sisters that do not know their Father yet, and you must
          include them all; for all God's elect ones, though they be uncalled as
          yet, are still his children, though they know it not. In one of
          Krummacher's beautiful little parables there is a story like this:
          |Abraham sat one day in the grove at Mamre, leaning his head on his
          hand, and sorrowing. Then his son Isaac came to him, and said, My
          father, why mournest thou? what aileth thee?' Abraham answered and
          said, My soul mourneth for the people of Canaan, that they know not
          the Lord, but walk in their own ways, in darkness and foolishness.'
          Oh, my father,' answered the son, is it only this? Let not thy heart
          be sorrowful; for are not these their own ways?' Then the patriarch
          rose up from his seat, and said, Come now, follow me.' And he led the
          youth to a hut. and said to him, Behold.' There was a child which was
          an imbecile, and the mother sat weeping by it. Abraham asked her, Why
          weepest thou? Then the mother said, Alas, this my son eateth and
          drinketh, and we minister unto him; but he knows not the face of his
          father, nor of his mother. Thus his life is lost, and this source of
          joy is sealed to him.' | Is not that a sweet little parable, to teach
          us how we ought to pray for the many sheep that are not yet of the
          fold, but which must be brought in? We ought to pray for them, because
          they do not know their Father. Christ has bought them, and they do not
          know Christ; the Father has loved them from before the foundation of
          the world, and yet, they know not the face of their Father. When thou
          sayest |Our Father,| think of the many of thy brothers and sisters
          that are in the back streets of London, that are in the dens and caves
          of Satan. Think of thy poor brother that is intoxicated with the
          spirit of the devil; think of him, led astray to infamy, and lust, and
          perhaps to murder, and in thy prayer pray thou for them who know not
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Our Father.| That, then, includes those of God's children who differ
          from us in their doctrine. Ah! there are some that differ from us as
          wide as the poles; but yet they are God's children. Come, Mr. Bigot,
          do not kneel down, and say, |My Father,| but |Our Father.| |If you
          please, I cannot put in Sir. So-and-So, for I think he is a heretic.|
          Put him in, sir. God has put him in, and you must put him in too, and
          say, |Our Father.| Is it not remarkable how very much alike all God's
          people are upon their knees? Some time ago at a prayer-meeting I
          called upon two brothers in Christ to pray one after another, the one
          a Wesleyan and the other a strong Calvinist, and the Wesleyan prayed
          the most Calvinistic prayer of the two, I do believe -- at least, I
          could not tell which was which. I listened to see if I could not
          discern some peculiarity even in their phraseology, but there was
          none. |Saints in prayer appear as one.| for when they get on their
          knees, they are all compelled to say |Our Father,| and all their
          language afterwards is of the same sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          When thou prayest to God put in the poor; for is he not the Father of
          many of the poor, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, though they
          be poor in this world. Come my sister, if thou bowest thy knee amid
          the rustling of silk and satin, yet remember the cotton and the print.
          My brother, is there wealth in thy hand, yet I pray thee, remember thy
          brethren of the horny hand and the dusty brow; remember those who
          could not wear what thou wearest, nor eat what thou eatest, but are as
          Lazarus compared with thee, while thou art as Dives. Pray for them;
          put them all in the same prayer and say, |Our Father.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And pray for those that are divided from us by the sea -- those that
          are in heathen lands, scattered like precious salt in the midst of
          this world's putrefaction. Pray for all that name the name of Jesus,
          and let thy prayer be a great and comprehensive one. |Our Father,
          which art in heaven.| And after thou hast prayed that rise up and act
          it. Say not |Our Father,| and then look upon thy brethren with a sneer
          or a frown. I beseech thee, live like a brother, and act like a
          brother Help the needy; cheer the sick; comfort the faint-hearted; go
          about doing good, minister unto the suffering people of God, wherever
          thou findest them, and let the world take knowledge of thee, that thou
          art when on thy feet what thou art upon thy knees -- that thou art a
          brother unto all the brotherhood of Christ, a brother born for
          adversity, like thy Master himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus expounded the double relationship, I have left myself
          but little time for a very important part of the subject, namely, THE
          SPIRIT OF ADOPTION.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am extremely puzzled and bewildered how to explain to the ungodly
          what is the spirit with which we must be filled, before we can pray
          this prayer. If I had a foundling here, one who had never seen either
          father or mother, I think I should have a very great difficulty in
          trying to make him understand what are the feelings of a child towards
          its father. Poor little thing, he has been under tutors and governors;
          he has learned to respect them for their kindness, or to fear them for
          their austerity, but there never can be in that child's heart that
          love towards tutor or governor, however kind he may be, that there is
          in the heart of another child towards his own mother or father. There
          is a nameless charm there: we cannot describe or understand it: it is
          a sacred touch of nature, a throb in the breast that God has put
          there, and that cannot be taken away. The fatherhood is recognized by
          the childship of the child. And what is that spirit of a child -- that
          sweet spirit that makes him recognize and love his father? I cannot
          tell you unless you are a child yourself, and then you will know. And
          what is |the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father?| I
          cannot tell you; but if you have felt it you will know it. It is a
          sweet compound of faith that knows God to be my Father, love that
          loves him as my Father, joy that rejoices in him as my Father, fear
          that trembles to disobey him because he is my Father and a confident
          affection and trustfulness that relies upon him, and casts itself
          wholly upon him, because it knows by the infallible witness of the
          Holy Spirit, that Jehovah, the God of earth and heaven, is the Father
          of my heart. Oh! have you ever felt the spirit of adoption? There is
          nought like it beneath the sky. Save heaven itself there is nought
          more blissful than to enjoy that spirit of adoption. Oh! when the wind
          of trouble is blowing and waves of adversity are rising, and the ship
          is reeling to the rock how sweet then to say |My Father,| and to
          believe that his strong hand is on the helm! -- when the bones are
          aching, and when the loins are filled with pain, and when the cup is
          brimming with wormwood and gall, to say |My Father,| and seeing that
          Father's hand holding the cup to the lip, to drink it steadily to the
          very dregs because we can say, |My Father, not my will, but thine be
          done.| Well says Martin Luther, in his Exposition of the Galatians,
          |there is more eloquence in that word, Abba. Father,' than in all the
          orations of Demosthenes or Cicero put together.| |My Father!| Oh!
          there is music there; there is eloquence there; there is the very
          essence of heaven's own bliss in that word, | My Father,| when applied
          to God, and when said by us with an unfaltering tongue, through the
          inspiration of the Spirit of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hearers, have you the spirit of adoption? If not, ye are miserable
          men. May God himself bring you to know him! May he teach you your need
          of him! May he lead you to the cross of Christ, and help you to look
          to your dying Brother! May he bathe you in the blood that flowed from
          his open wounds, and then, accepted in the beloved, may you rejoice
          that you have the honor to be one of that sacred family.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, in the last place, I said that there was in the title, A
          DOUBLE ARGUMENT. |Our Father.| That is, |Lord, hear what I have got to
          say. Thou art my Father.| If I come before a judge I have no right to
          expect that he shall hear me at any particular season in aught that I
          have to say. If I came merely to crave for some boon or benefit to
          myself, if the law were on my side, then I could demand an audience at
          his hands; but when I come as a law-breaker, and only come to crave
          for mercy, or for favors I deserve not, I have no right to expect to
          be heard. But a child, even though he is erring, always expects his
          father will hear what he has to say. |Lord, if I call thee King thou
          wilt say, Thou art a rebellious subject; get thee gone.' If I call
          thee Judge thou wilt say, Be still, or out of thine own mouth will I
          condemn thee.' If I call thee Creator thou wilt say unto me It
          repenteth me that I made man upon the earth.' If I call thee my
          Preserver thou wilt say unto me, I have preserved thee, but thou hast
          rebelled against me.' But if I call thee Father, all my sinfulness
          doth not invalidate my claim. If thou be my Father, then thou lovest
          me; if I be thy child, then thou wilt regard me, and poor though my
          language be, thou wilt not despise it.| If a child were called upon to
          speak in the presence of a number of persons, how very much alarmed he
          would be lest he should not use right language. I may sometimes feel
          when I have to address a mighty auditory, lest I should not select
          choice words, full well knowing that if I were to preach as I never
          shall, like the mightiest of orators I should always have enough of
          carping critics to rail at me. But if I had my Father here and if you
          could all stand in the relationship of father to me, I should not be
          very particular what language I used. When I talk to my Father I am
          not afraid he will misunderstand me; if I put my words a little out of
          place he understands my meaning somehow. When we are little children
          we only prattle; still our father understands us. Our children talk a
          great deal more like Dutchmen than Englishmen when they begin to talk,
          and strangers come in and my, |Dear me, what is the child talking
          about?| But we know what it is and though in what they say there may
          not be an intelligible sound that any one could print, and a reader
          make it out, we know they have got certain little wants, and having a
          way of expressing their desires, and we can understand them. So when
          we come to God, our prayers are little broken things; we cannot put
          them together but our Father, he will hear us. Oh! what a beginning is
          |Our Father,| to a prayer full of faults, and a foolish prayer
          perhaps, a prayer in which are going to ask what we ought not to ask
          for! |Father, forgive the language! forgive the matter!| As one dear
          brother said the other day at the prayer meeting. He could not get on
          in prayer, and he finished up on a sudden by saying, |Lord, I cannot
          pray to-night as I should wish; I cannot put the words together; Lord,
          take the meaning take the meaning,| and sat down. That is just what
          David said once, |Lo, all my desire is before thee| -- not my words,
          but my desire, and God could read it. We should say, |Our Father,|
          because that is a reason why God should hear what we have to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another argument. |Our Father.| |Lord, give me what I
          want.| If I come to a stranger, I have no right to expect he will give
          it me. He may out of his charity; but if I come to a father, I have a
          claim, a sacred claim. My Father, I shall have no need to use
          arguments to move thy bosom; I shall not have to speak to thee as the
          beggar who crieth in the street: for because thou art my Father thou
          knowest my wants, and thou art willing to relieve me. It is thy
          business to relieve me; I can come confidently to thee, knowing thou
          wilt give me all I want. If we ask our Father for anything when we are
          little children, we are under an obligation certainly; but it is an
          obligation we never feel. If you were hungry and your father fed you,
          would you feel an obligation like you would if you went into the house
          of a stranger? You go into a stranger's house trembling, and you tell
          him you are hungry. Will he feed you? He says yes, he will give you
          somewhat; but if you go to your father's table, almost without asking,
          you sit down as a matter of course, and feast to your full, and you
          rise and go, and feel you are indebted to him; but there is not a
          grievous sense of obligation. Now, we are all deeply under obligation
          to God, but it is a child's obligation -- an obligation which impels
          us to gratitude, but which does not constrain us to feel that we have
          been demeaned by it. Oh! if he were not my Father, how could I expect
          that he would relieve my wants? But since he is my Father, he will, he
          must hear my prayers, and answer the voice of my crying, and supply
          all my needs out of the riches of his fullness in Christ Jesus the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Has your father treated you badly lately? I have this word to you,
          then; your father loves you quite as much when he treats you roughly
          as when he treats you kindly. There is often more love in an angry
          father's heart than there is in the heart of a father who is too kind.
          I will suppose a case. Suppose there were two fathers, and their two
          sons went away to some remote part of the earth where idolatry is
          still practiced. Suppose these two sons were decoyed and deluded into
          idolatry. The news comes to England, and the first father is very
          angry. His son, his own son, has forsaken the religion of Christ and
          become an idolater. The second father says, |Well, if it will help him
          in trade I don't care, if he gets on the better by it, all well and
          good.| Now, which loves most, the angry father, or the father who
          treats the matter with complacency? Why, the angry father is the best.
          He loves his son; therefore he cannot give away his son's soul for
          gold. Give me a father that is angry with my sins, and that seeks to
          bring me back, even though it be by chastisement. Thank God you have
          got a father that can be angry, but that loves you as much when he is
          angry as when he smiles upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go away with that upon your mind, and rejoice. But if you love not God
          and fear him not, go home, I beseech you, to confess your sins, and to
          seek mercy through the blood of Christ; and may this sermon be made
          useful in bringing you into the family of Christ though you have
          strayed from him long; and though his love has followed you long in
          vain, may it now find you, and bring you to his house rejoicing!
