          1. The rule of truth which we hold, is, that there is one God
          Almighty, who made all things by His Word, and fashioned and formed,
          out of that which had no existence, all things which exist. Thus saith
          the Scripture, to that effect |By the Word of the Lord were the
          heavens established, and all the might of them, by the spirit of His
          mouth.| And again, |All things were made by Him, and without Him was
          nothing made.| There is no exception or deduction stated; but the
          Father made all things by Him, whether visible or invisible, objects
          of sense or of intelligence, temporal, on account of a certain
          character given them, or eternal; and these eternal things He did not
          make by angels, or by any powers separated from His Ennoea. For God
          needs none of all these things, but is He who, by His Word and Spirit,
          makes, and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all things
          into existence, -- He who formed the world (for the world is of all),
          -- He who fashioned man, -- He [who] is the God of Abraham, and the
          God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, above whom there is no other God,
          nor initial principle, nor power, nor pleroma, -- He is the Father of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, as we shall prove. Holding, therefore, this
          rule, we shall easily show, notwithstanding the great variety and
          multitude of their opinions, that these men have deviated from the
          truth; for almost all the different sects of heretics admit that there
          is one God; but then, by their pernicious doctrines, they change [this
          truth into error], even as the Gentiles do through idolatry, -- thus
          proving themselves ungrateful to Him that created them. Moreover, they
          despise the workmanship of God, speaking against their own salvation,
          becoming their own bitterest accusers, and being false witnesses
          [against themselves]. Yet, reluctant as they may be, these men shall
          one day rise again in the flesh, to confess the power of Him who
          raises them from the dead; but they shall not be numbered among the
          righteous on account of their unbelief.

          2. Since, therefore, it is a complex and multiform task to detect and
          convict all the heretics, and since our design is to reply to them all
          according to their special characters, we have judged it necessary,
          first of all, to give an account of their source and root, in order
          that, by getting a knowledge of their most exalted Bythus, thou mayest
          understand the nature of the tree which has produced such fruits.
