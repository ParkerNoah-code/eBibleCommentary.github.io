        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.482)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 30th, 1862, by</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
          perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
          merchant? Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men
          are about it, of the valiant of Israel. They all hold swords, being
          expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear
          in the night. King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of
          Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
          gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with
          love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. Go forth, O ye daughters of
          Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother
          crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the
          gladness of his heart.| -- Solomons Song 3:6-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          GREAT PRINCES IN THE EAST are in the habit of travelling in splendid
          palanquins, which are at the same time chariots and beds. The person
          reclines within, screened by curtains from public view; a body-guard
          protects the equipage from robbers, and blazing torches light up the
          path along which the travelers proceed. King Solomon, in this Song,
          describes the Church of Christ, and Christ himself, as travailing
          through the world in such a palanquin. The day is coming when both our
          divine Lord and his chosen bride shall be revealed in glory before the
          eyes of all men. The present age is the period of concealment -- the
          mystical Solomon and his beloved Solyma are both on earth, but they
          are unseen of men; like the ark of old they dwell within curtains;
          only the anointed priests of God can discern their beauties, and even
          these gaze rather by faith than by sight. |Lo I am with you alway,
          even unto the end of the world,| is certainly true, for Jesus is here;
          but equally correct is that word of Peter, |Whom having not seen, ye
          love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice
          with joy unspeakable and full of glory.| He is here in the reality,
          power, and influence of his presence, but he is not here as to the
          visibility of his kingdom and person, for we wait with our loins girt
          about, and with patience of hope, until the revelation of Jesus
          Christ. The portion of the blessed canticle now before us is, we
          think, descriptive of the progress of the hidden Christ through the
          world. He has been borne along, in very truth, but he himself has been
          so little perceived of men, that they even ask the question, |Who is
          this that cometh out of the wilderness?| He is not now manifested
          openly to men. If any should say, |Lo here!| or |Lo there! this is
          Christ!| believe them not, for Christ is not as yet seen. When he doth
          come he shall be as perceptible as the lightning's flash, which every
          man's eye discerneth without the need of an instructor. So, also, with
          his true Church. She also is hidden like her Lord, and though her
          hand, her foot, or her face may be sometimes seen, yet the whole elect
          body has never yet been beheld. If any say, |Lo, here is the Church of
          Christ!| or |Lo there!| believe them not, for it is a fact that there
          is no corporation of men of which we can say exclusively or even
          universally, |Lo, this is the Church of Christ.| There are tares
          growing with the wheat in the best guarded field, and on the other
          hand no one enclosure contains all the wheat. The true Church of
          Christ is scattered here and there, it is found amongst all
          denominations, and there is not one denomination of which you can say,
          |This only is the Church of Christ, or all its members belong to the
          body of Christ's spouse.| Just now the mystical bride is in a certain
          sense as invisible as her husband. Behold, then, the betrothed ones
          carried through the world in the sumptuous chariot of which we have to
          speak this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must now claim your attention while I notice, first, the glory of
          the progress of Christ through the world, as described in the sixth
          verse; secondly, the security of Christ's cause, as represented in thy
          seventh and eighth; thirdly, the superlative excellence of it, as
          described in the ninth and tenth; and lastly, our joyful duties with
          regard to it, as openly declared in the eleventh.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE MAGNIFICENT PROGRESS, THE GLORIOUS ON-GOING OF THE
          CHURCH AND HER LORD THROUGH THE WORLD.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
          perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
          merchant?| The equipage excites the attention of the on-looker; his
          curiosity is raised, and he asks, |Who is this?| Now, in the first
          progress of the Christian Church, in her very earliest days, there
          were persons who marvelled greatly; and though they set down the
          wonders of the day of Pentecost to drunkenness, yet |they were all
          amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?|
          In after years, many a heathen philosopher said, |What is this new
          power which is breaking the idols in pieces, changing old customs,
          making even thrones unsafe-what is this?| By-and-bye, in the age of
          the Reformation, there were cowled monks, cardinals in their red hats,
          and bishops, and princes, and emperors, who all said, |What is this?
          What strange doctrine has come to light?| In the times of the modern
          reformation, a century ago, when God was pleased to revive his Church
          through the instrumentality of Whitfield and his brethren, there were
          many who said, |What is this new enthusiasm, this Methodism? Whence
          came it, and what power is this which it wields?| And, doubtless,
          whenever God shall be pleased to bring forth his Church in power, and
          to make her mighty among the sons of men, the ignorance of men will be
          discovered breaking forth in yonder, for they will say, |Who is this?|
          Spiritual religion is as much a novelty now as in the day when Grecian
          sages scoffed at it on Mars' Hill. The true Church of God is a
          stranger and pilgrim still; an alien and a foreigner in every land; a
          speckled bird; a dove in the midst of ravens; a lily among thorns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ignorance of men concerning spiritual things is not, however,
          caused by the darkness of the things themselves, for Christ and his
          Church are the great lights of the world. When great personages
          traveled in their palanquins, and more especially on marriage
          processions, they were attended by a number of persons who, at night,
          carried high up in the air burning cressets which gave forth a blaze
          of light. Sometimes these lights were simply torches carried in the
          hands of running footmen; at other times they were a sort of iron
          basket lifted high into the air, upon poles, from which went up a
          pillar of smoke and flame. Our text says |Who is this that cometh out
          of the wilderness like pillars of smoke?| a beautiful illustration of
          the fact that wherever Christ and his cause are carried, light is a
          sure accompaniment. Into whatsoever region the gospel may journey, her
          every herald is a flash of light, her every minister a flaming fire.
          God maketh his Churches the golden candlesticks, and saith unto his
          children |Ye are the lights of the world,| is certainly as ever God
          said |Let there be light,| and there was light over the old creation,
          so does he say, whenever his Church advances, |Let there be light| and
          there is light. Dens of darkness, where the bats of superstition had
          folded their wings and hung themselves up for perpetual ease, have
          been disturbed by the glare of these divine flambeaux; the innermost
          caverns of superstition and sin, once black with a darkness which
          might be felt, have been visited with a light above the brightness of
          the sun. |The people which sat in darkness have seen a great light,
          and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light has
          sprung up.| Thus saith the Lord unto the nation where his kingdom
          cometh, |Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the
          Lord hath risen upon thee!| Bear ye the Church of Christ to the South
          Seas; carry Christ and his spouse in his palanquin to the Caffre, the
          Hottentot, or the Esquimaux, and everywhere the night of death is
          ended, and the morning with its glorious dawn has come. High lift your
          lamps, ye servants of our Lord. High lift up the cross of the
          Redeemer; for in him is light, and the light in the life of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you will tell me that our text rather speaks of |pillars of smoke|
          than of sparkling lamps. Brethren, the smoke is but the effect of the
          flame, and even the pillar of smoke is luminous. What is the smoke
          that has attended the Church? What but the deaths of her martrys, the
          sufferings of her confessors, the patient endurance of her valiant
          sons? Wherever she goes, the thick smoke of her suffering goeth up to
          heaven. |We are alway delivered unto death,| said the apostle. The
          cause of truth involves a perpetual sacrifice; her smoke ascendeth for
          ever. Black smoke I say it is in the eye of man, but unto God it is a
          sweet-smelling savor. Never did fat of rams, or the fat of kidnies of
          fed beasts, smell so sweetly before the Most High as the faith, the
          love, the courage, which has ascended up to heaven from the dauntless
          heroes of the Church in past ages when at the stake they have been
          faithful even unto death. Suffering, and grief, and woe are the lot of
          the spouse of the despised and rejected Savior, but all these are as
          things of nought if thereby she may scatter that terrible blackness
          which blinds the face of man and makes him a stranger to his God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It often happens that oriental monarchs of immense possessions, are
          not content with burning common coals in these cressets, but
          frequently consume sandal-wood and other woods which give forth a
          delightful smell; or else, if they use ordinary coals, they sprinkle
          upon them frankincense and myrrh, so that a delicious perfume is
          spread on all sides. In the olden times, they also went to great
          expense in obtaining drugs, which the merchants collected from all
          parts of the earth, and these were carefully compounded into the
          renowned |powders of the merchants,| which yielded a delicious variety
          of delicate perfumes, not to be produced by any one aromatic essence.
          Our inspired poet describes the travelling procession of the royal
          pair and fails not to dwell upon the delightful perfume of myrrh and
          frankincense, with all the powders of the merchant, |which make the
          wilderness smell as a garden of roses.| Wherever the Church of Christ
          proceeds, though her pathway is a desert, though she marches through a
          howling wilderness, she scatters the richest perfume. The page of
          history were only worthy to be blotted in oblivion were it not for the
          sweet odours which the Church has left upon it. Look at all past ages,
          and the track of the Church is still redolent with all the richest
          fragrance of human virtue and divine grace. Wherever the Church
          advances she makes manifest the savor of the knowledge of Christ in
          every place! Men believe in Jesus, and unto the Lord faith has all the
          fragrance of myrrh. They love Jesus; and love in the esteem of heaven
          is better than frankincense. Loving Christ they endeavor to be like
          him, till patience, humility, brotherly-kindness, truthfulness, and
          all things that are honest, lovely, and of good repute, like |powders
          of the merchant,| are spread abroad throughout the whole earth. Tell
          me where the Church is not, and I will tell you where sin reigns; tell
          me where Christ and his Church are carried, and I will tell you where
          you shall find every virtue that can adorn humanity, and every
          excellence that can magnify the excellence of the grace of God. If you
          would find an antidote for the deadly exhalations which lurk among
          this vorld's deserts of sin, if you would destroy the foul pestilence
          which reigns in the darkness of heathenism, of Popery, and of
          infidelity, cry unto the Mighty One -- |Arise, thou unknown traveler,
          arise, and bid thy servants carry thee into the midst of all this
          misery and death! The light of thy flaming torches shall scatter the
          darkness, and the buming of thy precious perfumes shall say unto evil
          -- 'Fold thy wings!' and unto the pestilence of sin -- 'Get thee back
          unto thy den!'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the ten wonders which Jewish tradition ascribes to the temple,
          we find that the rain never extinguished the fire of the wood which
          was laid in order upon the altar, nor did the wind ever conquer the
          pillar of smoke so as to disperse or bend it. Verily it is so with the
          Church of God, as she cometh out of the wilderness: who shall quench
          her flaming lamp, or stay the incense of her golden censers? Ride on,
          Great Prince, and bear thy spouse with thee in thy majestic chariot,
          till thou hast lit the world with thy divine light, and hast made it a
          temple filled with a cloud of incense of sweet smell to the nostrils
          of Jehovah!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have, secondly, to notice THE SECURITY OF CHRIST'S CHURCH AT
          ALL TIMES.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course when travelling through a wilderness, a royal procession was
          always in danger of attack. Arabs prowled around; wandering Bedouins
          were always prepared to fall upon the caravan; and more especially was
          this the case with a marriage procession, because then the robbers
          might expect to obtain many jewels, or, if not, a heavy ransom for the
          redemption of the bride or bridegroom by their friends. What shall I
          say of the attacks which have been made upon the Church of Christ, and
          upon Christ himself? They have been incessant. When one form of evil
          has been routed, another has presented itself. Evil teems with
          children. The frogs and lice of Egypt were not more numerous than the
          enemies of the Lord's anointed and his bride. Every day produces new
          battles. These attacks arise from all quarters; sometimes from the
          world, and sometimes, alas! from even professed members of the Church.
          Adversaries lurk everywhere, and until the Church and her Lord shall
          be revealed in the splendor of the Millennium, having left the
          wilderness for ever, we must expect to find her molested on every
          side. My dear brethren, we know that Christ's cause in the world is
          always safe because of divine protection, and because the legions of
          God's angels keep watch and ward over the saints. But we have
          something more tangible than this. Our gracious God has been pleased
          to commit unto men the ministry of Christ. |Unto the angels hath he
          not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.| The Lord
          ordaineth that chosen men should be the protectors of his Church; not
          that they have any power as of themselves to do anything, but He
          girdeth the weak with strength and maketh the feeble mighty; so then,
          men, even the sons of men stand in array around the travelling
          palanquin of Christ, to guard both the bridegroom and the bride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the 7th and 8th verses carefully, and you will notice that there
          are enough swordsmen. |Threescore valiant men are about it.| There are
          always enough men chosen of God to guard the Church. Poor Unbelief
          holds up her hands and cries -- |Ah! the good men are all dead; Zion
          is under a cloud; the Lord hath taken away the great men; we have no
          valiant defenders of the faith, none such as this crisis may require!|
          Ah! Unbelief, let the Lord say unto thee as he did unto Elias -- |Yet
          have I left me seven-thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not
          bowed unto Baal.| There shall be just as many warriors as the crisis
          shall require. We do not know where the men are to come from, but the
          Lord will provide. There may be sitting in the Sunday school to-day a
          child who shall one day shake this nation from one end to the other;
          there may be even here, unknown, obscure, and unobserved, the man whom
          God will make strong to rebuke the infamous infidelity of our age. We
          know not where the anointing rests. We, in our folly, would anoint
          Eliab or Abinadab, but God hath chosen David, the shepherd's boy, and
          he will bring him forth and teach him how to hurl the stone at
          Goliath's brow. Tremble not, neither be ye afraid; God who makes man
          and makes man's mouth, will find the sixty men when the sixty shall be
          needed. |The Lord gave the word, great was the company of them that
          published it.| The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
          shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that these warriors are men of the right mettle. |Yes,| says
          poor trembling Little-Faith, |we have hosts of men, but they are not
          like the greathearts of old; they have not the qualifications which
          the age requires.| Ah! but remember, about the bed of Solomon there
          are |threescore valiant men;| and glory be unto my Master, while I may
          not flatter the ministry, I must not dishonor him by believing that he
          has left his Church without valiant defenders. There are Luthers still
          living who bid defiance to all adversaries; men who can say, |We count
          not our lives dear unto us that we may finish our course with joy, and
          fulfill the ministry which the Lord hath delivered unto us.| Fear not;
          you may not at present know the valor of the Lord's body-guard, but
          when the Church's battle grows hotter than just now, suddenly there
          shall be seen a champion stalking to the front of the battle, and men
          shall say, |Who is this? How he wields that battle-axe! How he splits
          the armor of his foes! See how he piles them heaps on heaps, and
          mounts that hill of slaughtered enemies to smite a greater foe! Who is
          this?| And the answer shall be, |This is a man whom God hath found;
          the world knew not of him, but God has trained him in the camps of
          Dan, and now the Spirit moveth him to smite the Philistines.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Ah!| I think I hear you say, |but though there may be so many men,
          and men of the right sort, I am afraid they are not in the right
          place.| Look again at the text. It is written -- |Threescore valiant
          men are ABOUT IT;| that is, there are some on that side, and some on
          this, some before, and some behind; they are all round the travelling
          chariot of Christ. |I wish there might be one in our parish,| says
          one. Pray for him, and he who has promised to send you all good things
          may yet send him to you. |Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he may
          send forth laborers into his harvest.| It is singular how God
          sometimes raises a mighty man, in this denomination, then in that, and
          then in the other. Suppose any body of Christians should try to
          monopolize all the valiant men themselves; why, they could not do it,
          because every side of the royal bed must be guarded, and in his own
          place each man is set for the defense of the gospel. The Church is
          compassed about with mighties, who are under God to do great exploits.
          If the Lord guides the flight of sparrows, surely he knows how to
          dispose his ministers; and let the Church be well content to let them
          occupy their posts until the wilderness is past, and the glory shall
          be revealed. The Church often makes mistakes, and thinks she can make
          ministers, or at least choose their position. She can do no such
          thing. God sends the valiant man; all you can do is to recognize his
          valor, and accept him as your champion; beyond that you cannot go;
          this is God's work, not man's. A minister made by men, made valiant by
          human strength, had better betake himself at once ignominiously to his
          tent, for his disgrace will be certain. God who sends the men, knows
          where to put them, so that they may stand round about the bed, and
          leave no corner unprotected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that these men are all well armed. The text says expressly,
          |They all hold swords.| What swords are these? Every valiant man in
          Christ's Israel holds the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
          God. A man who is a good textuary will usually be a good divine; he
          who draws from the treasury of the written word will find his spoken
          word to be fruitful in profit to the people of God. If we use carnal
          reason; if we rely upon refinement, argument, eloquence, or any other
          form of the wisdom of man, we shall soon find our enemies will defeat
          us; but to ply the Word right and left; to give gospel cuts and
          strokes such as the devil himself cannot parry, this is to overcome
          the world through the Word of God. Besides this, and here is an
          opportunity for you all to carry swords -- every valiant man in God's
          Israel carries the sword of prayer, which is comparable to those huge
          two-handed swords of the olden time, which the soldier lifted up and
          brought down with such tremendous force, as to cleave a man in halves:
          prayer is a weapon which no man can effectually resist. If you know
          how to use it, bring it down upon your foeman's head, and woe unto
          him! I would to God that in this Church there were found many of these
          valiant men of Israel! Indeed, would God all the Lord's servants were
          prophets, that it might be said of all of you that you hold swords.
          Your holy lives can be swords with which to smite your enemies. The
          tongues with which you speak of Christ lovingly, tenderly,
          persuasively -- these may be weapons against our common enemy. Oh that
          when we hear the muster roll at last, it may be said of every
          Church-member that he held a sword! Do not tremble, ye timid ones, for
          the ark of the Lord; neither let your fears promote your unbelief; God
          knows full well how to give the right weapons to the right men, and
          his Church shall be secure even to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, my brethren, these men are not only well armed, but thy are
          well trained. They are all expert in war; men who have endured
          temptations themselves; men whose souls have been exercised, men who
          have slain both the lion and the bear, and are men of war from their
          youth. Christian ministers especially should be no novices, but both
          in the school of temptation, and in some school of the prophets, they
          should be disciplined for fight. May there be such found here! I look
          out daily for such among you as are taught of God, and much of my time
          is spent with our young soldiers to make them expert in war. O that
          the Lord would hear my prayers and bless our college with men, and
          means, and above all with his Spirit. Fools are not the men for this
          age. We want a sound knowledge of doctrine, practical power in
          preaching, and a thorough insight into the human heart; and where
          these by earnest prayer can be found in a man and further developed by
          careful teaching, we are bound to give our aid. Such men should be
          looked after, and no pains should be spared to bring them forth; in
          fact, dear friends, you ought to think it a high honor to be allowed
          to help in putting such men into working order. Oh! how I groan to get
          my friends to feel the importance of sending out trained young
          ministers. I give my time and my substance cheerfully, but when will
          the Christian Church help in this matter as it should?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, these men were not only well-trained, but you will see that
          they were always ready. Each man has his sword upon his thigh, ready
          to be drawn forth. I know some nominal ministers who seem to me to
          carry no sword at all. They keep a sheath, a very handsome sheath,
          with a hilt at the top and a stick inside. What is the good of such
          men? We want men to have swords in their sheaths, men who can speak
          with power, and have the demonstration of the Spirit and the power
          thereof resting upon them. Such men should wear their swords where
          they are to be got at, so that when the adversary comes they may dash
          at him at once. Rejoice, O daughter of Zion, thy Lord hath not left
          thee, even at this day, without some such men!
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe also that these men were watchful, for |they had their sword
          on their thigh because of fear in the night.| They never sleep, but
          watch always for the Church's interest. Pray ye that the Lord may
          raise up many such, who night and day with tears shall watch for the
          souls of men, and against the enemies of our Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, some of you may at times be alarmed when you hear of
          attacks made upon the Bible. At one time it was thought that ethnology
          would prove that the human race could not be one; and Moses was
          terribly abused by some who said it was not possible that all of us
          could have come of one pair. That battle was fought, and you hear
          nothing of it now; it is over; learning and argument in the hand of
          God has routed those antagonists. Then they pelted us with shells, and
          bones of lizards. Geology threatened to dig our graves; but we have
          lived all through that struggle, and we have found geology to be a
          great blessing, for it has shed a new light on the first chapter of
          Genesis, and made us understand a great deal better what it meant.
          Another Amalekite advances to combat; this time it is with figures and
          numbers; we are to be speared with arithmetic, and slain with algebra!
          And what will be the result of it? Why, it will do the Bible a world
          of good, for we shall understand it better. I thank God whenever the
          Bible is attacked; for all those who know the times and seasons, begin
          to study just that part of Scripture more carefully, and then we get a
          clearer light shed upon it, and we find ourselves more confirmed than
          ever that this is the very truth, and that God hath revealed it to us.
          |Well, but who will take this matter up?| I do not know, and I do not
          particularly care, but I know my Master has his threescore valiant men
          round about his bed, and that each man has his sword upon his thigh
          because of fear in the night, and never mind what the battle may be,
          the end of it will be for God's glory, and there shall be progress
          with the chariot of Christ through that which seemed as if it must
          overthrow it. Cast aside your fears; rejoice, and be glad, O daughter
          of Zion! Thy Lord is with thee in the travelling chariot, and the
          threescore valiant men are watching against thy foes.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Meanwhile, reposing in peace, let us notice THE EXCELLENCY OF
          THIS CHARIOT IN WHICH JESUS RIDES.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not difficult to convey to persons the most unacquainted with
          Eastern manners and customs, an idea of what this palanquin is. It is
          a sort of large sedan in which one or two persons may recline with
          ease. Of course, this palanquin could not be made of gold or silver,
          because then it would be too heavy for carriage; it must be made of
          wood; hence King Solomon made a bed, or chariot, or palanquin, of the
          wood of Lebanon. Then there needs to be four pillars supporting the
          covering and the curtains; the pillars thereof are of silver. The
          bottom of it should be something massive, in order to sustain the
          weight of the person; the bottom thereof is of gold. The canopy on the
          top, is a covering of purple. Since to lie on gold would be very
          unpleasant, it is covered with delicate, daintily wrought carpets; and
          so we have the bottom thereof paved, or rather carpeted with love for
          the daughters of Jerusalem. Some delicate devices of needlework adorn
          the bottom of this bed-chariot in which the king and his spouse
          recline during their journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrines of the gospel are comparable, for their antiquity, for
          their sweet fragrance, for their incorruptibility, to the wood of
          Lebanon. The gospel of Christ never decays; Jesus Christ the same
          yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Not one single truth, bears any sign
          of rot. And to those souls that are enlightened from above, the gospel
          gives forth a fragrance far richer than the wood of Lebanon.
        </p>
        <p>|No beams of cedar or of fir,</p>
        <p>Can with thy precious truth compare.|</p>
        <p>
          I rejoice to know concerning you as a Church, that the more you
          understand the doctrines of grace the better you love them. You are
          confirmed in the present faith, and well you may be, for our doctrine
          is worthy of your confidence. We are not afraid that any truth which
          Christ has uttered should be tried by the most stringent criticism,
          for not one single stone of all the bulwarks of Gospel doctrine can
          ever be removed out of its place. When cedars of Lebanon have yielded
          to the worm, even then shall the truth as it is in Jesus remain the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the silver pillars which bear up the canopy, to what should I
          liken them but to the attributes of God which support and guarantee
          the efficiency of the great atonement of Christ beneath which we are
          sheltered. There is the silver pillar of God's justice. He cannot, he
          will not smite the soul that hides beneath the cross of Christ. If
          Christ hath paid the debt, how is it possible that God should visit
          again a second time the iniquity of his people, first on their Surety,
          and then again on themselves? Then stands the next, the solid pillar
          of his power. |They shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them
          out of my hand; my Father which gave them me is greater than all, and
          none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.| Then on the other
          side is the pillar of his love, a silver pillar indeed, bright and
          sparkling to the eye; love unchanging and eternal, strong as the power
          and fast as the justice which bear up the canopy on the other side.
          And here on this side stands immutability, another column upon which
          the atonement rests. If God could change, then might he cast away his
          blood-bought; but |because I am God and change not, therefore ye sons
          of Jacob rejoice.| As for the covering of the chariot, it is of
          purple. I need not tell you where it was dyed. No Tyrian hues are
          mingled here. Look up, Christian, and delight thyself in that
          blood-red canopy which shelters thee from the sun by day and from the
          moon by night! From hell and heaven, from time and from eternity, art
          thou secured by this covering which is of purple. Oh! tempting theme
          to dilate upon the precious and glorious doctrine of atonement!
          Whenever our adversaries assail the Church, whatever may be the
          apparent object of their animosity, their real one is always the same,
          a desperate hatred to the great truth that God was in Christ
          reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
          them. Well, as they hate it, let us love it; and under it let us take
          our greatest delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the bottom of this palanquin, which is of gold, -- may not this
          represent the eternal purpose and counsel of God, that purpose which
          he formed in himself or ever the earth was? Pure was the decree of
          God, holy, wise, just, for his own glory, and most true; and as the
          precious things of the temple were all of gold, well may the basis of
          eternal love, an immutable and unchangeable decree, be compared to
          much fine gold. I do not know, brethren, how it is with you, but I
          find it most pleasant to have as the basis of my hope, the firm decree
          of God. Atonement covers me, I know, but still on this I must rest,
          Jehovah wills it; God decrees it; he hath said it, and it must be
          done; he hath commanded and it standeth fast. Oh! that golden
          sovereignty, whereon is written -- |I will have mercy on whom I will
          have mercy; it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth.|
          Dear brethren, the Apostle plainly tells us that this is the basis on
          which even the silver pillars rest, |for he hath blessed us with all
          spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus, according as he hath chosen us in
          him from before the foundation of the world.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, to make this all soft and pleasant to recline upon, here is
          pavement of needlework. Soft cushions of love on which to rest. There
          is a double meaning here, for both the bride and bridegroom find rest
          in love. Our Lord finds rest in the love of his people. |Here will I
          dwell for ever.| They do, as it were, make these carpets of
          needle-work in their love and affection for him, and in their trust
          and confidence in him; and here he rests. On the other hand, our
          Beloved spent his life to work for us our bed of rest, so that we must
          translate it |love of,| as well as love for the daughters of
          Jerusalem.| We rest in Christ's love; he rests in our love. Come, I
          need not explain further, brothers and sisters. Take your rest now to
          the full. You are married unto Christ; you are one with him; betrothed
          unto him in faithfulness, embraced in the arms of his affection. Fear
          not the noise of archers; the |threescore valiant men| protect you,
          and the king himself embraces you; now solace yourself with him; take
          your full of his sweet society, and say unto him from the bottom of
          your heart, |Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for his
          love is better than wine.| Leave fighting for the evidences to the
          valiant men who can do it; as for you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, rest
          upon your Lord's bosom; leave conflict to the men ordained to fight,
          the men expert in war; as for you, be you expert in communion;
          understand the motions of Jesus' heart; look unto the lustre of his
          loving eyes; behold his beauties; be ravished with his divine
          affection to you; and now let your soul be satisfied with favor, and
          be full of the lovingkindness of the Lord!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We close, then, by noticing THE DUTY OF EVERY BELIEVING HEART
          newest in connection with the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let every believer, while he recognizes himself as part of the Church
          inside the palanquin, yet look upon himself personally as one of the
          daughters of Zion, and let us each go forth this morning to meet King
          Solomon. It is not King David; King David is the type of Christ up to
          the time of his crucifixion -- |despised and rejected of men, a man of
          sorrows and acquainted with grief,| and yet King of the Jews. King
          Solomon is the type of Christ ever since the day when
        </p>
        <p>|They brought his chariot from above,</p>
        <p>To bear him to his throne.|</p>
        <p>
          and, with sound of trumpet, conducted him to his Father's
          presence-chamber above. Now it is King Solomon; King Solomon for
          wealth, for wisdom, for dignity, for honor, for peace. He is the
          Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the
          Prince of Peace, and therefore is he King Solomon going forth. Get up
          from your beds of sloth; rise from your chambers of ease; go forth, go
          forth to pray, to labor, to suffer; go forth to live in purity,
          leaving Babylon behind; go forth to walk with him alone, leaving even
          your kinsfolk and acquaintance if they will not follow with you.
          Wherefore tarriest thou at home when the King is abroad? |Behold the
          Bridegroom cometh, come ye forth to meet him,| and behold King
          Solomon. To-day let your eye rest upon him. Let your eye behold the
          head that to-day is crowned with glory, wearing many crowns. Behold
          ye, too, his hands which once were pierced, but are now grasping the
          scepter. Look to his girdle where swing the keys of heaven, and death,
          and hell. Look to his feet, once pierced with iron, but now set upon
          the dragon's head. Behold his legs, like fine brass, as if they glowed
          in a furnace. Look at his heart, that bosom which heaves with love to
          you, and when you have surveyed him from head to foot exclaim, |Yea,
          he is the chief among ten thousand, and altogether lovely.| Does sin
          prevail? Behold King Solomon. Have doubts and fears arisen? Behold
          King Jesus. Are you troubled, and does your enemy annoy you? Look up
          to him, behold king Solomon. I pray you remember the light in which
          you are to behold him. Do not think that Christ has lost his former
          power. Behold him as he was at Pentecost, with the crown wherewith his
          mother crowned him in the day of his espousals. Oh! how glorious was
          our Lord when the Church crowned him with her zeal, and the arrows
          went abroad, and three thousand fell slain by his right hand to be
          made alive by the breath of his mouth! Oh, how these early saints
          crowned him, when they brought of their substance and laid it at the
          apostle's feet, neither did any man count that ought he had was his
          own. They crowned him with their heart's purest love; the Church had
          on her brow her bridal-wreath, and her husband wore his nuptial crown.
          Behold him to-day as wearing that crown still, for he is the same
          Christ, and do you go forth to meet him, and labor for him, and love
          him as the first saints did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forget not that his mother is to crown him soon in the day of his
          espousals. He is our brother as well as our husband, and the Church is
          his mother as well as ours. Oh! she is to crown him soon! The day of
          his espousals draweth nigh. Hark! I hear the trumpet sound! Jesus
          comes, and his feet stand upon Mount Olivet; kings and princes lick
          the dust before him; he gathers sheaves of sceptres beneath his arm
          even as the mower gathereth wheat with the sickle. He treadeth on
          principalities and powers, the young lion and the dragon doth he
          trample under foot. And now his saints cry, |Hosanna, blessed is he
          that cometh in the name of the Lord.| The long-expected one is come,
          and his mother crowns him in the day of his espousals! Courage, poor
          heart, courage! Go forth and see King Solomon to-day as he is to lie,
          and remember,
        </p>
        <p>|It doth not yet appear</p>
        <p>How great we shall be made;</p>
        <p>But when we see our Savior here,</p>
        <p>We shall be like our Head.|</p>
        <p>
          When we look on Him; let us rejoice that this is to be our glory. We
          are to put off this sackcloth and put on scarlet and fine linen. The
          dust is to be wiped from our brow and the sweat from our face; the
          shackles are to be taken from our wrist, and the gyves from our legs;
          and we are to be emancipated, ennobled, glorified, made partners with
          Christ in all his splendor, and taught to reign with him world without
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are some here that I can hardly call the daughters of
          Jerusalem, yet they are always round about Zion's gate. Oh, there are
          many of you who are always listening to our voice, and joining in our
          hymns, and yet you have not seen our Master yet! Go forth; leave your
          sinful pleasures, and leave your self-righteousness too; go forth and
          behold King Solomon. Look to Jesus, sinner, bleeding on the cross, and
          as thou lookest, love and trust; and I know that as soon as thou hast
          seen him and trusted him, thou wilt have a crown to put upon his head.
          It will be the day of thine espousal unto him, and thou wilt crown him
          with such a crown. Thou wilt decorate that crown with jewels dug from
          the secret mine of thy deepest heart, and having made this crown, thou
          wilt put it on his head, and fall down before him and sing --
        </p>
        <p>|All hail the power of Jesu's name,</p>
        <p>Let angels prostrate fall;</p>
        <p>Bring forth the royal diadem,</p>
        <p>And crown him Lord of all.|</p>
        <p>
          Well, then, we will lay aside every fear, and continue all the day
          gazing upon our matchless Christ, adoring him, exalting him, and
          having fellowship with him; for all is well; his travelling chariot is
          always safe, and soon will he step out of it with his bride at his
          right hand, and the world shall be astonished to behold the beauties
          of the royal pair when he shall be exalted, and they that are with
          him, before the presence of his Father and all the holy angels!<br />
