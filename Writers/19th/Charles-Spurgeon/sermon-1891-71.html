          1. We have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than
          from those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did
          at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of
          God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar
          of our faith. For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before
          they possessed |perfect knowledge,| as some do even venture to say,
          boasting themselves as improvers of the apostles. For, after our Lord
          rose from the dead, [the apostles] were invested with power from on
          high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], were filled from all
          [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to the ends of
          the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from
          God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do
          all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also
          issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while
          Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of
          the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter
          of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached
          by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the
          Gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord,
          who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel
          during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.

          2. These have all declared to us that there is one God, Creator of
          heaven and earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one
          Christ the Son of God. If any one do not agree to these truths, he
          despises the companions of the Lord; nay more, he despises Christ
          Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, and stands
          self-condemned, resisting and opposing his own salvation, as is the
          case with all heretics.<br />
