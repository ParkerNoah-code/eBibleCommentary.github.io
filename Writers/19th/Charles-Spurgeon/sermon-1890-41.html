        <p>Taken from the Decretal of Gratian.</p>
        <p>I.</p>
        <p>
          That the man who refuses to be reconciled to his brother should be
          reduced by the severest fastings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any injured person refuses to be reconciled to his brother, when he
          who has injured him offers satisfaction, he should be reduced by the
          severest fastings, even until he accepts the satisfaction offered him
          with thankful mind.
        </p>
        <p>II.</p>
        <p>
          The man is rendered infamous who knowingly presumes to forswear
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whosoever has knowingly forsworn himself, should be put for forty days
          on bread and water, and do penance also for the seven following years;
          and he should never be without penance; and he should never be
          admitted to bear witness. After this, however, he may enjoy communion.
        </p>
        <p>III.</p>
        <p>A man and a woman subject to madness cannot enter into marriage.</p>
        <p>
          Neither can a mad man nor a mad woman enter into the marriage
          relation. But if it has been entered, then they shall not be
          separated.
        </p>
        <p>IV.</p>
        <p>
          Marriage relations in the fifth generation may unite with each other;
          and in the fourth generation, if they are found, they should not be
          separated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning relations who enter affinity by the connection of husband
          and wife, these, on the decease of wife or husband, may form a union
          in the fifth generation; and in the fourth, if they are found, they
          should not be separated. In the third degree of relationship, however,
          it is not lawful for one to take the wife of another on his death. In
          an equable manner, a man may be united in marriage after his wife's
          death with those who are his own kinswomen, and with the kinswomen of
          his wife.
        </p>
        <p>To the immediately preceding notice.</p>
        <p>
          Those who marry a wife allied by blood, and are separated, shall not
          be at liberty, as long as both parties are alive, to unite other wives
          with them in marriage, unless they can plead the excuse of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>V.</p>
        <p>
          Blood connections alone, or, if offspring entirely fails, the old and
          trustworthy, should reckon the matter of propinquity in the synod.
        </p>
        <p>
          No alien should accuse blood connections, or reckon the matter of
          consanguinity in the synod, but relations to whose knowledge it
          pertains, -- that is, father and mother, sister and brother, paternal
          uncle, maternal uncle, paternal aunt, maternal aunt, and their
          children. If, however, offspring entirely fails, the bishop shall make
          inquiry canonically of the older and more trustworthy persons to whom
          the same relationship may be known; and if such relationship is found,
          the parties should be separated.
        </p>
        <p>VI.</p>
        <p>Every one of the faithful should communicate three times a year.</p>
        <p>
          Although they may not do it more frequently, yet at least three times
          in the year should the laity communicate, unless one happen to be
          hindered by any more serious offences, -- to wit, at Easter, and
          Pentecost, and the Lord's Nativity.
        </p>
        <p>VII.</p>
        <p>
          A presbyter should not be ordained younger than thirty years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one has not completed thirty years of age, he should in no way be
          ordained as presbyter, even although he may be extremely worthy; for
          even the Lord Himself was baptized only when He was thirty years of
          age, and at that period He began to teach. It is not right, therefore,
          that one who is to be ordained should be consecrated until he has
          reached this legitimate age.
