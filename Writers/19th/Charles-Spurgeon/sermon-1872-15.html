          |For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
          confidence steadfast unto the end.| -- Hebrews 3:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOW IS IT POSSIBLE for the preacher to say too much about faith, or to
          extol this grace too highly! It is of vital importance, not at one
          stage of the Christian's history only, but throughout the whole of his
          career, from his setting out even till he reaches the goal where faith
          is turned to sight. By faith we begin the life of obedience to Christ,
          and by faith we continue to lead the life of holiness, for |the just
          shall live by faith.| This is the point of honor and of safety with
          all the just -- the justified ones. The whole compass of their
          well-being, though it take in the sternest sense of duty and the
          highest grant of privilege, is to believe simply, to rely implicitly,
          and to confide cheerfully, in their covenant God. The beginning of
          their confidence is a hopeful sign. Time will test its value. The
          result of that profession has yet to be shown. Hence it is necessary
          that the beginning of their confidence should be held fast, steadfast
          even unto the end. When we begin in the spirit we do not proceed with
          a hope to be made perfect in the flesh. We do not start with
          justification by faith, and then look for perfection by works. We do
          not lean upon Christ when we are little children, and then expect to
          run alone when we are men; but we live by drawing all our stores from
          him, while as yet we are naked, and poor, and miserable. When most
          enriched by his grace, we still have to say and delight to say it,
          |all my springs are in thee.| Faith at the beginning and faith at the
          close; faith all the way through is the one important matter. A
          failure in this, as we observed in our reading, shut Israel out of the
          promised land. |They could not enter in because of unbelief.| Unbelief
          is always the greatest mischief to the saints; hence they have need
          earnestly to watch against it. Faith is always the channel of
          innumerable blessings to them: they ought, therefore, most watchfully
          to maintain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall have to show the value of faith while we try to open up the
          text before us, in which I see, first, a high privilege: |we are made
          partakers of Christ;| and secondly, by implication, a serious question
          -- the question whether or no we have been made partakers of Christ
          and, then, in the third place, an unerring test. |We are made
          partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence
          steadfast unto the end.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, here is A VERY HIGH PRIVILEGE. |We are made partakers
          of Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe that the text does not say, |we are made partakers with
          Christ.| That would be true, a very precious truth too, for we are
          joint-heirs with Christ, and because all things are his, all things
          are ours. Christ holds for us the entire heritage of the faithful as
          our representative, and as we are made partakers with him in the
          Father's favor, and in the world's hatred, so we shall be partakers
          with him in the glory to be revealed, and in the bliss which endures
          for ever and ever. But here we have to do with our being partakers of
          Christ, rather than our being partakers with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither does it say we are made partakers of rich spiritual benefits.
          That is a fact which we may greet with thorough trust and hearty
          welcome. But, dear brethren, there is more than that here. To be
          partakers of pardoning mercy, to be partakers of renewing grace; to be
          partakers of the adoption, to be partakers of sanctification,
          preservation, and of all the other covenant blessings, is to possess
          an endowment of unspeakable value; but to be made |partakers of
          Christ,| is to have all in one. You have all the flowers in one posy,
          all the gems in one necklace, all the sweet spices in one delicious
          compound. |We are made partakers of Christ| -- of himself. |It pleased
          the Father that in him should all fullness dwell,| and we are made
          partakers with him of all that he is ordained to be of God unto us --
          |wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.| We are
          partakers of him; this is a privilege that no tongue can ever utter,
          no thought of finite mortal can ever grasp. But ah, it would need more
          time than we can afford, and far more spiritual teaching than we
          profess to have attained, to dive into this great and profound
          utterance, |We are made partakers of Christ.| Still, as we stand
          spell-bound on the margin, let us venture to sail out just a little
          upon the surface of this ocean of goodness and of grandeur.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are made partakers of Christ, beloved, when first of all by faith
          in him we-procure a share in his merits. Sinful and sad, covered with
          transgressions and conscious of our shame, we come to the fountain
          filled with his blood, we washed in it, and were made white as snow.
          In that hour we became partakers of Christ. Christ is the substitute
          for sin. He suffered the penalty due from the unjust, for whom he
          died, to the violated law of God. When we believe in him we become
          partakers of those sufferings, or rather of the blessed fruit of them.
          The fact of his having borne what we ought to have borne becomes
          available to us. We present the memorial thereof at the altar of God,
          the throne of the heavenly grace, in prayers and professions, and in
          spiritual worship. The blood pleads our cause. The blood of Jesus,
          which speaketh better things than that of Abel, intercedes for mercy,
          not for vengeance. By its rich virtue, its real value, its vital
          merit, it puts our sins for ever to death and lays our fears for ever
          to rest. Oh, how blessed to be a partaker of Christ, the sin-atoning
          sacrifice -- to stand before God as a sinner that deserves nothing but
          damnation in himself, and yet knows by precious faith, that
        </p>
        <p>|Covered is my unrighteousness,</p>
        <p>From condemnation I am free -- |</p>
        <p>
          -- that I am a partakerof the meritorious sacrifice of the great high
          Priest, who, having once offered one sacrifice for ever, now sits
          down, his work being done, at the right hand of God. What a privilege
          is this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, we are partakers of Christ, inasmuch as his righteousness
          also becomes ours by imputation. We are not only freed from sin
          through his atonement, but we are rendered acceptable to God through
          his obedience as our responsible surety. We are |accepted in the
          beloved,| we are justified through his righteousness. God seeth not us
          marred in the likeness of the first Adam who sinned, but he seeth us
          in Christ, the second Adam, remade, redeemed, restored, arrayed in
          garments of glory and beauty, with the Savior's vesture on, as holy as
          the Holy One. He seeth |no sin in Jacob nor iniquity in Israel.| When
          Jacob learns to trust in the Messiah, and Israel hides behind his
          representative, the Lord our Righteousness, Jacob ceases to wrestle,
          for he prevails, and Israel stands in honor, for he is a prince with
          God. Blessed, thrice blessed, are they who are partakers of Christ in
          his righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          After we are thus saved from sin, and righteousness is imputed to us
          by faith, we further become partakers of Christ by living upon him,
          feeding on him. The sacramental table represents our fellowship.
          Though it does no more than represent it, it represents it well. At
          that table we eat bread, and we drink wine, and the body is thus fed,
          typifying that through meditation upon the incarnate Christ our soul
          is sustained, and by remembering the passion of the Lord, as the wine
          cup sets forth his blood, our spirits are comforted and revived, and
          our hearts are nourished. It is not that the bread is anything or the
          wine anything, but it is that Christ is everything to us. He is our
          daily bread, his atonement makes glad our heart -- makes us |strong in
          the Lord and in the power of his might.| Brethren, you know what it is
          to feed upon Jesus, and what satisfying food it is! When nothing else
          can give your soul rest and peace, remembering the incarnate God will
          do it, a study of the suffering Savior will bring the refreshment and
          consolation you want. Jesus Christ when he is our food makes us to be
          partakers of himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, is there not a doctrine concealed here of deeper significance?
          The union of believers with himself was among the latest of all the
          revelations which our blessed Lord when on earth made known to his
          disciples. With a parable he showed it, and without a parable he
          declared it plainly. Every true child of God is one with Christ. This
          union is set forth in Scripture by several images, to which we will
          just refer, but upon none of which can we just now enlarge. We are one
          with Christ and partakers of him as the stone is cemented to the
          foundation. It is built upon it, rests upon it, and, together with the
          foundation, goes to make up the structure. So we are built into Christ
          by coherence and adhesion, joined to him, and made a spiritual house
          for the habitation of God by the Holy Ghost. We are made partakers
          with Christ by a union in which we lean and depend upon him. This
          union is further set forth by the vine and the branches. The branches
          are participators with the stem, the sap of the stem is for the
          branches. It treasures it up only to distribute it to them. It has no
          sap for itself alone, all its store of sap is for the branch. In like
          manner we are vitally one with Christ, and the grace that is in him is
          for us. It was given to him that he might distribute it to all his
          people. Furthermore, it is as the union of the husband with the wife,
          they are participators the one with the other. All that belongs to the
          husband the wife enjoys and shares with him. Meanwhile she shares
          himself, nay, he is all her own. Thus it is with Christ. We are
          married unto him -- betrothed unto him for ever in righteousness and
          in judgment, and all that he has is ours, and he himself is ours. All
          his heart belongs to each one of us. And then, too, as the members of
          the body are one with the head, as they derive their guidance, their
          happiness, their existence from the head, so are we made partakers of
          Christ. Oh, matchless participation! It is |a great mystery| saith the
          apostle; and, indeed, such a mystery it is as they only know who
          experience it. Even they cannot understand it fully; far less can they
          hope to set it forth so that carnal minds shall comprehend its
          spiritual meaning. The day cometh when we shall be partakers of Christ
          to the highest and uttermost degree that symbols can suggest, prophecy
          forestal, faith anticipate, or actual accomplishment bring to pass;
          for, albeit, though of all that our Lord Jesus Christ is in heaven we
          have a reversionary interest to-day by faith, we shall have a share in
          it by actual participation ere long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Partakers of Christ! Yes, and therefore with him partakers in destiny.
          When he shall come his holy ones shall come with him. That he has
          risen from the dead is the earnest of their resurrection. At the day
          of his appearing they shall rise and participate in the fruition of
          his mediatorial work. Then, in the judging of the world, in the
          destruction of all his spiritual foes, in the great marriage-day when
          the bride shall have made herself ready, and he shall drink of the new
          wine in the kingdom of his Father, and in all else that is to come,
          too glorious to be described except by symbols like those of the
          Apocalypse, his people shall participate with him, for this honor have
          all his saints. All right and all might, all that can extol or
          delight, all that for ever and for ever shall contribute to the glory
          of Christ, shall be shared by all the faithful, for we are partakers
          not only with him, but of him -- of Christ -- therefore of all the
          surroundings of glory and honor that shall belong to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language of the text reminds us that none of us have any title to
          this privilege by nature. |We are made partakers of Christ.| From our
          first parentage He derived a very different entail. We all of woman
          born became partakers of the ruin of the first Adam, of the corruption
          of humanity, of the condemnation common to the entire race. Oh, to be
          made partakers! This is a work of grace, of sovereign omnipotent grace
          -- a work which a man cannot sufficiently admire, and for which he can
          never be sufficiently grateful. |We are made partakers of Christ.|
          This is the Holy Ghost's work in us, to rend us away from the old wild
          olive, and to graft us into the good olive, -- to dissolve the union
          between us and sin, and to cement a union between our souls and
          Christ, -- to take us out of the Egyptian bondage and the Egyptian
          night in which we willingly sat, and to bring us into the liberty and
          the light wherewith Christ makes his people free and glad. This is
          work as grand and godlike as to create a world. For it let the Lord's
          name be magnified by each one of us if, indeed, we have been made
          partakers of Christ. If -- I say; and that |if| leads me to the second
          point I proposed to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The privilege of which we have spoken suggests A SOLEMN SEARCHING
          QUESTION. Are we made partakers of Christ? O beloved, many think they
          are who are not. There is nothing more to be dreaded than a
          supposititious righteousness, a counterfeit justification, a spurious
          hope. Better, I sometimes think, to have no religion than to have a
          false religion. I am quite certain that the man is much more likely to
          be saved who knows that he is naked, and poor, and miserable, than the
          man who says, |I am rich and increased in goods.| It were infinitely
          better to take the road to heaven doubting than to go in another
          direction presuming. I am far better pleased with the soul that is
          always questioning, |Am I right?| than with him who has drunk the cup
          of arrogance till he is intoxicated with selfconceit and says, |I know
          my lot; the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; there is no
          need for self-examination in my case.| Brethren, be assured of this;
          all men are not partakers of Christ: all baptised men are not
          partakers of Christ: all churchmen are not partakers of Christ: all
          dissenters are not made partakers of Christ: all members of this
          church are not made partakers of Christ: all ministers, all elders,
          all bishops, are not made partakers of Christ. Yea, all apostles were
          not made partakers of Christ. One of them, Christ's familiar friend,
          who kept the little purse which held all the Master's earthly store,
          lifted up his heel against him, betrayed him with a tender treacherous
          kiss, and became the son of perdition. He was a companion of Christ
          not a partaker of him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Am I made a partaker of Christ? Multiply the question till each
          individual among you makes it his own. In this congregation there are
          various classes. There are probably some here who are only hearers --
          hearers about Christ, not partakers of Christ. It is one thing to hear
          about a banquet, it is quite another thing to be fed at it. It is one
          thing in the wilderness to hear of rippling streams, and quite another
          to stoop down and drink the cooling draught -- one thing for the
          prisoner by night to dream of liberty, or by day to read of roaming
          free through his native country, another thing to get rid of the chain
          -- one thing to hear of pardon, another thing to be pardoned -- one
          thing to hear of heaven, another thing to go there. O my dear hearers!
          some of you are as familiar with the gospel as you are with the house
          you live in; yet, though you live in the house, you never live in the
          gospel, and I fear you never will. You hear it, and hear it, that is
          all. God grant you may not have to hear of your hearing in another
          world, where it shall be laid down among the chief of your sins that
          you were of those who, when they heard did provoke -- provoke because
          they rejected what they ought to have received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others go farther than hearing. They become professors. May I remind
          you -- and I would not judge anyone harshly -- certainly no man more
          harshly than I would myself -- it is one thing to profess to be a
          partaker of Christ, and another thing to be made a partaker of Christ.
          I may profess that I am rich and be all the while a bankrupt, a
          dishonest bankrupt for having made the profession. I may protest that
          I am in health, while a deadly cancer may lurk within. I may declare
          that I am honest, but it will not clear me before the judge if I am
          proved a thief. I may avow that I am loyal, but it would not save my
          life if I were convicted of high treason. Professions; ah, I fear they
          are in many cases but a painted pageantry that makes the road to hell
          attractive. Professions there are not unfrequently upon which we may
          gaze with a vacant wonder and turn away with a cold shudder, as from
          the sombre gaudiness of a funeral, wherein prancing steeds, stately
          mutes, nodding plumes, and velvet palls adorn the obsequies of the
          dead. God save us from a lifeless profession! May we never be like
          certain trees, of which Bunyan said, that they were green outside, but
          inwardly they were so rotten that they were only fit to be tinder for
          the devil's tinder-box. Many professors are too fair not to be false;
          too comely outside not to be loathsome within; for there is an
          over-doing of the sepulchre's whitewash. You feel convinced that there
          would not be so much whitewashing without if there were not a good
          deal of rottenness inside to be concealed. Essence of roses or of
          lavender is sweet, but much scent excites much suspicion. Oh, let us,
          each one who professes to-night, say to himself, |I was baptised on a
          profession of my faith, but was I ever baptised into Christ? When the
          Sacred name of the triune God was named on me, did I then enter into
          the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost? I have
          come often to the communion table; but have I communed with Christ
          there? My name is on the church-book, but is it written in heaven? I
          have said to others I am a Christian, but am I in very deed known unto
          Christ? Or will he say unto me in that day, I never knew you: depart
          from me ye workers of iniquity'?|
        </p>
        <p>
          These are solemn questionings. Many persons are temporary followers of
          Christ, and outwardly, as far as the human eye can follow, they appear
          to be real followers of Christ. I believe in the final perseverance of
          the saints; but I do not know, nor can any man know, how near a man
          may approach to the likeness of a saint and yet after all apostatise.
          Nor is any one of us able to say of himself, or of his fellow members,
          |We never shall fall away.| I remember one whose voice I, and many of
          your heard in prayer, and we enjoyed the exercise of his gifts. The
          man had been reclaimed from the lowest class of society, and he
          distinguished himself by his devotion in such a way that he was
          accepted as a church officer among us. I remember, when the first
          charge of sin was brought against him, and of very grievous sin, one
          among us said, |If that man is not a child of God I am not a child of
          God.| The expression seemed to me too strong, but in my heart I almost
          joined in it. I was ready to pronounce him innocent before I
          investigated the charges. I felt certain that there could not be in
          such a man as that the impurity laid at his door; yet it was there, it
          was all there, and worse than tongue can tell. He repented and though
          not received into the church because the profession of repentance did
          not seem to be all we could wish it to be, yet there was a turning
          aside from sin for awhile. But he went into it again, and he wallowed
          in it. He died in it. As far as we could any of us judge, he perished
          in it. He went from bad to worse. I feel I might say without
          uncharitableness this man carried his iniquity, as far as human
          judgment could track him. Therefore, without prejudice to the doctrine
          of the final perseverance of the saints, which I implicitly believe, I
          will not venture to say of any among you -- much less will I venture
          to say it of myself, that I am sure I am so made a partaker of Christ
          that I shall hold fast my confidence to the end. I hope so. I rest in
          Christ, trusting in him. The possibility is that I am deceiving
          myself; the possibility is that you may be self-deceivers. At any
          rate, it is so far a possibility that I would beseech you to have no
          confidence but such as the Holy Ghost gives you; to put no reliance as
          to the future anywhere but in the eternal arms; have no assurance but
          that assurance which is based upon the word of God and the witness of
          the Spirit within your soul. That can give you infallible assurance.
          Apart from that, I repeat it again, I will say neither of you nor of
          myself, that I can be sure with all the profession that is made, that
          you are partakers of Christ. Some go even farther than being temporary
          followers of Christ, and yet after all perish. They maintain a
          consistent profession before the eye of men throughout the whole of
          their lives, as vessels that navigate the whole of the sea and go down
          in the harbour. There are soldiers that have held out and fought
          valiantly up to the very moment of victory, and then have run away.
          And there are professors that have been unexceptional in their lives,
          whose character has been apparently without a blemish, and even those
          who knew them in private could not detect any serious flaw in their
          conduct; yet, for all that, there was a worm at the root; a fly in the
          pot of ointment; a failure as to the sincerity of their grace. They
          had not, after all, the true faith which hangs upon Christ, and they
          did not persevere in heart, though they appeared to persevere in life.
          The difference between the Christian and the professor is sometimes
          such as only God can discern. There is a path which the eagle's eye
          hath not seen, and the lion's whelp hath not traversed -- a path of
          life into which God can bring us, end of which it may be said that he
          knows all who are in it. But, there is a something like it, a way
          which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of
          death. There is a counterfeit of the true metal of grace so well
          manufactured, that only omniscience itself can tell which is the
          reprobate silver and which is the pure shekel of the sanctuary. Grave
          reason have we, then, for raising the question as to whether we are
          made partakers of Christ or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now we come to THE UNERRING TEST. Patience comes to the aid of
          faith here. Evidences accumulate till the issue is conclusive. |We are
          made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence
          steadfast unto the end.|
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage may be read in two ways, neither of which violates the
          literal meaning of the original, either of which may express to us the
          mind of the Spirit -- as we have it in our version, |the beginning of
          our confidence,| or, as I would rather translate it, |the foundation
          of our confidence,| the basis on which our confidence rests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take your choice. We will expound and vindicate both. That man is a
          partaker of Christ who holds fast they he had at first, having
          received it, not as an education, but as an intuition of his spirit
          life; not as an argument, but as an axiom he could not challenge, or
          rather as an oracle he received joyfully and bowed to submissively.
          The confidence which is based upon the true foundation, even Christ
          Jesus, is simple and clear as one's own consciousness. It asks no
          proof because it admits no doubt. In vain the sceptic comes to me now
          and says, |Sir, you are asleep, and dreaming.| I answer, |No, sir, I
          am speaking to these thousands, and they are listening to me.| Even
          so, when I first believed the Gospel story it was with a childlike
          feeling that it was so and I knew it. The man who is not a partaker of
          Christ hears the gospel, professes to believe it, and in some measure
          acts accordingly; but he perishes because this pure, unwavering faith
          does not abide in him. He has not the faith of God's elect which never
          can be destroyed. He has only a notion, a creed of his own making, and
          not a faith of the Spirit's giving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, what was the beginning of our confidence? Well, the
          beginning of my confidence was, |I am a sinner, Christ is a Savior;
          and I rest on him to save me.| Long before I began with Christ he had
          begun with me; but when I began with him it was, as the law writers
          say, |In formâ pauperis,| after the style of a wretched mendicant -- a
          pauper who had nothing of his own, and looked to Christ for
          everything. I know when I first cast my eye to his dear cross and
          rested in him, I had not any merit of my own, it was all demerit. I
          was not deserving, except that I felt I was hell-deserving: I had not
          even a shade of virtue that I could confide in. It was all over with
          me. I had come to an extremity. I could not have found a farthing's
          worth of goodness in myself if I had been melted down. I seemed to be
          all rottenness, a dunghill of corruption, nothing better, but
          something a great deal worse. I could truly join with Paul at that
          time, and say that my own righteousnesses were dung. A strong
          expression he used; but I do not suppose he felt it to be strong
          enough. He says, |I count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be
          found in him.| Well, that is how we began with Christ. We were nothing
          at all, and Jesus Christ was all in all. Now, brethren, we are not
          made partakers of Christ unless we hold this fast to the end. Have you
          got beyond that? Are you something creditable in your own estimation?
          I am afraid of you. Are you richer now in yourselves that you were
          then? I am afraid of you, brethren. Do you mind the place you used to
          stand in? you dared not lift your eyes, to heaven, but cried, |God be
          merciful to me a sinner.| How in Christ you have a far nobler place
          than that, for you are made to sit with him in the heavenly places.
          But, I ask you, apart from Christ, have you any different place from
          that of deep selfabasement? If you have, you have not held the
          beginning of your confidence fast even until now. Begin to suspect
          yourself. This is the position always to take |having nothing and yet
          possessing all things.|
        </p>
        <p>|I the chief of sinners am</p>
        <p>But Jesus died for me.|</p>
        <p>
          Such is the beginning of our confidence. Brethren, where else was the
          beginning of your confidence? May we not say of it that it was only
          and wholly, entirely and exclusively, in the blood and righteousness
          of the Lord Jesus Christ? In the beginning of your confidence you did
          not rely upon any ceremonies, nor upon priests, nor upon your Bible
          readings, nor upon your prayings, nor upon your feelings, nor your
          experiences, nor your orthodoxy, nor your knowledge of doctrine, nor
          upon your works, nor your preachings, your sanctifications or your
          mortifications. No, in the beginning of your confidence the one
          foundation was Jesus only. Nothing save Jesus would I know. Oh, if on
          that day, I had met with a man who had any trust in his own
          righteousness, I know I should have quarrelled with him. If he had
          told me that he hoped that Jesus Christ would help him to save himself
          I could have wept over him to think he should be such a fool. Why,
          Christ is all or nothing. He must save us from top to bottom, or we
          never shall be saved at all. If our foundation is partly on the rock
          of his finished work, and partly on the sand of our own unworthy
          doing, the whole house totters and it must come down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, brethren, is there any correspondence between the beginning of
          your confidence and your present look-out? Had you anything except
          Christ to depend upon in the hour you first believed? Is there ought
          now added to that one foundation that God has laid, or hath your trust
          been supplemented by any fresh conceit of your own? Are you faithless?
          God is faithful. With you, it may be yea and nay; with him it is yea
          and amen. Some of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt depended
          upon God. They saw that he had divided the Red Sea, and rained down
          the manna, and refreshed them with streams in the desert, and so they
          believed, but their faith did not hold out. While they could see
          miracles of mercy, they relied on God, with nothing else to rely on;
          but when they got into a little difficulty they did not hold fast the
          beginning of their confidence unto the end, for they began to lose
          faith in Moses, or to confide in a golden calf. So there are some that
          begin, in a time of weakness, calamity, or despondence, by saying, |I
          trust in Christ, as a sinner.| They get beyond that when they recover
          from their temporary depression. Then they qualify their confessions
          after their altered circumstances, and elect their religion after
          their own deliberate choice. But the God of Israel will not allow it.
          He will not have us put any trust but in his dear Son. We must be
          stripped naked of everything but that which Christ spins. We must have
          all our bread mouldy til we cast it out because we loathe it, and we
          must feed on nothing but the bread of heaven. If we get beyond that
          and feed on anything else, we are not made partakers of him, for we
          have not held fast the beginning of our confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me call back your thoughts again, beloved, to the love of your
          espousals, when you acknowledged the Lord and went after him into the
          wilderness. Did you not then have confidence in Christ of a very
          humble character? Oh, at that time you did not want to be among the
          first of God's people to play the part of Diotrephes. When you were at
          the foot of the cross, and looked up as a poor sinner, you had no
          notion about being a distinguished man in the church. I know it did
          not come into my head that day that I should be a leader in God's
          Israel. Ah no, if I might but sit in the corner of his house, or be a
          door keeper it had been enough for me. If, like the dog under the
          table, I might get a crumb of his mercy, were it but flavoured by his
          hand, because he had broken it off that is all I wanted. That is just
          how we ought always to live -- lowly, humbly, gentle, and
          broken-spirited, and ready to be anything, so that Christ may he
          glorified. It shows the risings of the old nature when we get to be
          such consequential people that if anybody should say a hard word, we
          wonder, or if anybody slanders us, instead of saying, |Ah, if he knew
          us he could say something a good deal worse,| we are in a high and
          mighty temper because our brilliant character is injured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verily, I think, that when I was first converted to God if the Lord
          had said, |I have taken you into my house| and I am going to make use
          of you, and you shall be a door-mat for the saints to wipe their feet
          on,| I should have said, |Ah, happy shall I be if I but take the filth
          off their blessed feet, for I love God's people; and may I minister to
          them in the slightest degree, it shall be my delight.| But when we get
          away from that position we are in danger. If we are made partakers of
          Christ, the proof will be in our continuing to be of a meek and lowly
          spirit -- willing to serve him in any capacity -- in our becoming like
          little children, for |except we become as little children, we shall in
          no wise enter the kingdom of heaven.| Little children we were in the
          beginning of our confidence; little children we must continue to be,
          or else we may gravely question whether we have been made partakers of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we were first made partakers of Christ, we received him very
          gratefully. How thankful we were for one look from Jesus' eye. Half a
          promise seemed precious in those days. The sermon, though it was
          uncouth perhaps, if full of Christ, fed us to the full. Now, alas, how
          many professors despise precious truth if it does not happen to be
          clothed in the most polished phrases; they run hither and thither
          where there is no food for them: not hungering and thirsting after
          righteousness as of yore, they admire the banquet spread out with all
          flowers and no fruit: they look after gaudy periods, where pure silver
          and polished sham do sparkle, though there be no food for the soul to
          feed on. Did they hold fast the beginning of their confidence they
          would prize the truth and love the truth, and account that if it were
          but the truth, it did not matter in what shape it came to them, so
          long as they could get hold of a promise, have a smile from Christ's
          face or enjoy one ray of the blessed Spirit's consolation in their
          souls. But now the starving beggars have become dainty epicures; those
          who once were glad enough to come and feast on broken crusts from the
          Master's table, become connoisseurs of their Master's food; their soul
          |loatheth this light bread,| though it is the bread of angels, and
          drops from the granaries of God. We should suspect ourselves, when we
          get into that squeamish condition. Such a proud captious state of
          heart does not evidence that we have been made partakers of Christ at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we first received our confidence, we were obedient in word and
          deed. I wish all disciples of Christ had the like scrupulous
          conscience. I speak my own experience. The first week after I was
          converted to God, I felt afraid to put one foot before another for
          fear I should do wrong; when I thought over the day if there had been
          a failure in my temper, or if there had been a frothy work spoken, or
          something done amiss, I did chasten myself sorely, and had I known at
          that time anything to be my Lord's will, I think I should not have
          hesitated to do it; to me it would not have mattered whether it was a
          fashionable thing or an unfashionable thing, if it was according to
          his word. Oh, to do his will! to follow him whithersoever he would
          have me go! Why, then it seemed as though I should never, never, never
          be slack in keeping his commandments. Dear brethren, have you held
          fast the beginning of your confidence? I smite upon my own breast when
          I remember that, in that respect, I have not held fast the beginning
          of my confidence. To the cross again! Beloved, if any of you have
          doubts aroused in your mind by such bitter reflections upon
          yourselves, do not dispute with your doubts; go to the cross again.
          Never dispute with the devil. He can always beat you. Go straight to
          the cross. If he says, |Thou art no saint,| say then |Very likely I am
          not, but there is one thing even thou canst not deny thou canst not
          say I am not a sinner; a sinner I am. Christ Jesus came into the world
          to save sinners and if I never trusted him before, I will begin now.
          If I never yet did know the life of God, I will look to his death
          forthwith. Oh, if I never was healed of the disease of sin, there is
          healing in those dear wounds, and I, by faith, will have it while yet
          it is called to-day.| Jesus, I trust thee; I trust thee wholly, and
          thee alone. I have heard that some years ago there was a coal-pit in
          work, the shaft of which by some means got blocked up, and the men
          could not get out of it. They were very nearly perishing. One of them
          had heard that there was an old working which led to another mine, and
          though he was afraid it might be blocked up, yet the best thing they
          could do would be to go along, if, perhaps, they might come to the
          mouth of another shaft. This old working had not been traversed for
          some time; it never was very lofty. They had to go along on their
          hands and knees, and generally needed to crawl lying flat on the
          ground. At length they came to the mouth of that old shaft, were soon
          extricated, and they gladly found their way to the upper air again.
          Peradventure, some of you have been living heretofore by frames and
          feelings; that experience has been the shaft by which you have been
          coming and going; and this shaft has been blocked up to-night. Well, I
          am not sorry for it. Come, now, brethren, let us all go along on our
          hands and knees where the sinners go. Let us crawl to the old shaft:
          let us prostrate ourselves, confessing, |Lord, I am vile, conceived in
          sin. Lord, I am unworthy: Lord, I am earthly, selfish, devilish. Lord,
          I am a mass of wounds and a mass of loathsomeness. I am unworthy of
          thy favor and thy love.| Let us just creep along in that fashion till
          we come to Christ, and say,
        </p>
        <p>|Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>Save that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bidst me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come.|</p>
        <p>
          You will find that old shaft is not shut up. There is light. Look up!
          There is the cross above you. Jesus is still willing to receive
          sinners, still able to save sinners, for he is |exalted| on high |to
          give repentance unto Israel and remission of sins.| O come to him just
          that way; and, brother, when you get back to Christ in that way by
          which you went years ago, the advice of the text, with which I will
          sum up all, is keep on coming to him in that same way always. Keep on
          coming always. Keep on coming always. Perhaps you have been on the top
          of a mountain such as the Rigi or as Snowden. You know these mountains
          do not move. They are good solid rock under your feet. But people
          erect platforms on the top of them to see the sun rise a little
          sooner, or something of that sort. From the top of one of those
          platforms a man may come down with a crash and break his limbs. That
          is something like our erections which we put up over our simple faith
          in Christ. Our beautiful frames and feelings and experiences -- they
          will come down with a crash some day, for they are rotten stuff; but,
          when a man stands upon this -- |Jesus Christ came into the world to
          save sinners, and I am resting upon him: he is all my salvation and
          all my desire: his precious blood is all my confidence. The love of
          his heart, the power of his arm, the merit of his plea, -- here I rest
          myself,| -- O beloved, there is no fear of that confidence ever giving
          way beneath your feet. There may you stand and serenely rejoice when
          worlds shall melt and the pillars of the earth shall reel. God bless
          you, and keep you ever holding the beginning of your confidence
          steadfast unto the end. So shall it be proved beyond question that you
          are partakers of Christ.
