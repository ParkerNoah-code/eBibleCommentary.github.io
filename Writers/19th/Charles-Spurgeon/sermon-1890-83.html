          Under the title of Fragments of the Second and Third Centuries are
          grouped together, in the Edinburgh series, a mass of valuable
          illustrative material, which might have been distributed with great
          advantage through the former volumes, in strict order of chronology.
          Something is due, however, to the unity of authorship, and to the
          marked design of the editors of the original edition to let these
          Fragments stand together, as the work of their accomplished
          collaborator, the Rev. B. P. Pratten, with whose skill and erudition
          our readers are already familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have contented myself, therefore, with giving approximate order and
          continuity, on chronological grounds, to the series of names
          subjoined. Bardesanes has been eliminated here, and placed more
          appropriately with the Syriac authors. The reader will find references
          which may aid him in seeking further information. Some of these names
          are of lasting value and interest in the Church. I prefer to call
          these |Fragments| their |Remains.|
        </p>
        <p>
          To each of the following names I have prefixed some details of
          information, with such dates as the learned supply.
        </p>
        <p>The following is the</p>
        <p>Translator's Introductory Notice</p>
        <p>
          The fragments that follow are the productions of writers who lived
          during the second century or the beginning of the third. Little is
          known of the writers, and the statements made in regard to them are
          often very indefinite, and the result of mere conjecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Quadratus was one of the first of the Christian apologists. He is
          said to have presented his apology to Hadrian while the emperor was in
          Athens attending the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Aristo of Pella, a Jew, was the author of a work called The
          Disputation of Jason and Papiscus. Nothing further is known of him. He
          flourished in the first half of the second century.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Melito was bishop of Sardis, and flourished in the reign of Marcus
          Aurelius. He wrote many works, but all of them have perished except a
          few fragments. The genuineness of the Syriac fragments is open to
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Hegesippus also flourished in the time of Antoninus Pius and Marcus
          Aurelius. He is the first ecclesiastical historian; but his book was
          rather notes for an ecclesiastical history, than a history.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Dionysius was bishop of Corinth in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He
          wrote letters to various churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Rhodon went from Asia to Rome, and became a pupil of Tatian. After
          the lapse of his master into heresy he remained true to the faith, and
          wrote against heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Maximus flourished about the same time as Rhodon, under the
          emperors Commodus and Severus.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Claudius Apollinaris was bishop of Hierapolis, and presented a
          defense of the Christians to Marcus Aurelius. He wrote many important
          works, of which we have only a few fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Polycrates was bishop of Ephesus. He took part in the controversy
          on the Passover question. He died about 200 a.d.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Theophilus was bishop of Cæsarea. He was a contemporary of
          Polycrates, and, like him, engaged in the Passover controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Serapion was ordained bishop of Antioch a.d.190, but almost no
          other fact of his life is known. He wrote several works.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. Apollonius wrote a work against the Montanists, probably in the
          year a.d.210. This is all that is known of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Pantænus, probably a Sicilian by birth, passed from Stoicism to
          Christianity, and went to Judæa to proclaim the truth. He returned to
          Alexandria, and became president of the catechetical school there, in
          which post he remained till his death, which took place about the year
          212 a.d.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. The Letter of the Churches in Vienne and Lyons was written shortly
          after the persecution in Gaul, which took place in a.d.177. It is not
          known who is the author. Some have supposed that Irenæus wrote it, but
          there is no historical testimony to this effect.
