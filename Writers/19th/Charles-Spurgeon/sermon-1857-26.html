        <p>A Sermon</p>

          |Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.| -- 1 Corinthians
          1:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNBELIEF toward the gospel of Christ is the most unreasonable thing in
          all the world, because the reason which the unbeliever gives for his
          unbelief is fairly met by the character and constitution of the gospel
          of Christ. Notice that before this verse we read -- |The Jews required
          a sign, the Greeks seek after wisdom.| If you met the Jew who believed
          not on Christ in the apostle's day, he said, |I can not believe,
          because I want a sign;| and if you met the Greek, he said, |I can not
          believe, because I want a philosophic system, one that is full of
          wisdom.| |Now,| says the apostle, |both these objections are untenable
          and unreasonable. If you suppose that the Jew requires a sign, that
          sign is given him: Christ is the power of God. The miracles that
          Christ wrought upon earth were signs more than sufficiently abundant;
          and if the Jewish people had but the will to believe, they would have
          found abundant signs and reasons for believing in the personal acts of
          Christ and his apostles.| And let the Greeks say, |I can not believe,
          because I require a wise system: O Greek, Christ is the wisdom of God.
          If thou wouldst but investigate the subject, thou wouldst find in it
          profoundness of wisdom -- a depth where the most gigantic intellect
          might be drowned. It is no shallow gospel, but a deep, and a great
          deep too, a deep which passeth understanding. Thine objection is
          ill-founded; for Christ is the wisdom of God, and his gospel is the
          highest of all sciences. If thou wishest to find wisdom, thou must
          find it in the word of revelation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this morning, we shall try to bring out these two thoughts of the
          gospel; and it may be that God shall bless what we shall say to the
          removing of the objection of either Jew or Greek; that the one
          requiring a sign may see it in the power of God in Christ, and that he
          who requireth wisdom may behold it in the wisdom of God in Christ. We
          shall understand our text in a threefold manner: Christ, that is,
          Christ personally, is |the power of God and the wisdom of God;|
          Christ, that is, Christ's gospel, is |the power of God and the wisdom
          of God;| Christ, that is, Christ in the heart -- true religion, is
          |the power of God and the wisdom of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, to begin, then, with CHRIST PERSONALLY. Christ considered as
          God and man, the Son of God equal with his Father, and yet the man,
          born of the Virgin Mary. Christ, in his complex person, is |the power
          of God and the wisdom of God.| He is the power of God from all
          eternity. |By his word were the heavens made, and all the host of
          them.| |The Word was God, and the Word was with God.| |All things were
          made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.|
          The pillars of the earth were placed in their everlasting sockets by
          the omnipotent right hand of Christ; the curtains of the heavens were
          drawn upon their rings of starry light by him who was from everlasting
          the All-glorious Son of God. The orbs that float aloft in ether, those
          ponderous planets, and those mighty stars, were placed in their
          positions or sent rolling through space by the eternal strength of him
          who is |the first and the last.| |the Prince of the kings of the
          earth.| Christ is the power of God, for he is the Creator of all
          things, and by him all things exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when he came to earth, took upon himself the fashion of a man,
          tabernacled in the inn, and slept in the manger, he still gave proof
          that he was the Son of God; not so much so when, as an infant of a
          span long, the immortal was the mortal and the infinite became a babe;
          not so much so in his youth, but afterward when he began his public
          ministry, he gave abundant proofs of his power and Godhead. The winds
          hushed by his finger uplifted, the waves calmed by his voice, so that
          they became solid as marble beneath his tread; the tempest, cowering
          at his feet, as before a conqueror whom it knew and obeyed; these
          things, these stormy elements, the wind, the tempest, and the water,
          gave full proof of his abundant power. The lame man leaping, the deaf
          man hearing, the dumb man singing, the dead rising, these, again, were
          proofs that he was, the |power of God.| When the voice of Jesus
          startled the shades of Hades, and rent the bonds of death, with
          |Lazarus, come forth!| and when the carcass rotten in the tomb woke up
          to life, there was proof of his divine power and Godhead. A thousand
          other proofs he afforded; but we need not stay to mention them to you
          who have Bibles in your houses, and who can read them every day. At
          last he yielded up his life, and was buried in the tomb. Not long,
          however, did he sleep; for he gave another proof of his divine power
          and Godhead, when starting from his slumber, he affrighted the guards
          with the majesty of his grandeur, not being holden by the bonds of
          death, they being like green withes before our conquering Samson, who
          had meanwhile pulled up the gates of hell, and carried them on his
          shoulders far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          That he is the power of God now, Scripture very positively affirmeth;
          for it is written, |he sitteth at the right hand of God.| He hath the
          reins of Providence gathered in his hands; the fleet coursers of Time
          are driven by him who sits in the chariot of the world, and bids its
          wheels run round; and he shall bid them stay when it shall please him.
          He is the great umpire of all disputes, the great Sovereign Head of
          the church, the Lord of heaven, and death, and hell; and by-and-by we
          shall know that he shall come,
        </p>
        <p>|On fiery clouds and wings of wind,</p>
        <p>Appointed Judge of all mankind;|</p>
        <p>
          and then the quickened dead, the startled myriads, the divided
          firmaments, the |Depart, ye cursed,| and the |Come, ye blessed,| shall
          proclaim him to be the power of God, who hath power over all flesh, to
          save or to condemn, as it pleaseth him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he is equally |the wisdom of God.| The great things that he did
          before all worlds were proofs of his wisdom. He planned the way of
          salvation; he devised the system of atonement and substitution; he
          laid the foundations of the great plan of salvation. There was wisdom.
          But he built the heavens by wisdom, and he laid the pillars of light,
          whereon the firmament is balanced, by his skill and wisdom. Mark the
          world; and learn, as ye see all its multitudinous proofs of the wisdom
          of God, and there you have the wisdom of Christ; for he was the
          creator of it. And when he became a man, he gave proofs enough of
          wisdom. Even in childhood, when he made the doctors sit abashed by the
          questions that he asked, he showed that he was more than mortal. And
          when the Pharisee and Sadducce and Herodian were all at last defeated,
          and their nets were broken, he proved again the superlative wisdom of
          the Son of God. And when those who came to take him, stood enchained
          by his eloquence, spell-bound by his marvelous oratory, there was
          again a proof that he was the wisdom of God, who could so enchain the
          minds of men. And now that he intercedeth before the throne of God,
          now that he is our Advocate before the throne, the pledge and surety
          for the blessed, now that the reins of government are in his hands,
          and are ever wisely directed, we have abundant proofs that the wisdom
          of God is in Christ, as well as the power of God. Bow before him, ye
          that love him; bow before him, ye that desire him! Crown him, crown
          him, crown him! He is worthy of it, unto him is everlasting might;
          unto him is unswerving wisdom: bless his name; exalt him; clap your
          wings, ye seraphs; cry aloud, ye cherubim; shout, shout, shout, to his
          praise, ye ransomed host above. And ye, O men that know his grace,
          extol him in your songs for ever; for he is Christ, the power of God
          and the wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now Christ, that is, CHRIST'S GOSPEL, is the power and the
          wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Christ's gospel is a thing of divine power. Do you want proofs of
          it? Ye shall not go far. How could Christ's gospel have been
          established in this world as it was, if it had not in itself intrinsic
          might? By whom was it spread? By mitered prelates, by learned doctors,
          by fierce warriors, by caliphs, by prophets? No; by fishermen,
          untaught, unlettered; save as the Spirit gave them utterance, not
          knowing how to preach or speak. How did they spread it? By the
          bayonet, by their swords, by the keen metal of their blades? Did they
          drive their gospel into men at the point of the lance, and with the
          cimeter? Say, did myriads rush to battle, as they did when they
          followed the crescent of Mohammed, and did they convert men by force,
          by law, by might? Ah I no. Nothing but their simple words, their
          unvarnished eloquence, their rough declamation, their unhewn oratory;
          these it was, which, by the blessing of God's Spirit, carried the
          gospel round the world within a century after the death of its
          founder.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what was this gospel which achieved so much? Was it a thing
          palatable to human nature? Did it offer a paradise of present
          happiness? Did it offer delight to the flesh and to the senses? Did it
          give charming prospects of wealth? Did it give licentious ideas to
          men? No; it was a gospel of morality most strict, it was a gospel with
          delights entirely spiritual -- a gospel which abjured the flesh,
          which, unlike the coarse delusion of Joe Smith, cut off every prospect
          from men of delighting themselves with the joys of lust. It was a
          gospel holy, spotless, clean as the breath of heaven; it was pure as
          the wing of angel; not like that which spread of old, in the days of
          Mohammed, a gospel of lust, of vice, and wickedness, but pure, and
          consequently not palatable to human nature. And yet it spread. Why? My
          friends, I think the only answer I can give you is, because it has in
          it the power of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But do you want another proof? How has it been maintained since then?
          No easy path has the gospel had. The good bark of the church has had
          to plow her way through seas of blood, and those who have manned her
          have been bespattered with the bloody spray; yea, they have had to man
          her and keep her in motion, by laying down their lives unto the death.
          Mark the bitter persecution of the church of Christ from the time of
          Nero to the days of Mary, and further on, through the days of Charles
          the Second, and of those kings of unhappy memory, who had not as yet
          learned how to spell |toleration.| From the dragoons of Claverhouse,
          right straight away to the gladiatorial shows of Rome, what a long
          series of persecutions has the gospel had! But, as the old divines
          used to say, |The blood of the martyrs| has been |the seed of the
          church.| It has been, as the old herbalists had it, like the herb
          camomile, the more it is trodden on, the more it grows; and the more
          the church has been ill-treated, the more it has prospered. Behold the
          mountains where the Albigenses walk in their white garments; see the
          stakes of smithfleld, not yet forgotten; behold ye the fields among
          the towering hills, where brave hands kept themselves free from
          despotic tyranny. Mark ye the Pilgrim Fathers, driven by a government
          of persecution across the briny deep. See what vitality the gospel
          has. Plunge her under the wave, and she rises, the purer for her
          washing; thrust her in the fire, and she comes out, the more bright
          for her burning; cut her in sunder, and each piece shall make another
          church; behead her, and like the hydra of old, she shall have a
          hundred heads for every one you cut away. She can not die, she must
          live; for she has the power of God within her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you want another proof? I give you a better one than the last. I do
          not wonder that the church has outlived persecution so much as I
          wonder she has outlived the unfaithfulness of her professed teachers.
          Never was church so abused as the church of Christ has been, all
          through her history; from the days of Diotrephes, who sought to have
          the pre-eminence, even to these later times, we can read of proud,
          arrogant prelates, and supercilious, haughty lords over God's
          inheritance. Bonners, Dunstans, and men of all sorts, have come into
          her ranks, and done all they could to kill her; and with their lordly
          priestcraft they have tried to turn her aside. And what shall we say
          to that huge apostacy of Rome? A thousand miracles that ever the
          church outlived that! When her pretended head became apostate, and all
          her bishops disciples of hell, and she had gone far away, wonder of
          wonders, that she should come out, in the days of the glorious
          Reformation, and should still live. And, even now, when I mark the
          supineness of many of my brethren in the ministry-when I mark their
          utter and entire inefficiency of doing aught for God -- when I see
          their waste of time, preaching now and then on the Sunday, instead of
          going to the highways and hedges and preaching the gospel everywhere
          to the poor -- when I see the want of unction in the church itself,
          the want of prayerfulness -- when I see wars and fightings, factions
          and disunions -- when I see hot blood and pride, even in the meetings
          of the saints; I say it is a thousand thousand miracles that the
          church of God should be alive at all, after the unfaithfulness of her
          members, her ministers, and her bishops. She has the power of God
          within her, or else she would have been destroyed; for she has got
          enough within her own loins to work her destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          |But,| says one, |you have not yet proved it is the power of God to my
          understanding.| Sir, I will give you another proof There are not a few
          of you, who are now present, who would be ready, I know, if it were
          necessary, to rise in your seats and bear me witness that I speak the
          truth. There are some who, not many months ago, were drunkards; some
          who were loose livers; men who were unfaithful to every vow which
          should keep man to truth, and right, and chastity, and honesty, and
          integrity. Yes, I repeat, I have some here who look back to a life of
          detestable sin. You tell me, some of you, that for thirty years even
          (there is one such present now) you never listened to a gospel
          ministry, nor ever entered the house of God at all; you despised the
          Sabbath, you spent it in all kinds of evil pleasures, you plunged
          headlong into sin and vice, and your only wonder is, that God has not
          out you off long ago, as cumberers of the ground; and now you are
          here, as different as light from darkness. I know your characters, and
          have watched you with a father's love; for, child though I am, I am
          the spiritual father of some here whose years outcount mine by four
          times the number; and I have seen you honest who were thieves, and you
          sober who were drunkards. I have seen the wife's glad eye sparkling
          with happiness; and many a woman has grasped me by the hand, shed her
          tears upon me, and said, |I bless God; I am a happy woman now; my
          husband is reclaimed, my house is blessed; our children are brought up
          in the fear of the Lord.| Not one or two, but scores of such are here.
          And, my friends, if these be not proofs that the gospel is the power
          of God, I say there is no proof of any thing to be had in the world,
          and every thing must be conjecture. Yes, and there worships with you
          this day (and if there be a secularist here, my friend will pardon me
          for alluding to him for a moment), there is in the house of God this
          day one who was a leader in your ranks, one who despised God, and ran
          very far away from right. And here he is! It is his honor this day to
          own himself a Christian; and I hope, when this sermon is ended, to
          grasp him by the hand, for he has done a valiant deed; he has bravely
          burned his papers in the sight of all the people, and has turned to
          God with full purpose of heart. I could give you proofs enough, if
          proofs were wanted, that the gospel has been to men the power of God
          and the wisdom of God. More proofs I could give, yea, thousands, one
          upon the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must notice the other points. Christ's gospel is the wisdom of
          God. Look at the gospel itself and you will see it to be wisdom. The
          man who scoffs and sneers at the gospel does so for no other reason
          but because he does not understand it. We have two of the richest
          books of theology extant that were written by professed infidels -- by
          men that were so, I mean, before they wrote the books. You may have
          heard the story of Lord Lyttleton and West. I believe they determined
          to refute Christianity; one of them took up the subject of Paul's
          conversion, and the other, the subject of the resurrection; they sat
          down, both of them, to write books to ridicule those two events, and
          the effect was, that in studying the subject, they, both of them,
          became Christians, and wrote books which are now bulwarks to the
          church they hoped to have overthrown. Every man who looks the gospel
          fairly in the face, and gives it the study it ought to have, will
          discover that it is no false gospel, but a gospel that is replete with
          wisdom, and full of the knowledge of Christ. If any man will cavil at
          the Bible, be must cavil. There are some men who can find no wisdom
          anywhere, except in their own heads. Such men, however, are no judges
          of wisdom. We should not set a mouse to explain the phenomena of
          astronomy, nor should we set a man who is so foolish as to do nothing
          but cavil to understand the wisdom of the gospel. It needs that a man
          should at least be honest, and have some share of sense, or we can not
          dispute with him at all. Christ's gospel, to any man who believes it,
          is the wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me just to hint that to be a believer in the gospel is no
          dishonor to a man's intellect. While the gospel can be understood by
          the poorest and the most illiterate, while there are shallows in it
          where a lamb may wade, there are depths where leviathan may swim. The
          intellect of Locke found ample space in the gospel; the mind of Newton
          submitted to receive the truth of inspiration as a little child, and
          found a something in its majestic being higher than itself, unto which
          it could not attain. The rudest and most untaught have been enabled,
          by the study of the holy Scripture of God's truth to enter the
          kingdom; and the most erudite have said of the gospel, it surpasses
          thought. I was thinking the other day what a vast amount of literature
          must be lost if the gospel be not true. No book was ever so suggestive
          as the Bible. Large tomes we have in our libraries which it takes all
          our strength to lift, all upon holy Scripture; myriads upon myriads of
          smaller volumes, tens of thousands of every shape and size, all
          written upon the Bible; and I have thought that the very
          suggestiveness of Scripture, the supernatural suggestiveness of holy
          Writ, may be in itself a proof of its divine wisdom, since no man has
          ever been able to write a book which could have so many commentators
          and so many writers upon its text as the Bible has received, by so
          much as one millionth part.

          III. CHRIST IN A MAN THE GOSPEL IN THE SOUL, is the power of God and
          the wisdom of God. We will picture the Christian from his beginning to
          his end. We will give a short map of his history. He begins there, in
          that prison-house, with huge iron bars, which he can not file; in that
          dark, damp cell, where pestilence and death are bred. There, in
          poverty and nakedness, without a pitcher to put to his thirsty lips,
          without a mouthful even of dry crust to satisfy his hunger, that is
          where be begins -- in the prison chamber of conviction, powerless,
          lost and ruined. Between the bars I thrust my hand to him, and give to
          him in God's name the name of Christ to plead. Look at him; he has
          been filing away at these bars many and many a day, without their
          yielding an inch; but now he has got the name of Christ upon his lips;
          he puts his hands upon the bars, and one of them is gone, and another,
          and another; and be makes a happy escape, crying, |I am free, I am
          free, I am free! Christ has been the power of God to me, in bringing
          me out of my trouble.| No sooner is he free, however, than a thousand
          doubts meet him. This one cries, |You are not elect;| another cries,
          |You are not redeemed;| another says, |You are not called;| another
          says, |You are not converted.| |Avaunt,| says he, |avaunt! Christ
          died;| and he just pleads the name of Christ as the power of God, and
          the doubts flee apace, and he walks straight on. He comes soon into
          the furnace of trouble; he is thrust into the innermost prison, and
          his feet are made fast in the stocks. God has put his hand upon him.
          He is in deep trouble; at midnight he begins to sing of Christ; and
          lo! the walls begin to totter, and the foundation of the prison to
          shake; and the man's chains are taken off, and he comes out free; for
          Christ hath delivered him from trouble. Here is a hill to climb, on
          the road to heaven. Wearily he pants up the side of that hill, and
          thinks he must die ere he can reach the summit. The name of Jesus is
          whispered in his ear; he leaps to his feet, and pursues his way, with
          fresh courage, until the summit is gained, when he cries, |Jesus
          Christ is the strength of my song; he also hath become my salvation.|
          See him again. He is on a sudden beset by many enemies; how shall he
          resist them? With this true sword, this true Jerusalem blade, Christ,
          and him crucified. With this he keeps the devil at arm's length; with
          this he fights against temptation, and against lust, against spiritual
          wickedness in high places, and with this he resists. Now, he has come
          to his last struggle; the river Death rolls black and sullen before
          him; dark shapes rise upward from the flood, and howl and fright him.
          How shall he cross the stream? How shall he find a landing place on
          the other side? Dread thoughts perplex him for a moment; he is
          alarmed; but he remembers, Jesus died; and catching up that watchword
          he ventures to the flood. Before his feet the Jordan flies apace; like
          Israel of old, he walks through, dry shod, singing as he goes to
          heaven, |Christ is with me, Christ is with me, passing through the
          stream ! Victory, victory, victory, to him that loveth me!|
        </p>
        <p>
          To the Christian in his own experience Christ is ever the power of
          God. As for temptation he can meet that with Christ; as for trouble he
          can endure that through Christ who strengthens him, yea, he can say
          with Paul, |I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.|
          Have you never seen a Christian in trouble, a true Christian? I have
          read a story of a man who was converted to God by seeing the conduct
          of his wife in the hour of trouble. They had a lovely child, their
          only offspring. The father's heart doted on it perpetually, and the
          mother's soul was knit up in the heart of the little one. It lay sick
          upon its bed, and the parents watched it night and day. At last it
          died. The father had no God: he rent his hair, he rolled upon the
          floor in misery, wallowed upon the earth, cursing his being, and
          defying God in the utter casting down of his agony. There sat his
          wife, as fond of the child as ever he could be; and though tears would
          come, she gently said |The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
          blessed be the name of the Lord.| |What,| said he, starting to his
          feet, |you love that child? I thought that when that child died you
          would break your heart. Here am I, a strong man. I am mad: here are
          you, a weak woman, and yet you are strong and bold; tell me what it is
          possesses you?| Said she, |Christ is my Lord, I trust in him; surely I
          can give this child to him who gave himself for me.| From that instant
          the man became a believer. |There must,| said he, |be some truth and
          some power in the gospel, which could lead you to believe in such a
          manner, under such a trial.| Christians! try to exhibit that spirit
          wherever you are, and prove to the worldling that in your experience
          at least |Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now the last point. In the Christian's experience, Christ is
          wisdom, as well as power. If you want to be a thoroughly learned man
          the best place to begin, is to begin at the Bible, to begin at Christ.
          It is said that even children learn to read more quickly from the
          Bible than from any other book; and this I am sure of, that we, who
          are but grown-up children, will learn better and learn faster by
          beginning with Christ than we could by beginning with any thing else.
          I remember saying once, and as I can not say it better I will repeat
          it, that before I knew the gospel I gathered up a heterogeneous mass
          of all kinds of knowledge from here, there, and everywhere; a bit of
          chemistry, a bit of botany, a bit of astronomy, and a bit of this,
          that, and the other. I put them altogether, in one great confused
          chaos. When I learned the gospel, I got a shelf in my head to put
          every thing away upon just where it should be. It seemed to me as if,
          when I had discovered Christ and him crucified, I had got the center
          of the system, so that I could see every other science revolving
          around in order. From the earth, you know, the planets appear to move
          in a very irregular manner -- they are progressive, retro grade,
          stationary; but if you could get upon the sun, you would see them
          marching round in their constant, uniform, circular motion. So with
          knowledge. Begin with any other science you like, and truth will seem
          to be awry. Begin with the science of Christ crucified, and you will
          begin with the sun, you will see every other science moving round it
          in complete harmony. The greatest mind in the world will be evolved by
          beginning at the right end. The old saying is, |Go from nature up to
          nature's God;| but it is hard work going up hill. The best thing is to
          go from nature's God down to nature; and if you once get to nature's
          God, and believe him and love him, it is surprising how easy it is to
          hear music in the waves, and songs in the wild whisperings of the
          winds; to see God everywhere, in the stones, in the rocks, in the
          rippling brooks, and hear him everywhere, in the lowing of cattle, in
          the rolling of thunder, and in the fury of tempests. Get Christ first,
          put him in the right place, and you will find him to be the wisdom of
          God in your own experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But wisdom is not knowledge; and we must not confound the two. Wisdom
          is the right use of knowledge; and Christ's gospel helps us, by
          teaching us the right use of knowledge. It directs us. Yon Christian
          has lost his way in a dark wood; but God's Word is a compass to him,
          and a lantern, too: he finds his way by Christ. He comes to a turn in
          the road. Which is right, and which is wrong? He can not tell. Christ
          is the great sign-post, telling him which way to go. He sees every day
          new straits attend; he knows not which way to steer. Christ is the
          great pilot who puts his hand on the tiller, and makes him wise to
          steer through the shoals of temptation and the rocks of sin. Get the
          gospel, and you are a wise man. |The fear of the Lord is the beginning
          of wisdom, and right understanding have they who keep his
          commandments.| Ah! Christian, you have had many doubts, but you have
          had them all unriddled, when you have come to the cross of Christ. You
          have had many difficulties; but they have been all explained in the
          light of Calvary. You have seen mysteries, when you have brought them
          to the face of Christ, made clear and manifest, which once you never
          could have known. Allow me to remark here, that some people make use
          of Christ's gospel to illuminate their heads, instead of making use of
          it to illuminate their hearts. They are like the farmer Rowland Hill
          once described. The farmer is sitting, by the fire with his children;
          the cat is purring on the hearth, and they are all in great comfort.
          The plowman rushes in and cries, |Thieves! thieves! thieves!| The
          farmer rises up in a moment, grasps the candle, holds it up to his
          head, rushes after the thieves, and, says Rowland Hill, |he tumbles
          over a wheelbarrow, because he holds the light to his head, instead of
          holding it to his feet.| So there are many who just hold religion up
          to illuminate their intellect, instead of holding it down to
          illuminate their practice; and so they make a sad tumble of it, and
          cast themselves into the mire, and do more hurt to their Christian
          profession in one hour than they will ever be able to retrieve. Take
          care that you make the wisdom of God, by God's Holy Spirit, a thing of
          true wisdom, directing your feet into his statutes, and keeping you in
          his ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now a practical appeal, and we have done. I have been putting my
          arrow on the string; and if I have used any light similes, I have but
          done so just as the archer tips his arrow with a feather, to make it
          fly the better. I know that a rough quaint saying often sticks, when
          another thing is entirely for-gotten. Now let us draw the bow, and
          send the arrow right at your hearts. Men, brethren, fathers, how many
          of you have felt in yourselves that Christ is the power of God, and
          the wisdom of God? Internal evidence is the best evidence in the world
          for the truth of the gospel. No Paley or Butler can prove the truth of
          the gospel so well as Mary, the servant girl yonder, that has got the
          gospel in her heart, and the power of it manifest in her life. Say,
          has Christ ever broken your bonds and set you free? Has he delivered
          you from your evil life, and from your sin? Has he given you |a good
          hope through grace,| and can you now say, |On him I lean; on my
          beloved I stay myself?| If so, go away and rejoice: you are a saint;
          for the apostle has said, |He is unto us who are saved, Christ the
          power of God and the wisdom of God.| But if you can not say this,
          allow me affectionately to warn you. If you want not this power of
          Christ, and this wisdom of Christ now, you will want them in a few
          short moments, when God shall come to judge the quick and the dead,
          when you shall stand before his bar, and when all the deeds that you
          have done shall be read before an assembled world. You will want
          religion then. O that you had grace to tremble now; grace to |kiss the
          Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is
          kindled but a little.| Hear ye how to be saved, and I have done. Do
          you feel that you are a sinner? Are you conscious that you have
          rebelled against God? Are you willing to acknowledge your
          transgressions, and do you hate and abhor them, while at the same time
          you feel you can do nothing to atone for them? Then hear this. Christ
          died for you; and if he died for you, you can not be lost. Christ died
          in vain for no man for whom he died. If you are a penitent and a
          believer, he died for you, and you are safe; go your way: rejoice
          |with joy unspeakable, and full of glory;| for he who has taught you
          your need of a Saviour, will give you that Saviour's blood to be
          applied to your conscience, and you shall ere long, with yonder
          blood-washed host, praise God and the Lamb saying, |Hallelujah, for
          ever, Amen!| Only do you feel that you are a sinner? If not, I have no
          gospel to preach to you; I can but warn you. But if you feel your lost
          estate, and come to Christ, come, and welcome, for he will never cast
          you away.<br />
