          1. If, again, they declare that these things [below] are a shadow of
          those [above], as some of them are bold enough to maintain, so that in
          this respect they are images, then it will be necessary for them to
          allow that those things which are above are possessed of bodies. For
          those bodies which are above do cast a shadow, but spiritual
          substances do not, since they can in no degree darken others. If,
          however, we also grant them this point (though it is, in fact, an
          impossibility), that there is a shadow belonging to those essences
          which are spiritual and lucent, into which they declare their Mother
          descended; yet, since those things [which are above] are eternal, and
          that shadow which is cast by them endures for ever, [it follows that]
          these things [below] are also not transitory, but endure along with
          those which cast their shadow over them. If, on the other hand, these
          things [below] are transitory, it is a necessary consequence that
          those [above] also, of which these are the shadow, pass away; while;
          if they endure, their shadow likewise endures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If, however, they maintain that the shadow spoken of does not exist
          as being produced by the shade of [those above], but simply in this
          respect, that [the things below] are far separated from those [above],
          they will then charge the light of their Father with weakness and
          insufficiency, as if it cannot extend so far as these things, but
          fails to fill that which is empty, and to dispel the shadow, and that
          when no one is offering any hindrance. For, according to them, the
          light of their Father will be changed into darkness and buried in
          obscurity, and will come to an end in those places which are
          characterized by emptiness, since it cannot penetrate and fill all
          things. Let them then no longer declare that their Bythus is the
          fulness of all things, if indeed he has neither filled nor illuminated
          that which is vacuum and shadow; or, on the other hand, let them cease
          talking of vacuum and shadow, if the light of their Father does in
          truth fill all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Beyond the primary Father, then -- that is, the God who is over all
          -- there can neither be any Pleroma into which they declare the
          Enthymesis of that Æon who suffered passion, descended (so that the
          Pleroma itself, or the primary God, should not be limited and
          circumscribed by that which is beyond, and should, in fact, be
          contained by it); nor can vacuum or shadow have any existence, since
          the Father exists beforehand, so that His light cannot fail, and find
          end in a vacuum. It is, moreover, irrational and impious to conceive
          of a place in which He who is, according to them, Propator, and
          Proarche, and Father of all, and of this Pleroma, ceases and has an
          end. Nor, again, is it allowable, for the reasons already stated, to
          allege that some other being formed so vast a creation in the bosom of
          the Father, either with or without His consent. For it is equally
          impious and infatuated to affirm that so great a creation was formed
          by angels, or by some particular production ignorant of the true God
          in that territory which is His own. Nor is it possible that those
          things which are earthly and material could have been formed within
          their Pleroma, since that is wholly spiritual. And further, it is not
          even possible that those things which belong to a multiform creation,
          and have been formed with mutually opposite qualities [could have been
          created] after the image of the things above, since these (i.e., the
          Æons) are said to be few, and of a like formation, and homogeneous.
          Their talk, too, about the shadow of kenoma -- that is, of a vacuum --
          has in all points turned out false. Their figment, then, [in what way
          soever viewed,] has been proved groundless, and their doctrines
          untenable. Empty, too, are those who listen to them, and are verily
          descending into the abyss of perdition.<br />
