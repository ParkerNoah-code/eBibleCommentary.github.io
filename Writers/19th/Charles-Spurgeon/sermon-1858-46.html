        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.210)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 22, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>|As thy days, so shall thy strength be;| -- Deuteronomy 33:25.</p>
        <p>
          BELOVED, IT SEEMS A SAD THING that every day must die and be followed
          by a night. When we have seen the hills clad with verdure to their
          summit, and the seas laving their base with a silver glory; when we
          have stretched our eye faraway, and have seen the widening prospect
          full of loveliness and beauty we have felt sad that the sunlight
          should ever set upon such a scene, and that so much beauty should be
          shrouded in the oblivion of darkness. But how much reason have we to
          bless God for nights! for if it were not for nights how much of beauty
          never would be discovered. Never should I have considered the heavens
          the work of thy fingers, O my God, if thou hadst not first covered the
          sun with a thick mantle of darkness: the moon and the stars, which
          thou hast ordained, had never been bright in mine eyes, if thou hadst
          not hidden the light of the sun and bidden him retire within the
          curtains of the west. Night seems to be the great friend of the stars:
          they must be all unseen by eyes of men, were they not set in the foil
          of darkness. It is even so with winter. We might feel sad, that all
          the flowers of summer must die, and all the fruits of autumn must be
          gathered into their store-house, that every tree must be stripped. and
          that all the fields must lose their fair flowers. But were it not for
          winter we should never see the glistening crystals of the snow; we
          should never behold the beauteous festoons of the icicles that hang
          from the eaves. Much of God's marvellous miracles of hoar frost must
          have been hidden from us, if it had not been for the cold chill of
          winter, which, when it robs us of one beauty, gives us another, --
          when it takes away the emerald of verdure, it gives us the diamond of
          ice -- when it casts from us the bright rubies of the flowers, it
          gives us the fair white ermine of snow. Well now, translate those two
          ideas, and you will see why it is that even our sin, our lost and
          ruined estate, has been made the means, in the hand of God, of
          manifesting to us the excellencies of his character. My dear friends,
          if you and I had been without trouble, we never could have had such a
          promise as this given to us: -- |As thy days, so shall thy strength
          be.| It is our weakness that has made room for God to give us such a
          promise as this. Our sins make room for a Saviour; our frailties make
          room for the Holy Spirit to correct them; all our wanderings make room
          for the good Shepherd, that he may seek us and bring us back. We do
          not love nights, but we do love stars; we do not love weakness, but we
          do bless God for the promise that is to sustain us in our weakness, we
          do not admire winter, but we do admire the glittering snow; we must
          shudder at our own trembling weakness, but we still do bless God that
          we are weak because it makes room for the display of his own
          invincible strength in fulfilling such a promise as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addressing you this morning, I shall first have to notice the
          self-weakness which is implied in our text; secondly, I shall come to
          the great promise of the text; and then I shall try and draw one or
          two inferences from it, ere I conclude.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, the SELF-WEAKNESS HINTED AT IN THE TEXT. To keep to my
          figure, if this promise be like a star, you know there is no seeing
          the stars in the daytime when we stand here upon the upper land; we
          must go down a deep well, and then we shall be able to discover them.
          Now, beloved, as this is day-time with our hearts, it will be
          necessary for us to go down the deep well of old recollections of our
          past trials and troubles. We must first get a good fair idea of the
          great depth of our own weakness, before we shall be able to behold the
          brightness of this rich and exceeding precious promise. A
          self-sufficient man can no more understand this promise, than a coal
          heaver can understand Greek: he has never been in a position in which
          to understand it; he has never learned his own need of another's
          strength, and therefore he cannot possibly understand the value of a
          promise which consists in giving to us a strength beyond our own. Let
          us for a few minutes consider our own weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ye children of God, have ye not proved your own weakness in the day of
          duty? The Lord has spoken to you, and he has said, |Son of man, run,
          and do such and such a thing which I bid thee;| and you have gone to
          do it, but as you have been upon your way, a sense of great
          responsibility has bowed you down, and you have been ready to turn
          back even at the outset, and to cry, |Send by whomsoever thou wilt
          send, but not by me.| Reinforced by strength, you have gone to the
          duty, but while performing it, you have at times felt your hands
          hanging exceeding heavy, and you have had to look up many a time and
          cry, |O Lord, give me more strength, for without thy strength this
          work must be unaccomplished, I cannot perform it myself.| And when the
          work has been done, and you have looked back upon it you have either
          been filled with amazement that it should have been done at all by so
          poor and weak a worm as yourself, or else you have been overcome with
          horror because you have been afraid the work was marred, like the
          vessel on the potter's wheel, by reason of your own want of
          skilfulness. I confess in my own position, I have a thousand causes to
          confess my own weakness every day. In preparing for the pulpit how
          often do we discover our weakness when a hundred texts exhibit
          themselves, and we know not which to choose, and when we have selected
          our subject, distracting thoughts come in, and when we would
          concentrate our minds upon some holy topic, we find they are carried
          hither and thither, driven about like the minds of children by every
          wind of thought. And when we bow our knees to seek the Lord's help
          before we preach how often does our tongue refuse to give utterance to
          the earnestness of our hearts. And alas! how frequently too is our
          heart cold when we are about to enter upon an occupation which
          requires the heart to be hot like a furnace, and the lip to be burning
          like a live coal. Here in this pulpit I have often learned my
          weakness, when words have fled from me, and thoughts have departed
          too; and when that seal which I thought would have poured itself forth
          like a cataract, has trickled forth in unwilling drops like a sullen
          stream, the source of which doth almost fail, and which seemeth itself
          as if it longed to be dried up and dead. And after preaching, how have
          I cast myself upon my bed, and tossed to and fro, groaning because I
          thought I had failed to deliver my message, and had not preached my
          Master's Word as my Master would have me preach it. All of you, in
          your own callings I dare say, have had enough to prove that. I do not
          believe a Christian man can examine himself without finding every day
          that weakness is proven even in the doing of his duty. Your shop,
          however small, will be enough to prove to you your weakness, your
          business, however little, your cares, however light, your family, how
          ever small, will furnish you with enough proofs of the fact: |Without
          me ye can do nothing;| |He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same
          bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, we prove our weakness, perhaps more visibly, when we
          come into the day of suffering. There it is that we are weak indeed. I
          have sat by the side of those who have been exceedingly sick, and have
          marked their patience; but I do not know that I ever wondered at the
          patience of a sick man so much as I do when I am sick myself: then
          patience is an extraordinary virtue. Women suffer, and suffer well;
          but I do think there are very few men who could bear the tithe of the
          suffering that many women endure, without exhibiting a hundred times
          as much impatience. Most of us who are gifted with strong
          constitutions, and have but little of sickness, have to chasten
          ourselves, that what little sickness we have to contend with is borne
          with so little resignation and with so much impatience; that we are so
          ready to repine, so prepared to bow our heads and wish we were dead,
          because a little pain is rending our body. Here it is that we prove
          our weakness indeed. Ah! people of God, it is one thing to talk about
          the furnace; it is another thing to be in it. It is one thing to look
          at the doctor's knife, but quite another thing to feel it. You will
          find it one thing to sip the cup of medicine, but quite another thing
          to lie in bed a dreary week or month, and to drink on, and on, and on
          of that nauseating draught. When you are on dry land most of you are
          good sailors; out at sea you are vastly different. There is many a man
          who makes a wonderfully brave soldier till he gets into the battle,
          and then he wishes himself miles away, and except his spurs there is
          no weapon he can use with much advantage. That man has never been sick
          who does not know his weakness, his want of patience and of endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, beloved, there is another thing which will very soon prove our
          weakness, if neither duty nor suffering will do it -- namely,
          progress. You sit down to-morrow and you read the life of some eminent
          servant of God: perhaps the life of David Brainard, and how he gave up
          his life for his Master in the wilderness, or the heroic life of Henry
          Martin, and how he sacrificed all for Christ: and as you read you say
          within yourself, |I will endeavor to be like this man; I will seek to
          have his faith, his self denial, his love to never-dying souls| Try
          and get them, beloved, and you will soon find your own weakness. I
          have sometimes thought I would try to have more faith but I have found
          it very hard to keep as much as I had. I have thought, |I will love my
          Saviour more,| and it was right that I should strive to do so; but
          when I sought to love him more I found that perhaps I was going
          backward instead of forward. How often do we find out our weakness
          when God answers our prayers!
        </p>
        <p>|I ask'd the Lord that I might grow</p>
        <p>In faith, and love, and every grace;</p>
        <p>Might more of his salvation know</p>
        <p>And seek more earnestly his face.</p>
        <p>I hop'd that in some favor'd hour</p>
        <p>At once he'd answer my request,</p>
        <p>And by his love's constraining power,</p>
        <p>Subdue my sins, and give me rest.</p>
        <p>Instead of this he made me feel</p>
        <p>The hidden evils of my heart,</p>
        <p>And let the angry power of hell</p>
        <p>Assault my soul in every part.</p>
        <p>'Lord why is this?' I trembling cried</p>
        <p>'Wilt thou pursue thy worm to death?'</p>
        <p>'Tis in this way,' the Lord replied;</p>
        <p>'I answer prayer for grace and faith.'|</p>
        <p>
          That is, the Lord helps us to grow downward when we are only thinking
          about growing upward. Let any of you try to grow in grace, and seek to
          run the heavenly race, and make a little progress, and you will soon
          find, in such a slippery road as that which we have to travel, that it
          is very hard to go one step forward, though remarkably easy to go a
          great many steps backward.
        </p>
        <p>
          If neither of these three things will prove thy weakness, Christian, I
          will advise thee to try another. See what thou art in temptation. I
          have seen a tree in the forest that seemed to stand fast like a rock,
          I have stood beneath its widespreading branches, and have sought to
          shake its trunk, to see if I could, but it stood immovable. The sun
          shone upon it, and the rain descended, and many a winter's frost
          sprinkled its boughs with snow, but it still stood fast and firm. But
          one night there came a howling wind which swept through the forest,
          and the tree that seemed to stand so fast lay stretched along the
          ground, its gaunt arms which once were lifted up to heaven lying
          hopelessly broken, and the trunk snapped in twain. And so have I seen
          many a professor strong and mighty, and nothing seemed to move him;
          but I have seen the wind of persecution and temptation come against
          him, and I have heard him creak with murmuring, and at last have seen
          him break in apostasy and he has lain along the ground a mournful
          specimen of what every man must become who maketh not the Lord his
          strength, and who relieth not upon the Most High. |Ah!| says one, |I
          do not believe I could be tempted to sin.| My friend, it depends upon
          what kind of temptation it should be. There are many of us who could
          not be tempted to drunkenness, and others who could not he tempted to
          lust. If the devil should set before some of you cups of the richest
          wines that ever came from the vintages of Burgundy or of Xeres, you
          would not care for them, if you did but sip them it would suffice you;
          it would be in vain to tempt you with the drunkard's song; nothing
          could induce you to lose your equilibrium by intoxicating liquors; but
          perhaps you are the very man whom a temptation of lust might
          overthrow. While there be other men whom neither lust nor wine can
          overcome, who may be led by a prospect of profit into that which is
          dishonest; and others again, whom neither profit, nor lust, nor wine,
          would turn aside, may be overthrown by anger, or envy, or malice. We
          have all our tender points. When Thetis dipped Achilles in the Styx,
          you remember she held him by the heel; he was made invulnerable
          wherever the water touched him, but his heel not being covered with
          the water, was vulnerable, and there Paris shot his arrow, and he
          died. It is even so with us. We may think that we are covered with
          virtue till we are totally invulnerable, but we have a heel somewhere;
          there is a place where the arrow of the devil can make way: hence the
          absolute necessity of taking to ourselves |the whole armor of God,| so
          that there may not be a solitary joint in the harness that shall be
          unprotected against the arrows of the devil. Satan is very crafty; he
          knows the ins and outs of manhood. There is many an old castle that
          has stood against every attack, but at last some traitor from within
          has gone without, and said |I know an old deserted passage, a
          subterranean back way, that has not been used for many a-day. In such
          and such a field you will see an opening; clear away a heap of stones
          there, and I will lead you down the passage: you will then come to an
          old door, of which I have the key and I can let you in; and so by a
          back way I can lead you into the very heart of the citadel, which you
          may then easily capture.| It is so with Satan. Man knoweth not himself
          so well as Satan knows him. There are back ways and subterranean
          passages into man's heart which the devil doth well understand. and he
          who thinketh that he is safe, let him take heed lest he fall. That is
          not a bad hymn of Dr. Watts, after all, where he tells us that Samson
          was very strong while he wore his hair, but
        </p>
        <p>|Samson, when his hair was lost,</p>
        <p>Met the Philistines to his cost:</p>
        <p>Shook his vain limbs with vast surprise,</p>
        <p>Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.|</p>
        <p>
          The reason was, because there was a back way into Samson's heart. The
          Philistines could not overcome him: |Heaps upon heaps, with the
          jaw-bone of an ass, have I slain a thousand men.| Come on,
          Philistines, he will rend you in pieces as he did the young lion; bind
          him with green withes, and he will snap them as tow; weave his locks
          with a weaver's beam, and he will carry away loom and all, and go out
          like a giant refreshed with new wine. But, O Delilah, he hath a back
          way to his heart; thou hast found it out, and now thou canst overthrow
          him. Tremble, for ye may yet be overcome! Ye are as weak as water if
          God shall leave you alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think, if we have well surveyed these different points of our
          moral standing on earth, every child of God will be ready to confess
          that he is weak. I imagine there may be some of you ready to say,
          |Sir, I am nothing.| Then I shall reply, |Ah! you are a young
          Christian.| There will be others of you who will say, |Sir, I am less
          than nothing.| And I shall say, |Ah! you are an old Christian;| for
          the older Christians get, the less they become in their own esteem,
          the more they feel their own weakness, and the more entirely they rely
          upon the strength of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus dwelt upon the first point, we shall now come to the
          second -- THE GREAT PROMISE, -- |As thy days, so shall thy strength
          be.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, this is a well-guaranteed promise. A promise is
          nothing unless I have good security that it shall be fulfilled. It is
          in vain for men to promise largely unless their fulfillment shall be
          as large as their promise, for the largeness of their promise is just
          the largeness of deception. But here every word of God is true. God
          has issued no more notes for the bank of heaven than he can cash in an
          hour if he wills. There is enough bullion in the vaults of Omnipotence
          to pay off every bill that ever shall be drawn by the faith of man or
          the promises of God. Now look at this one -- |As thy days, so shall
          thy strength be.| Beloved, God has a strong reserve with which to pay
          off this promise; for is he not himself omnipotent, able to do all
          things? Believer, till thou canst drain dry the ocean of omnipotence,
          till thou canst break into pieces the towering mountains of almighty
          strength, thou never needest to fear. Until thine enemy can stop the
          course of a whirlwind with a reed, till he can twist the hurricane
          from its path by a word of his puny lip, thou needest not think that
          the strength of man shall ever be able to overcome the strength which
          is in thee, namely, the strength of God. Whilst the earth's huge
          pillars stand, thou hast enough to make thy faith firm. The same God
          who guides the stars in their courses, who directs the earth in its
          orbit, who feeds the burning furnace of the sun, and keeps the stars
          perpetually burning with their fires -- the same God has promised to
          supply thy strength. While he is able to do all these things, think
          not that he shall be unable to fulfill his own promise. Remember what
          he did in the days of old, in the former generations. Remember how he
          spoke and it was done; how he commanded, and it stood fast. Do you not
          see him in the black eternity? When there was nothing but grim
          darkness, there he stood -- the mighty Artificer: upon the anvil there
          he cast a hot mass of flame, and hammering it with his own ponderous
          arm, each spark that flew from it made a world; there those sparks are
          glittering now, the offspring of the anvil of the eternal purposes,
          and the hymned of his own majestic might. And shall he, that created
          the world, grow weary? Shall he fail? Shall he break his promises for
          want of strength? He hangeth the world upon nothing; he fixed the
          pillars of heaven in silver sockets of light and thereon he hung the
          golden lamps, the sun and the moon, and shall he that did all this be
          unable to support his children? Shall he be unfaithful to his word for
          want of power in his arm or strength in his will? Remember again, thy
          God, who has promised to be thy strength, is the God who upholdeth all
          things by the power of his hand. Who feedeth the ravens? Who supplies
          the lions? Doth not he do it? And how? He openeth his hand and
          supplieth the want of every living thing. He has to do nothing more
          than simply to open his hand. Who is it that restrains the tempest?
          Doth not he say that he rides upon the wings of the wind, that he
          maketh the clouds his chariots, and holds the water in the hollow of
          his hand? Shall he fail thee? When he has put such a promise as this
          on record, shalt thou for a moment indulge the thought that he has
          out-promised himself, and gone beyond his power to fulfill? Ah! no.
          Who was it that cut Rahab in pieces, and wounded the dragon? Who
          divided the Red Sea, and made the waters thereof stand upright as a
          heap? Who led the people through the wilderness? Who was it that did
          oust Pharoah into the depths of the sea, his chosen captains also, in
          the depth of the Red Sea? Who rained fire and brimstone out of heaven
          upon Sodom and Gomorrah? Who chased out the Canaanite with the hornet,
          and made a way of escape for his people Israel? Who was it that
          brought them again from their captivity and did settle them again in
          their own land? Who is he that hath put down kings, yea and slew
          mighty kings, that he might make room for his people wherein they
          might dwell in a quiet habitation? Hath not the Lord done it: and is
          his arm shortened that he cannot save: or is his ear heavy that he
          cannot hear? O thou who art my God and my strength, I can believe that
          this promise shall be fulfilled for the boundless reservoir of thy
          grace can never be exhausted, and the unlimitable storehouse of thy
          strength can never be emptied or rifled by the enemy. It is, then, a
          well guaranteed promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now I want you to notice it is a limited promise. |What!| says
          one, |limited| Why it says, As thy days, so shall thy strength be.' |
          Ay, it is limited. I know it is unlimited in our troubles, but still
          it is limited. First, it says our strength is to be as our days are;
          it does not say our strength is to be as our desires are. Oh! how
          often have we thought, |How I wish I were as strong as so and so| --
          one who had a great deal of faith. Ah! but then you would have rather
          more faith than you wanted, and what would be the good of that? It
          would be like the manna the children of Israel had -- if they did not
          eat it in the day it bred worms and stank. |Still,| says one, |if I
          had faith like so-and-so, I think I should do wonders.| Yes, but you
          would get the glory of them. That is why God does not let you have the
          faith, because he does not want you to do wonders. That is reserved
          for God, not for you, -- |He only doeth wondrous things.| Once more,
          it does not say, our strength shall be as our fears. God often leaves
          us to shift alone with our fears, -- never with our troubles. Many of
          God's people have a manufactory at the back of their houses in which
          they manufacture troubles; and home-made troubles, like other home
          made things, last a very long while, and generally fit very
          comfortably. Troubles of God's sending are always suitable -- the
          right sort for our backs; but those that we make are of the wrong
          sort, and they always last us longer than God's; I have known an old
          lady sit and fret because she believed she should die in a workhouse
          and she wanted God to give her grace accordingly; but what would have
          been the good of that? because the Lord meant that she should die in
          her own quiet bedroom? I have heard of and known men who, being sick,
          believed they were dying, and wanted grace to die complacently; but
          God would not give it because he intended them to live, and why should
          he give them dying grace till they came to die? And we have known
          others who said they wanted grace to endure many troubles which they
          expected to come upon them. They were going to fail in a fortnight or
          so, but they did not fail and it was no wonder they had not grace
          given to carry them through it, because they did not require it. The
          promise is |As thy days, so shall thy strength be.| |When your vessel
          gets empty then will I fill it; I will not give you any extra, over
          and above. When you are weak then I will make you strong; but I will
          not give you any extra strength to lay by: strength enough to bear
          your sufferings, and to do your duty; but no strength to play at
          matches with your brethren and sisters in order to get the glory to
          yourselves.| Oh! if we had strength according to our wishes we should
          soon all of us be like Jeshurun, -- wax fat, and begin to kick against
          the Most High. Then again, there is another limit. It says |As thy
          days so shall thy strength be.| It does not any, |as thy weeks,| or
          |months,| but |as thy days.| You are not going to have Monday's grace
          given you on a Sunday, nor Tuesday's grace on a Monday. You shall have
          Monday's grace given you on Monday morning as soon as you rise and
          want it; you shall not have it given you on Saturday night; you shall
          have it |day by day| -- no more than you want, no less than you want.
          I do not believe God's people are to be trusted with a week's grace
          all at once. They are like many of our London workman: they get their
          wages on Saturday night, and then the rascals go and have Saint Monday
          and Saint Tuesday, and never do a stroke of work till Wednesday, when
          they go to the pawnbrokers with their tools to help them over till the
          next Saturday night. Now, I think God's children would do the same. If
          they had grace given them on Saturday to last them all through the
          week, I question whether the devil would not get a good deal of it, --
          whether they would not be pawning some of their old evidences before
          the week was out, in order to live upon them: spending all their grace
          on Monday and Tuesday. spending very much of their strength in
          indulging in pride and boasting, instead of walking humbly with their
          God. No, |as thy days, so shall thy strength be.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, having said that the promise is limited, perhaps I am bound to
          add -- what an extensive promise this is! |As thy days, so shall thy
          strength be.| Some days are very little things, in our pocket book we
          have very little to put down, for there was nothing done of any
          importance. But some days are very big days. Ah! I have known a big
          day -- a day of great duties, when great things had to be done for God
          -- too great, it seemed, for one man to do; and when great duty was
          but half done there came great trouble, such as my poor heart had
          never felt before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! what a great day it was! there was a night of lamentation in this
          place, and the cry of weeping, and of mourning, and of death. Ah! but
          blessed be God's name, though the day was big with tempest, and though
          it swelled with horror, yet as that day was, so was God's strength.
          Look at poor Job. What a great day he had once! |Master,| says one,
          |The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them, and the
          Sabeans fell upon them and took them away.| In comes another and he
          says, |The fire of God hath fallen on the sheep.| |Oh,| says another
          |the Chaldeans have fallen upon the camels and taken them away, and I,
          only I, am left to tell thee.| Still, you see, grace kept growing with
          the day. Still strength grew as the trouble grew. At last comes the
          back stroke: |A great wind came from the wilderness, and smote the
          house where thy sons and daughters were feasting, and they are dead,
          and I, only I, am left to tell thee.| Grace still kept growing, and at
          last the grace did overflow the trouble, and the poor old patriarch
          cried, |The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
          name of the Lord.| Ah! Job, that was a big day indeed, and it was big
          grace that went with that big day. Satan sometimes blows up our days
          with his black breath till they grow to such a cursed height that we
          know not how great the days must be. Our head whirls at the thought of
          passing through such a sea of trouble in so short a space of time. But
          oh! how sweet it is to think that the bed of grace is never shorter
          than a man can stretch himself upon it; nor is the covering of
          Almighty love ever shorter than that it may cover us. We never need be
          afraid. If our troubles should become high as mountains. God's grace
          would become like Noah s flood: it would go twenty cubits higher till
          the mountains were covered. If God should send to you and to me a day
          such as there was none like it, neither should be any more, he would
          send us strength such as there was none like it, neither should there
          be any more. Do you see Martin Luther riding into Worms? There is a
          solitary monk going before a great council: he knows they will burn
          him; did not they burn John Huss, and Jerome of Prague? Both those men
          had a safe conduct, and it was violated and they were put to death by
          Papists, who said that no faith was to be kept with heretics. Luther
          placed very little reliance on his safe conduct; and you would have
          expected as he rode into Worms that he would have a dejected
          countenance. Not so. No sooner does he catch sight of Worms, than some
          one advises him not to go into the city. Said he, |If there were as
          many devils in Worms as there are tiles on the roofs of the houses, I
          would enter.| And he does ride in. He goes to the inn, and eats his
          bread and drinks his beer, as complacently as if he were at his own
          fire-side; and then he goes quietly to bed. When summoned before the
          council, and asked to retract his opinion, he does not want time to
          consider, or debate about it; but he says, |These things that I have
          written are the truth of God, and by them will I stand till I die; so
          help me God!| The whole assembly trembles, but there is not a flush
          upon the cheek of the brave monk, nor do his knees knock together. He
          is in the midst of armed men and those that seek his blood. There sit
          fierce cardinals and bloodthirsty bishops and the Pope's legate; like
          spiders longing to suck his blood. He cares for none of them; he walks
          away, and is confident that |God is his refuge and strength, a very
          present help in trouble.| |Ah! but,| you say, |I could not do that.||
          Yea you could, if God called you to it. Any child of God can do what
          any other child of God has done, if God gives him the strength. You
          could not do what you are doing even now, without God's strength; and
          you could do ten thousand times more, if he should be pressed to fill
          you with his might. What an expansive promise this is!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, what a varying promise it is! I do not mean that the
          promise varies but adapts itself to all our changes. |As thy days, so
          shall thy strength be.| Here is a fine sunshiny morning; all the world
          is laughing; everything looks glad; the birds are singing, the trees
          seem to be all alive with music. |My strength shall be as my day is,|
          says the pilgrim. Ah! pilgrim, there is a little black cloud
          gathering. Soon it increases; the flash of lightning wounds the
          heaven, and it begins to bleed in showers. Pilgrim, |As thy days, so
          shall thy strength be.| The birds have done singing, and the world has
          done laughing; but |as thy days, so shall thy strength be.| Now the
          dark night comes on, and another day approaches -- a day of tempest,
          and whirlwind, and storm. Dost thou tremble, pilgrim? -- |As thy days,
          so shall thy strength be.| |But there are robbers in the wood.| -- |As
          thy days, so shall thy strength be.| |But there are lions which shall
          devour me.| -- |As thy days. so shall thy strength be.| |But there are
          rivers: how shall I swim them?| Here is a boat to carry thee over: |As
          thy days, so shall thy strength be.| |But there are fires: how shall I
          pass through them?| Here is the garment that will protect thee: |As
          thy days so shall thy strength be.| |But there are arrows that fly by
          day.| Here is thy shield: |As thy days so shall thy strength be.| |But
          there is the pestilence that walketh in darkness.| Here is thy
          antidote: |As thy days so shall thy strength be.| Wherever you may be,
          and whatever trouble awaits you, |As thy days, so shall thy strength
          be.| Children of God, cannot you say that this has been true hitherto?
          I can. It might seem egotistical if I were to talk of the evidence I
          have received of this during the past week, but nevertheless I cannot
          help recording my praise to God. I left this pulpit last Sunday as
          sick as any man ever left the pulpit, and I left this country too as
          ill as I could be, but no sooner had I set my foot upon the other
          shore, where I was to preach the gospel, than my wonted strength
          entirely returned to me. I had no sooner buckled on the harness to go
          forth and fight my Master's battle, than every ache and pain was gone,
          and all my sickness fled; and as my day was, so certainly was my
          strength. I believe if I were lying upon a dying couch, if God called
          me to preach in America, and I had but faith to be carried down to the
          boat, I should have strength given me, though I seemed to be dying, to
          minister as the Lord had appointed me. And so would each of you,
          wherever you might be find that as your day was, so your strength
          should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, in conclusion, what a long promise this is! You may live till you
          are never so old, but this promise will outlive you. When thou comest
          into the depths of the river Jordan, |as thy days, so shall thy
          strength be;| thou shalt have confidence to face the last grim tyrant,
          and grace to smile even in the jaws of the grave. And when thou shalt
          rise again in the terrible morning of the resurrection, |as thy days,
          so shall thy strength be:| though the earth be reeling with dismay
          thou shalt know no fear; though the heavens are tottering with
          confusion thou shalt know no trouble. |As thy days, so shall thy
          strength be.| And when thou shalt see God face to face, though thy
          weakness were enough to make thee die, thou shalt have strength to
          bear the beatific vision: thou shalt see him face to face, and thou
          shalt live; thou shalt lie in the bosom of thy God; immortalized and
          made full of strength, thou shalt be able to bear even the brightness
          of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. What INFERENCE shall I draw except this? Children of the living
          God, be rid of your doubts, be rid of your trouble and your fear.
          Young Christians, do not be afraid to set forward on the heavenly
          race. You bashful Christians, that, like Nicodemus, are ashamed to
          come out and make an open profession, don't be afraid, |As your day
          is, so shall your strength be.| Why need you fear? You are afraid of
          disgracing your profession, you shall not; your day shall never be
          more troublesome, or more fun of temptation, than your strength shall
          be full of deliverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as for you that have not God to be yours, I must draw one
          inference for you. Your strength is decaying. You are growing old, and
          your old age will not be like your youth, You have strength --
          strength which you prostitute to the cause of Satan, which you misuse
          in the service of the devil. When you grow old, as you will do, unless
          your wickedness shall bring you to an early grave; they that look out
          of the windows must be darkened, and the grasshopper must be burden to
          you; and your strength shall not be as your day. And when you come to
          die, as die you must, then you shall have no strength to die with; you
          must die alone; you must hear yon iron gates creak on their hinges,
          and no guardian angel to comfort you as you go through the dreary
          vault. And you must stand at God's great bar at the day of
          resurrection, and no one to strengthen you there. How will your cheek
          blanch with terror! How will your soul be affrighted with horror when
          you shall hear it said, |Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire in
          hell, prepared for the devil and his angels.| You have no such promise
          as this to cheer you onward, but you have this to drive you to
          despair: your days shall become heavier, but your strength shall
          become lighter; your sorrows shall be multiplied, and your joys shall
          be diminished; your days shall shorten, and your nights shall
          lengthen; your summers shall become dimmer and your winters shall
          become blacker; all your hopes shall die, and your fears shall live.
          Ye shall reap the harvest of your sins in the dreadful vintage of
          eternal wrath. May God give us all grace, so that when days and years
          are past, we all may meet in heaven. There are some people here that I
          have seen a great many times, and I thought they would have been
          converted before now. I ask them one question, (there are some of them
          whom I sincerely respect) and it is this -- what will you do in the
          swellings of Jordan? When death shall get hold upon you? What, what
          will you do then? May God help you to answer and prepare to meet
          Him!<br />
