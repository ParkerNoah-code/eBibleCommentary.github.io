        <p>The Epistle.</p>
        <p>On the translation of bishops and of episcopal seats.</p>
        <p>
          To the brethren, most dearly beloved, constituted to be bishops in the
          provinces of Boetica and Toletana, Bishop Anterus sends greeting in
          the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should wish, my dearest brethren, always to receive the glad account
          of your sincere love and peace, so that the signs of your welfare
          might be promoted in turn by the dissemination of our letters among
          you, if our ancient enemy should give us quiet and deliverance from
          his attacks; who was a liar from the beginning, the enemy of the
          truth, the rival of man -- in order to deceive whom he first deceived
          himself, -- the adversary of modesty, the master of luxury. He feeds
          on cruelties; he is punished by abstinence; he hates fasts, and his
          ministers preach, to that effect, as he declares them to be
          superfluous, having no hope of the future, and echoing that sentence
          of the apostle, in which he says, |Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
          we shall die.| O miserable boldness! O subtlety of a desperate mind!
          For he exhorts to hatred, and puts concord to flight. And because the
          mind of man is easily drawn over to the worse part, and chooses rather
          to walk by the broad way than laboriously to take its course by the
          narrow way, for this reason, brethren most dearly beloved, follow ye
          the better, and always leave the worse behind you. Do good, avoid
          evil, in order that ye may be found to be the disciples of the Lord in
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, of the transference of bishops, on which subject it has been your
          wish to consult the holy seat of the apostles, know ye that that may
          lawfully be done for the sake of the common good, or when it is
          absolutely necessary, but not at the mere will or bidding of any
          individual. Peter, our holy master, and the prince of the apostles,
          was translated for the sake of the common good from Antioch to Rome,
          in order that he might be in a position there of doing more service.
          Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor city to Alexandria
          by apostolic authority. In like manner Felix, on account of the
          doctrine and the good life which he maintained, was translated by the
          common consent of the bishops and the other priests, and the people
          from the city in which, on the election of the citizens, he had been
          ordained, to Ephesus. For that man is not chargeable with shifting
          from city to city who does not do that of his own inclination or by
          the force of ambition, but who is transferred for the general good, or
          in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the consent of
          the chief parties. Nor can he be said to transfer himself from a
          smaller city to a larger, who is placed in that position not by his
          own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being driven out of
          his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some necessity,
          and who without pride and in humility has been translated and
          installed there by others for the good of the place or the people: for
          man looketh on the countenance, but the Lord seeth the heart. And the
          Lord, speaking by the prophet, says, |The Lord knows the thoughts of
          men, that they are vanity.| That man, therefore, does not change his
          seat who does not change his mind. Nor does he change his city who is
          changed not of his own will, but by the decision and election of
          others. And accordingly he does not shift from city to city who does
          not leave his own city for the sake of gain to himself, or of his own
          choice, but who, as has already been said, has been translated to
          another city either in consequence of being driven out of his own
          seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue of the election and
          injunction of the priests and people. For as the bishops have power
          regularly to ordain bishops and other orders of priests, so, as often
          as any matter of advantage or necessity constrains them, they have
          power in the above-mentioned manner both to transfer and to install.
          As ye have asked our opinion in these matters, though they are not
          subjects unknown to you, we give you these things in charge to hold
          them, lest, through the ignorance of some, that which is better and
          more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be taken up,
          even as we read in the holy Gospel: |Woe unto you, hypocrites! for ye
          pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the
          weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought
          ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides,
          which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.| What is lawful is with
          them not lawful, and what is not lawful is lawful. Even as Jannes and
          Mambres resisted the truth, so do they, being reprobate in mind, and
          lovers of pleasure rather than of God, teach that that is unlawful
          which is lawful, to wit, that bishops should shift from city to city
          in the manner already noted; and what is unlawful they teach as
          lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to those who endure straits:
          that is to say, they deny that a bishop belonging to another city
          should be bestowed for good, or for necessity's sake, upon those who
          have no bishop, and who want the sacred episcopal ministry; and that
          another episcopal seat should be assigned to bishops who endure
          persecution or straits. They contradict the sacred Scripture also,
          which testifies that God desireth mercy rather than judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          What greater charity, I pray you, can there be, or what more
          profitable service of piety, on the part of any one to another, than
          to deliver him from the darkness of ignorance and the thick darkness
          of inexperience, and restore him, in fine, by the nutriment of the
          doctrine of the true faith, not for gain indeed, or ambition, but for
          instruction and edification? [For he becomes, so to speak, the hand
          for the maimed, the foot for the lame, the eye for the blind, who
          unlocks the treasure of wisdom and knowledge to one wrapped in the
          darkness of ignorance, and opens up to such an one the brightness of
          the light and the ways of the Lord.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for both parties -- namely, for those who endure a famine of the
          word of God, and for bishops who endure straits, when they are
          installed in other cities for the common good -- no small degree of
          mercy is shown. And they who deny this, although they have the form of
          godliness, do yet deny the power thereof. For in such a matter I make
          no recognition of race (prosapiam). If, however, any one of the wise,
          whom the stress of this storm (or season) has allied with other
          leaders among the unwise, is stained with a participation in their
          deeds, yet the excellence of the wise man, although he may chance to
          be privy to their offences, makes him incapable of giving himself as a
          leader to sinners. The cause of public good and necessity is one
          thing, and the cause of self-seeking, and presumption, or private
          inclination, is another thing. On account of self-seeking, or
          presumption, or private inclination, bishops are not to be transferred
          from one city to another, but only on account of public good and
          necessity. And this is a matter which no one denies, except those of
          whom it is said, |They have erred through wine; they have not known
          the seer; they have been ignorant of judgment.| For if I were
          constrained to open up in narration things that have been brought to
          end, I would show you that no comfort comes from the comparison of
          such deeds. But, most dearly beloved, |stand ye in the ways, and see,
          and ask for the old paths of the Lord, and see what is the good way
          and the right, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your
          souls.| And, to speak according to the word of Wisdom: |Love
          righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in
          goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek Him. For He is found of them
          that tempt Him not, and showeth Himself unto such as do not distrust
          Him. For froward thoughts separate from God; and His power, when it is
          tried, reproveth the unwise. For into a malicious soul wisdom shall
          not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. For the
          holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts
          that are without understanding, and will not abide when
          unrighteousness cometh in. For wisdom is a benign spirit, and will not
          acquit a blasphemer of His words. For God is witness of his reins, and
          a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. For the
          Spirit of the Lord hath filled the world, and that which containeth
          all things hath knowledge of the voice. Therefore he that speaketh
          unrighteous things cannot be hid; neither shall vengeance, when it
          punisheth, pass by him. For inquisition shall be made into the
          counsels of the ungodly. And the sound of his words shall come unto
          the Lord, and unto the manifestation of his wicked deeds; for the ear
          of jealousy heareth all things, and the noise of murmurings shall not
          be hid. Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and
          refrain your tongue from backbiting, for there is no word so secret
          that it shall go for nought. The mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.
          Seek not death in the error of your life, and pull not upon yourself
          destruction with the works of your hands; for God made not death,
          neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living. For He
          created all things that they might have their being, and He wished the
          nations of the world to be healthful. There is no poison of
          destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth of the
          living. Righteousness is perpetual and immortal, but unrighteousness
          is the acquisition of death. And ungodly men with their hands and
          words called it to them; and when they thought to have it their
          friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it; because
          they are worthy of death who take part with it.| |For they said,
          reasoning with themselves, but not aright, The time of our life is
          short and tedious; and in the death of a man there is no remedy,
          neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave. For
          we are born of nothing, and we shall be hereafter as though we had
          never been. For the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and speech is
          a little spark for the moving of our heart; which being extinguished,
          our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as
          the soft air. And our life shall pass as the trace of a cloud, and
          shall be dispersed as a mist that is driven away with the beams of the
          sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. And our name shall be
          forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance. For
          our time is a very shadow that passeth away, and after our end there
          is no returning; for it is fast sealed, and no man shall come again.|
          And for this reason every one must see to it that he keep himself with
          all care, and watch himself for his own good, so that when his last
          day and the end of his life come upon him, he may not pass over to
          everlasting death, but to eternal life. For the deeds of those put
          under us are judged by us, but our own doth God judge. Sometimes,
          moreover, bishops are perverted through the fault of the people, to
          the end that those fall more precipitately who follow them. When the
          head languisheth, the other members of the body are affected thereby.
          And viler are those who corrupt the life and morals of the good, than
          those who spoil the property and goods of others. Let each one take
          care that he have neither an itching tongue nor itching ears; that is
          to say, that he neither be a detractor of others himself, nor listen
          to others in their detractions. |Thou sattest,| saith he, |and spakest
          against thy brother; and thou didst slander thine own mother's son.|
          Let every individual abstain from a detracting tongue, and keep a
          guard upon his own words, and understand that all that they say of
          others shall enter into the judgment wherewith they themselves shall
          be judged. No one readily refers to an unwilling auditor. Let it be
          the care of all of you, most dearly beloved, to keep not only your
          eyes, but also your tongue, pure. And let not another house ever know
          by your means what is done in any man's house. Let all have the
          simplicity of the dove, that they devise not guile against any one;
          and the subtlety of the serpent, that they be not ever thrown by the
          crafty designs of others. It does not belong to my humble station and
          measure to judge others, and to say anything unfavourable of the
          ministers of the churches. Far be it from me that I should say
          anything unfavourable of those who are the successors to the apostolic
          status, and make the body of Christ with their sacred mouth; by whose
          instrumentality we too are Christians, and who have the keys of the
          kingdom of heaven, and exercise judgment before the day of judgment.
          Moreover, it is contained in the ancient law, that whoever has not
          given obedience to the priests should either be stoned outside the
          camp by the people, or with his neck beneath the sword should expiate
          his presumption by his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, however, the disobedient is cut off by spiritual chastisement;
          and being cast out of the church, is torn by the rabid mouth of
          demons. For it becomes those who have God in their heritage, to serve
          God free from all the hindrances of the world, so that they may be
          able to say, |The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.| |O how
          good and pleasant is Thy Spirit, O Lord, in all things!| And Thou
          sparest all because they are Thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.
          Therefore chastenest Thou them by little and little that offend, and
          warnest them of those things wherein they offend, and dost address
          them, that leaving their wickedness, they may believe on Thee, O
          Lord.| |But Thou, our God, art gracious and true, long-suffering, and
          in mercy ordering all things. For if we sin, we are Thine, knowing Thy
          power. And if we sin not, we know that we are counted Thine.| |The
          spirit of those that fear the Lord shall be required of him; and in
          His regard they shall be blessed.| Wherefore, most beloved brethren,
          |let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
          which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to
          the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
          sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and
          anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all
          malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
          another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.| |Be ye therefore
          followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also
          hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a
          sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour. But fornication, and all
          uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as
          becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting,
          which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks. For this know
          ye, understanding that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
          covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
          of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for
          because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
          disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. For ye were
          sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children
          of light (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and
          righteousness, and truth), proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
          And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
          rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things
          which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are
          made manifest by the light: for whatsoever is made manifest
          (manifestatur) is light. Wherefore He saith, Awake, thou that
          sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
          See then that ye walk circumspectly, brethren, not as fools, but as
          wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye
          not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not
          drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Holy
          Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual
          songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; giving
          thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of
          our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting yourselves one to another in the
          fear of Christ.| Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the
          tradition of the apostles and the apostolic seat, |that our Lord Jesus
          Christ and our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us
          everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, may comfort your
          hearts, and stablish you in every good work and word.| |Finally,
          brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course,
          and be glorified, even as it is with you, and that we may be delivered
          from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith. But the
          Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.|
          Wherefore set your hearts continually in the strength (virtute) of
          God, and always resist the wicked, and tell these things, according to
          the word of the prophet, |to the generations following; for this God
          is our God unto eternity, and He will rule us for ever and ever.|
          Hence ye who are set for examples (in specula) by the Lord, ought by
          all means to check and keep back those who devise crafty counsels
          against the brethren, or excite against them seditions and slanders.
          For it is an easy thing to deceive man with a word, but it is not so
          with the Lord. Wherefore ye ought to reprehend such persons, and turn
          away from them, to the end that, all darkness of this manner being
          completely done away, the Morning Star may shine upon them, and
          gladness arise in their hearts. |And we have confidence in the Lord
          touching you, brethren, that ye both do and will do the things which
          we command you.| For the more ye show forth your kindnesses to them,
          the greater a return have ye to look for from the omnipotent God whom
          they serve. May the omnipotent God keep you in His protection, and
          grant you to maintain honour and precept; and may glory and honour be
          to God the Father Almighty, and to His only-begotten Son our Saviour,
          with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given on the 12th day before the kalends of April (the 21st of March),
