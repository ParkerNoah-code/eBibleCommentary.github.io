[a.d.126.] Quadratus is spoken of by Eusebius as a |man of understanding and of Apostolic faith.| And he celebrates Aristides as a man of similar character. These were the earliest apologists; both addressed their writings to Hadrian, and they were extant and valued in the churches in the time of Eusebius.</p><p>From the Apology for the Christian Religion. </p><p>Our Saviour's works, moreover, were always present: for they were real, consisting of those who had been healed of their diseases, those who had been raised from the dead; who were not only seen whilst they were being healed and raised up, but were afterwards constantly present. Nor did they remain only during the sojourn of the Saviour on earth, but also a considerable time after His departure; and, indeed, some of them have survived even down to our own times. </p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
