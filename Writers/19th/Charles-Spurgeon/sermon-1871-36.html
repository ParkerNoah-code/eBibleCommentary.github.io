        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1003)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, July 30th, 1871, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>|Your own salvation.| -- Philippians 2:12.</p>
        <p>
          WE SELECT THE WORDS, |your own salvation,| as our text this morning,
          not out of any singularity, or from the slightest wish that the
          brevity of the text should surprise you; but because our subject will
          be the more clearly before you if only these three words are
          announced. If I had nominally taken the whole verse I could not have
          attempted to expound it without distracting your attention from the
          topic which now weighs upon my heart. O that the divine Spirit may
          bring home to each one of your minds the unspeakable importance of
          |your own salvation|!
        </p>
        <p>
          We have heard it said by hearers that they come to listen to us, and
          we talk to them upon subjects in which they have no interest. You will
          not be able to make this complaint to-day, for we shall speak only of
          |your own salvation;| and nothing can more concern you. It has
          sometimes been said that preachers frequently select very unpractical
          themes. No such objection can be raised to-day, for nothing can be
          more practical than this; nothing more needful than to urge you to see
          to |your own salvation.| We have even heard it said that ministers
          delight in abstruse subjects, paradoxical dogmas, and mysterious
          surpassing comprehension; but, assuredly, we will keep to plain
          sailing this morning. No sublime doctrines, no profound questions
          shall perplex you; you shall only be called on to consider |your own
          salvation:| a very homely theme, and a very simple one, but for all
          that, the most weighty that can be brought before you. I shall seek
          after simple words also, and plain sentences, to suit the simplicity
          and plainness of the subject, that there may be no thought whatever
          about the speaker's language, but only concerning this one, sole, only
          topic, |your own salvation.| I ask you all, as reasonable men who
          would not injure or neglect yourselves, to lend me your most serious
          attention. Chase away the swarming vanities which buzz around you, and
          let each man think for himself upon his |own salvation.| O may the
          Spirit of God set each one of you apart in a mental solitude, and
          constrain you each one, singly, to face the truth concerning his own
          state! Each man apart, each woman apart; the father apart, and the
          child apart: may you now come before the Lord in solemn thought, and
          may nothing occupy your attention but this: |your own salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We will begin this morning's meditation by noting THE MATTER UNDER
          CONSIDERATION -- Salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation! a great word, not always understood, often narrowed down,
          and its very marrow overlooked. Salvation! This concerns every one
          here present. We all fell in our first parent; we have all sinned
          personally; we shall all perish unless we find salvation. The word
          salvation contains within it deliverance from the guilt of our past
          sins. We have broken God's law each one of us, more or less
          flagrantly; we have all wandered the downward road, though each has
          chosen a different way. Salvation brings to us the blotting out of the
          transgressions of the past, acquital from criminality, purging from
          all guiltiness, that we may stand accepted before the great Judge.
          What man in his sober senses will deny that forgiveness is an
          unspeakably desirable blessing!
        </p>
        <p>
          But salvation means more than that: it includes deliverance from the
          power of sin. Naturally we are all fond of evil, and we run after it
          greedily; we are the bondslaves of iniquity, and we love the bondage.
          This last is the worst feature of the case. But when salvation comes
          it delivers the man from the power of sin. He learns that it is evil,
          and he regards it as such, loathes it, repents that he has ever been
          in love with it, turns his back upon it, becomes, through God's
          Spirit, the master of his lusts, puts the flesh beneath his feet, and
          rises into the liberty of the children of God. Alas! there are many
          who do not care for this: if this be salvation they would not give a
          farthing for it. They love their sins; they rejoice to follow the
          devices and imaginations of their own corrupt hearts. Yet be assured,
          this emancipation from bad habits, unclean desires, and carnal
          passions is the main point in salvation, and if it be not ours,
          salvation in its other branches is not and cannot be enjoyed by us.
          Dear hearer, dost thou possess salvation from sin? hast thou escaped
          the corruption which is in the world through lust? If not, what hast
          thou to do with salvation? To any right-minded man deliverance from
          unholy principles is regarded as the greatest of all blessings. What
          thinkest thou of it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation includes deliverance from the present wrath of God which
          abides upon the unsaved man every moment of his life. Every person who
          is unforgiven is the object of divine wrath. |God is angry with the
          wicked every day. If he turn not, he will whet his sword.| |Be that
          believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in
          the name of the only begotten Son of God.| I frequently hear the
          statement that this is a state of probation. This is a great mistake,
          for our probation has long since passed. Sinners have been proved, and
          found to be unworthy; they have been |weighed in the balances,| and
          |found wanting.| If you have not believed in Jesus, condemnation
          already rests upon you: you are reprieved awhile, but your
          condemnation is recorded. Salvation takes a man from under the cloud
          of divine wrath, and reveals to him the divine love. Be can then say,
          |O God, I will praise thee, though thou wast angry with me, thine
          anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me.| Oh, it is not hell
          hereafter which is the only thing a sinner has to fear, it is the
          wrath of God which rests upon him now. To be unreconciled to God now
          is an awful thing: to have God's arrow pointed at you as it is at this
          moment, even though it fly not from the string as yet, is a terrible
          thing. It is enough to make you tremble from head to foot when you
          learn that you are the target of Jehovah's wrath: |he hath bent his
          bow, and made it ready.| Every soul that is unreconciled to God by the
          blood of his Son is in the gall of bitterness. Salvation at once sets
          us free from this state of danger and alienation. We are no longer the
          |children of wrath, even as others,| but are made children of God and
          joint heirs with a Christ Jesus. What can be conceived more precious
          than this?
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, we lastly receive that part of salvation which ignorant
          persons put first, and make to be the whole of salvation. In
          consequence of our being delivered from the guilt of sin, and from the
          power of sin, and from the present wrath of God, we are delivered from
          the future wrath of God. Unto the uttermost will that wrath descend
          upon the souls of men when they leave the body and stand before their
          Maker's bar, if they depart this life unsaved. To die without
          salvation is to enter into damnation. Where death leaves us there
          judgment finds us; and where judgment finds us eternity will hold Us
          forever and ever. |He which is filthy, let him be filthy still,| and
          he that is wretched as a punishment for being filthy, shall be
          hopelessly wretched still. Salvation delivers the soul from going down
          into the pit of hell. We, being justified, are no longer liable to
          punishment, because we are no longer chargeable with guilt. Christ
          Jesus bore the wrath of God that we might never bear it. He has made a
          full atonement to the justice of God for the sins of all believers.
          Against him that believeth there remaineth no record of guilt; his
          transgressions are blotted out, for a Christ Jesus hath finished
          transgression, made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting
          righteousness. What a comprehensive word then is this -- |salvation|!
          It is a triumphant deliverance from the guilt of sin, from the
          dominion of it, from the curse of it, from the punishment of it, and
          ultimately from the very existence of it. Salvation is the death of
          sin, its burial, its annihilation, yea, and the very obliteration of
          its memory; for thus saith the Lord: |their sins and their iniquities
          will I remember no more.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved hearers, I am sure that this is the weightiest theme I can
          bring before you and therefore I cannot be content unless I see that
          it grasps you and holds you fast. I pray you give earnest heed to this
          most pressing of all subjects. If my voice and words cannot command
          your fullest attention, I could wish to be dumb, that some other
          pleader might with wiser speech draw you to a close consideration of
          this matter. Salvation appears to me to be of the first importance,
          when I think of what it is in itself, and for this reason I have at
          the outset set it forth before your eyes; but you may be helped to
          remember its value if you consider that God the Father thinks highly
          of salvation. It was on his mind or ever the earth was. He thinks
          salvation a lofty business, for he gave his Son that he might save
          rebellious sinners. Jesus Christ, the only Begotten, thinks salvation
          most important, for he bled, he died to accomplish it. Shall I bide
          with that which cost him his life? If he came from heaven to earth,
          shall I be slow to look from earth to heaven? Shall that which cost
          the Savior a life of zeal, and a death of agony, be of small account
          with me? By the bloody sweat of Gethsemane, by the wounds of Calvary,
          I beseech you, be assured that salvation must be worthy of your
          highest and most anxious thoughts. It could not be that God the
          Father, and God the Son, should thus make a common sacrifice: the one
          giving his Son and the other giving himself for salvation, and yet
          salvation should be a light and trivial thing. The Holy Ghost thinks
          it no trifle, for he condescends to work continually in the new
          creation that he may bring about salvation. He is often vexed and
          grieved, yet he continues still his abiding labors that he may bring
          many sons unto glory. Despise not what the Holy Ghost esteems, lest
          thou despise the Holy Ghost himself. The sacred Trinity think much of
          salvation; let us not neglect it. I beseech you who have gone on
          trifling with salvation, to remember that we who have to preach to you
          dare not trifle with it. The longer I live the more I feel that if God
          do not make me faithful as a minister, it had been better for me never
          to have been bow. What a thought that I am set as a watchman to warn
          your souls, and if I warn you not aright, your blood will be laid at
          my door! My own damnation will be terrible enough, but to have your
          blood upon my skirts as well -- ! God save any one of his ministers
          from being found guilty of the souls of men. Every preacher of the
          gospel may cry with David, |Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
          thou God of my salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Bethink you, O careless hearers, that God's church does not consider
          salvation to be a little matter? Earnest men and women, by thousands,
          are praying day and night for the salvation of others, and are
          laboring too, and making great sacrifices, and are willing to make
          many more, if they may by any means bring some to Jesus and his
          salvation. Surely, if gracious men, and wise men, think salvation to
          be so important, you who have hitherto neglected it ought to change
          your minds upon the matter, and act with greater care for your own
          interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels think it a weighty business. Bowing from their thrones,
          they watch for repenting sinners; and when they hear that a sinner has
          returned to his God, they waken anew their golden harps and pour forth
          fresh music before the throne, for |there is joy in the presence of
          the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.| It is certain also
          that devils think salvation to be a great matter, for their
          arch-leader goeth about seeking whom he may devour. They never tire in
          seeking men's destruction. They know how much salvation glorifies God,
          and how terrible the ruin of souls is; and therefore they compass sea
          and land, if they may destroy the sons of men. Oh, I pray you,
          careless hearer, be wise enough to dread that fate which your cruel
          enemy, the devil, would fain secure for you! Remember, too, that lost
          souls think salvation important. The rich man, when he was in this
          world, thought highly of nothing but his barns, and the housing of his
          produce; but when he came into the place of torment, then he said:
          |Father Abraham, send Lazarus to my father's house: for I have five
          brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also they come into
          this place of torment.| Lost souls see things in another light than
          that which dazzled them here below; they value things at a different
          rate from what we do here, where sinful pleasures and earthly
          treasures dim the mental eye. I pray you then, by the blessed Trinity,
          by the tears and prayers of holy men, by the joy of angels and
          glorified spirits, by the malice of devils and the despair of the
          lost, arouse yourselves from slumber, and neglect not this great
          salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not depreciate anything that concerns your welfare, but I
          shall steadfastly assert that nothing so much concerns any one of you
          as salvation. Your health by all means. Let the physician be fetched
          if you be sick; care well for diet and exercise, and all sanitary
          laws. Look wisely to your constitution and its peculiarities; but what
          matters it, after all, to have possessed a healthy body, if you have a
          perishing soul? Wealth, yes, if you must have it, though you shall
          find it an empty thing if you set your heart upon it. Prosperity in
          this world, earn it if you can do so fairly, but |what shall it profit
          a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?| A
          golden coffin will be a poor compensation for a damned soul. To be
          cast away from God's presence, can that misery be assuaged by
          mountains of treasure? Can the bitterness of the second death be
          sweetened by the thought that the wretch was once a millionaire, and
          that his wealth could affect the polities of nations? No, there is
          nothing in health or wealth comparable to salvation. Nor can honor and
          reputation bear a comparison therewith. Truly they are but baubles,
          and yet for all that they have a strange fascination for the soul of
          men. Oh, sirs, if every harpstring in the world should resound your
          glories, and every trumpet should proclaim your fame, what would it
          matter if a louder voice should say, |Depart from me, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels|? Salvation!
          salvation! SALVATION! Nothing on earth can match it, for the
          merchandise of it is better than silver, and the gain thereof than
          fine gold. The possession of the whole universe would be no equivalent
          to a lost soul for the awful damage it has sustained and must sustain
          for ever. Pile up the worlds, and let them fill the balance: ay, bring
          as many worlds as there are stars, and heap up the scale on the one
          side; then in this other scale place a single soul endowed with
          immortality, and it outweighs the whole. Salvation! nothing can be
          likened unto it. May we feel its unutterable value, and therefore seek
          it till we possess it in its fullness!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now we must advance to a second point of consideration, and I
          pray God the Holy Spirit to press it upon us, and that is, WHOSE
          MATTER IS IT? We have seen what the matter is -- salvation; now,
          consider whose is it. |Your own salvation.| At this hour nothing else
          is to occupy your thoughts but this intensely personal matter, and I
          beseech the Holy Spirit to hold your minds fast to this one point.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are saved it will be |your own salvation,| end you yourself
          will enjoy it. If you are not saved, the sin you now commit is your
          own sin, the guilt your own guilt. The condemnation under which you
          fire, with all its disquietude and fear, or with all its callousnees
          and neglect is your own -- all your own you may share in other men's
          sins, and other men may become participators in yours, but a burden
          lies on your own back which no one besides can touch with one of his
          fingers. There; is a page in God's Book where your sins are recorded
          unmingled with the transgressions of your fellows. Now, beloved, you
          must obtain for all this sin a personal pardon, or you are undone for
          ever. No other can be washed in Christ's blood for you; no one can
          believe and let his faith stand instead of your faith. The very
          supposition of human sponsorship in religion is monstrous. You must
          yourself repent, yourself believe, yourself be washed in the blood, or
          else for you there is no forgiveness, no acceptance, no adoption, no
          regeneration. It is all a personal matter through and through: |your
          own salvation| it must be, or it will be your own eternal ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflect anxiously that you must personally die. No one imagines that
          another can die for him. No man can redeem his brother or give to God
          a ransom. Through that iron gate I must pass alone, and so must you.
          Dying will have to be our own personal business; and in that dying we
          shall have either personal comfort or personal dismay. When death is
          past, salvation is still our |own salvation;| for if I am saved, mine
          |eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land
          that is very far off.| Mine eyes shall see him, and not another on my
          behalf. No brother's head is to wear your crown; no stranger's hand to
          wave your palm; no sister's eye to gaze for you upon the beatific
          vision, and no sponsor's heart to be filled as your proxy with the
          ecstatic bliss. There is a personal heaven for the personal believer
          in the Lord Jesus Christ. It must be if you possess it, |your own
          salvation.| But if you have it not, reflect again, that it will be
          your own damnation. No one will be condemned for you; no other can
          bear the hot thunder bolts of Jehovah's wrath on your behalf. When you
          shall say, |Hide me, ye rocks! Conceal me, O mountains!| No one will
          spring forward, and say, |You can cease to be accursed, and I will
          become a curse for you.| A substitute there is to-day for every one
          that believeth -- God's appointed substitute, the Christ of God; but
          if that substitution be not accepted by you, there can never be
          another; but there remains only for you a personal casting away to
          suffer personal pangs in your own soul and in your own body for ever.
          This, then, makes it a most solemn business. O be wise, and look well
          to |your own salvation.|
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be tempted to-day, and very likely you are to forget your own
          salvation by thoughts of other people. We are all so apt to look
          abroad in this matter, and not to look at home. Let me pray you to
          reverse the process, and let everything which has made you neglect
          your own vineyard be turned to the opposite account, and lead you to
          begin at home, and see to |your own salvation.| Perhaps you dwell
          among the saints of God, and you have been rather apt to find fault
          with them, though for my part, I can say these are the people I desire
          to live with and desire to die with: |thy people shall be my people,
          and thy God my God.| But, O if you live among the saints ought it not
          to be your business to see to |Your own salvation|? See that you are
          truly one of them, not written in their church-book merely, but really
          graven upon the palms of Christ's hands; not a false professor, but a
          real possessor; not a mere wearer of the name of Christ, but a bearer
          of the nature of Christ. If you live in a gracious family be afraid
          lest thou should be divided from them for ever. How could you endure
          to go from a Christian household to the place of torment! Let the
          anxieties of saints lead you to be anxious. Let their prayers drive
          you to prayer. Let their example rebuke your sin, and their joys
          entice you to their Savior. O see to this! But perhaps you live most
          among ungodly men, and the tendency of your converse with the ungodly
          is to make you think as they do of the trifles and vanities, and
          wickednesses of this life. Do not let it be so; but, on the contrary,
          say, |O God, though I am placed among these people, yet gather not my
          soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men. Let me avoid the sins
          into which they fall, and the impenitence of which they are guilty.
          Save me, I pray thee, O my God, save me from the transgressions which
          they commit.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps to-day some of your minds are occupied with thoughts of the
          dead who have lately fallen asleep. There is a little one unburied at
          home, or there is a father not get laid in the grave. Oh, when you
          weep for those who have gone to heaven, think of |your own salvation,|
          and weep for yourselves, for you have parted with them for ever unless
          you are saved. You have said, |Farewell| to those beloved ones,
          eternally farewell, unless you yourselves believe in Jesus. And if any
          of you have heard of persons who have lived in sin and died in
          blasphemy, and are lost, I pray you think not of them carelessly lest
          you also suffer the same doom: for what saith the Savior: |Suppose ye
          that these were sinners above all the sinners?| |I tell you, Nay: but,
          except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.| It seems to me as if
          everything on earth and everything in heaven, and everything in hell,
          yea, and God himself, calls upon you to seek |your own salvation,|
          first, and foremost, and above all other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be profitable to mention some persons upon whom this theme
          needs much pressing. I will begin at home. There is great need to urge
          this matter upon official Christians, such as I am, such as my
          brethren, the deacons and elders, are. If there are any persons who
          are likely to be deceived, it is those who are called by their office
          to act as shepherds to the souls of others. Oh, my brethren I it is so
          easy for me to imagine because I am a minister, and have to deal with
          holy things, that therefore I am safe. I pray I may never fall into
          that delusion, but may always cling to the cross, as a poor, needy
          sinner resting in the blood of Jesus. Brother ministers, co-workers,
          and officials of the church, do not imagine that office can save you.
          The son of perdition was an apostle, greater than we are in office,
          and yet at this hour he is greater in destruction. See to it, ye that
          are numbered amongst the leaders of Israel, that you yourselves be
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unpractical doctrinalists are another class of persons who need to be
          warned to see to their own salvation. When they hear a sermon, they
          sit with their mouths open, ready to snap at half a mistake. They make
          a man an offender for a word, for they conclude themselves to be the
          standards of orthodoxy, and they weigh up the preacher as he speaks,
          with as much coolness as if they had been appointed deputy judges for
          the Great King himself. Oh, sir, weigh yourself! It may be a great
          thing to be sound in the head, in the faith, but it is a greater thing
          to be sound in the heart. I may be able to split a hair between
          orthodoxy and heterodoxy, and yet may have no part nor lot in the
          matter. You may be a very sound Calvinist, or you may happen to think
          soundness lies in another direction; but, oh, it is nought, it is less
          than nought, except your souls feel the power of the truth, and ye
          yourselves are born again. See to |your own salvation,| O ye wise men
          in the letter, who have not the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, certain persons who are always given to curious speculations
          need warning. When they read the Bible it is not to find whether they
          are saved or no, but to know whether we are under the third or fourth
          vial, when the millenium is going to be, or what is the battle of
          Armageddon. Ah, sir, search out all these things if thou hast time and
          skill, but look to thine own salvation first. The book of Revelation,
          blessed is he that understands it, but not unless, first of all, he
          understands this, |He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved.|
          The greatest doctor in the symbols and mysteries of the Apocalypse
          shall be as certainly cast away as the most ignorant, unless he has
          come to Christ, and rested his soul in the atoning work of our great
          substitute.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know some who greatly need to look to their own salvation. I refer
          to those who are always criticising others. They can hardly go to a
          place of worship but what they are observing their neighbour's dress
          or conduct. Nobody is safe from their remarks, they are such keen
          judges, and make such shrewd observations. Ye faultfinders and
          talebearers, look to |your own salvation.| You condemned a minister
          the other day for a supposed fault, and yet he is a dear servant of
          God, who lives near his Master; who are you, sir, to use your tongue
          against such a one as he? The other day a poor humble Christian was
          the object of your gossip and your slander, to the wounding of her
          heart. Oh, see to yourself, see to yourself. If those eyes which look
          outward so piercingly would sometimes look inward they might see a
          sight which would blind them with horror. Blessed horror if it led
          them to turn to the Savior who would open those eyes afresh, and grant
          them to see his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I might also say that in this matter of looking to personal salvation,
          it is necessary to speak to some who have espoused certain great
          public designs. I trust I am as ardent a Protestant as any man living,
          but I know too many red-hot Protestants who are but little better than
          Romanists, for though the Romanists of old might have burnt them, they
          would certainly withhold toleration from Romanists to-day, if they
          could; and therein I see not a pin to choose between the two bigots.
          Zealous Protestants, I agree with you, but yet I warn you that your
          zeal in this matter will not save you, or stand in the stead of
          personal godliness. Many an orthodox Protestant will be found at the
          left hand of the Great Judge. And you, too, who are for ever agitating
          this and that public question, I would say to you, |Let politics alone
          till your own inward politics are settled on a good foundation.| You
          are a Radical Reformer, you could show us a system of political
          economy which would right all our wrongs and give to every man his
          due; then I pray you right you own wrongs, reform yourself, yield
          yourself to the love of Jesus Christ, or what will it signify to you,
          though you knew how to balance the affairs of nations, and to regulate
          the arrangement of all classes of society, if you yourself shall be
          blown away like chaff before the winnowing fan of the Lord. God grant
          us grace, then, whatever else we take up with, to keep it in its
          proper place, and make our calling and election sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, thirdly, and O for grace to speak aright, I shall try to
          ANSWER CERTAIN OBJECTIONS. I think I hear somebody say, |Well, but
          don't you believe in predestination? What have we to do with looking
          to our own salvation? Is it not all fixed?| Thou fool, for I can
          scarce answer thee till I have given thee thy right title; was it not
          fixed whether thou shouldst get wet or not in coming to this place?
          Why then did you bring your umbrella? Is it not fixed whether you
          shall be nourished with food to-day or shall go hungry? Why then will
          you go home and eat your dinner? Is it not fixed whether you shall
          live or not to-morrow; will you therefore, cut your throat? No, you do
          not reason so wickedly, so foolishly from destiny in reference to
          anything but |your own salvation,| and you know it is not reasoning,
          it just mere talk. Here is all the answer I will give you, and all you
          deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another says, |I have a difficulty about this looking to our own
          salvation. Do you not believe in full assurance? Are there not some
          who know that they are saved beyond all doubt? Yes, blessed be God, I
          hope there are many such now present. But let me tell you who these
          are not. These are not persons who are afraid to examine themselves.
          If I meet with any man who says, |I have no need to examine my self
          any more, I know I am saved, and therefore have no need to take any
          further care,| I would venture to say to him, |Sir, you are lost
          already. This strong delusion of yours has led you to believe a lie.|
          There are none so cautious as those who possess full assurance, and
          there are none who have so much holy fear of sinning against God, nor
          who walk so tenderly and carefully as those who possess the full
          assurance of faith. Presumption is not assurance, though, alas! many
          think so. No fully assured believer will ever object to being reminded
          of the importance of his own salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a third objection arises. |This is very selfish,| says one. |You
          have been exhorting us to look to ourselves, and that is sheer
          selfishness.| Yes, so you say; but let me tell you it is a kind of
          selfishness that is absolutely needful before you can be unselfish. A
          part of salvation is to be delivered from selfishness, and I am
          selfish enough to desire to be delivered from selfishness. How can you
          be of any service to others if you are not saved yourself? A man is
          drowning. I am on London Bridge. If I spring from the parapet and can
          swim, I can save him; but suppose I cannot swim, can I render any
          service by leaping into sudden and certain death with the sinking man?
          I am disqualified from helping him till I have the ability to do so.
          There is a school over yonder. Well, the first enquiry of him who is
          to be the master must he, |Do I know myself that which I profess to
          teach?| Do you call that enquiry selfish? Surely it a most unselfish
          selfishness, grounded upon common sense. Indeed, the man who is not so
          selfish as to ask himself, |Am I qualified to act as a teacher?| would
          be guilty of gross selfishness in putting himself into an office which
          he was not qualified to fill. I will suppose an illiterate person
          going into the school, and saying, |I will be master here, and take
          the pay,| and yet he cannot teach the children to read or write. Would
          he not be very selfish in not seeing to his own fitness? But surely it
          it is not selfishness that would make a man stand back and say, |No, I
          must first go to school myself, otherwise it is but a mockery of the
          children for me to attempt to teach them anything.| This is no
          selfishness, then, when looked at aright, which makes us see to our
          own salvation, for it is the basis from which we operate for the good
          of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Having answered these objections, I shall for a minute attempt to
          RENDER SOME ASSISTANCE to those who would fain be right in the best
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Has the Holy Spirit been pleased to make any one here earnest about
          his own salvation? Friend, I will help you to answer two questions.
          Ask yourself, first, |Am I saved?| I would help thee to reply to that
          very quickly. If you are saved this morning, you are the subject of a
          work within you, as saith the text, |Work out your own salvation; for
          it is God which worketh in you.| you cannot work it in, but when God
          works it in you work it out. Have you a work of the Holy Ghost in your
          soul? Do you feel something more than unaided human nature can attain
          unto? Have you a change wrought in you from above? If so, you are
          saved. Again, does your salvation rest wholly upon Christ? He who
          hangs anywhere but upon the cross, hangs upon that which will deceive
          him. If thou standest upon Christ, thou art on a rock; but if thou
          trustest in the merits of Christ in part, and thy own merits in part,
          then thou hast one foot on a rock but another on the quicksand; and
          thou mightest as well have both feet on the quicksand, for the result
          will be the same.
        </p>
        <p>|None but Jesus, none but Jesus</p>
        <p>Can do helpless sinners good.|</p>
        <p>
          Thou art not saved unless Christ be all in all in thy soul, Alpha and
          Omega, beginning and ending, first and last. Judge by this, again: if
          you are saved, you have turned your back on sin. You have not left off
          sinning -- would to God we could do so -- but you have left off loving
          sin; you sin not wilfully, but from infirmity; and you are earnestly
          seeking after God and holiness. You have respect to God, you desire to
          be like him, you are longing to be with him. Your face is towards
          heaven. You are as a man who journeys to the Equator. You are feeling
          more and more the warm influence of the heavenly heat and light. Now,
          if such be your course of life, that you walk not after the flesh, but
          after the Spirit, and bring forth the fruits of holiness, then you are
          saved. May your answer to that question he given in great honesty and
          candour to your own soul. Be not too partial a Judge. Conclude not
          that all is right because outward appearances are fair. Deliberate
          before you return a favorable verdict. Judge yourselves that ye be not
          judged. It were better to condemn yourself and be accepted of God,
          than to acquit yourself and find your mistake at the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          But suppose that question should have to be answered by any here in
          the negative (and I am afraid it must be), then let those who confess
          that they are not saved, hear the answer to another enquiry: |How can
          I be saved?| Ah, dear hearer, I have not to bring a huge volume nor a
          whole armful of folios to you, and to say, |It will take you months
          and Years to understand the plan of salvation.| No, the way is plain,
          the method simple. Thou shalt be saved within the next moment if thou
          believest. God's work of salvation is, as far as its commencement and
          essence is concerned, instantaneous. If thou believes |that Jesus is
          the Christ, thou art born of God now. If thou dost now stand in spirit
          at the foot of the cross, and view the incarnate God suffering,
          bleeding, and dying there, and if as thou dost look at him, thy soul
          consents to have him for her Savior, and casts herself wholly on him,
          thou art saved. How vividly there comes before my memory this morning
          the moment when I first believed in Jesus! It was the simplest act my
          mind every performed, and yet the most wonderful, for the Holy Spirit
          wrought it in me. Simply to have done with reliance upon myself, and
          have done with confidence in all but Jesus, and to rest alone, my
          undivided confidence in him, and in what he had done. My sin was in
          that moment forgiven me, and I was saved, and may it all be so with
          you, my friend, even with you if you also, trust the Lord Jesus. |Your
          own salvation| shall be secured by that one simple act of faith; and
          henceforward, kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation,
          you shall tread the way of holiness, till you come to be where Jesus
          is in everlasting bliss. God grant that not a soul may go out of this
          place unsaved. Even you, little children, who are here, you
          youngsters, you young boys and girls, I pray that you may in early
          life attend to |your own salvation.| Faith is not a grace for old
          people only, nor for your fathers and mothers only; if your little
          hearts shall look to him who was the holy child Jesus, if you know but
          little yet, if you trust him salvation shall be yours. I pray that to
          you who are young, |your own salvation| may become, while you are yet
          in your youth, a matter of joy, because you have trusted it in the
          hands of your Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I must close: but one or two thoughts press me. I must utter them
          ere I sit down. I would anxiously urge each person here to see to this
          matter of his own salvation. Do it, I pray you, and in earnest, for no
          one can do it for you. I have asked God for your soul, my hearer, and
          I pray I may have an answer of peace concerning you. But unless you
          also pray, vain are my prayers. You remember your mother's tears. Ah!
          you have crossed the ocean since those days, and you have gone into
          the deeps of sin, but you recollect when you used to say your prayers
          at her knee, and when she would lovingly say |Amen,| and kiss her boy
          and bless him, and pray that he might know his mother's God. Those
          prayers are ringing in the ears of God for you, but it is impossible
          that you can ever be saved unless it is said of you, |Behold, he
          prayeth.| Your mother's holiness can only rise up in judgment to
          condemn your wilful wickedness unless you imitate it. Your father's
          earnest exhortations shall but confirm the just sentence of the Judge
          unless you hearken to them, and yourselves consider and put your trust
          in Jesus. Oh I bethink you each one of you, there is but one hope, and
          that one hope lost, it is gone for ever. Defeated in one battle, a
          commander attempts another, and hopes that he may yet win the
          campaign. Your life is your one fight, and if it be lost it is lost
          for aye. The man who was bankrupt yesterday commences again in
          business with good heart, and hopes that he may yet succeed; but in
          the business of this mortal life, if you are found bankrupt, you are
          bankrupt for ever and ever. I do therefore charge you by the living
          God, before whom I stand, and before whom I may have to give an
          account of this day's preaching ere another day's sun shall shine, I
          charge you see to your own salvation. God help you, that you may never
          cease to seek unto God till you know by the witness of the Spirit that
          you have indeed passed from death unto life. See to it now, now, NOW,
          NOW. This very day the voice of warning comes to certain of you from
          God, with special emphasis, because you greatly need it, for your time
          is short. How many have passed into eternity during this week! You may
          yourself be gone from the land of the living before next Sabbath-day.
          I suppose, according to the calculation of probabilities, out of this
          audience there are several who will die within a month. I am not
          conjecturing now, but according to all probabilities these thousands
          cannot all meet again, it all have a mind to do so. Who then among us
          will be summoned to the unknown land? Will it be you, young woman, who
          have been laughing at the things of God? Shall it be yonder merchant,
          who has not time enough for religion? Shall it be you, my foreign
          friend, who have crossed the ocean to take a holiday? Will you be
          carried back a corpse? I do conjure you bethink yourselves, all of
          you. You who dwell in London will remember years ago when the cholera
          swept through our streets, some of us were in the midst of it, and saw
          many drop around us, as though smitten with an invisible but deadly
          arrow. That disease is said to be on its way hither again; it is said
          to be rapidly sweeping from Poland across the Continent, and if it
          come and seize some of you, are you ready to depart? Even if that form
          of death do not afflict our city, as I pray it may not, yet is death
          ever within our gates, and the pestilence walketh in darkness every
          night, therefore consider your ways. Thus saith the Lord, and with his
          word I conclude this discourse: |Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.|
