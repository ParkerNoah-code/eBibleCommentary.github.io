          How, you ask, is Jesus, Who is beyond all, ranked essentially with all
          men? For, not as Author of men is He here called man, but as being in
          absolute whole essence truly man. But we do not define the Lord Jesus,
          humanly, for He is not man only, (neither superessential nor man
          only), but truly man, He Who is pre-eminently a lover of man, the
          Super-essential, taking substance, above men and after men, from the
          substance of men. And it is nothing less, the ever Superessential,
          super-full of super-essentiality, disregards the excess of this, and
          having come truly into substance, took substance above substance, and
          above man works things of man. And a virgin supernaturally conceiving,
          and unstable water, holding up weight of material and earthly feet,
          and not giving way, but, by a supernatural power standing together so
          as not to be divided, demonstrate this. Why should any one go through
          the rest, which are very many? Through which, he who looks with a
          divine vision, will know beyond mind, even the things affirmed
          respecting the love towards man, of (the Lord) Jesus, -- things which
          possess a force of superlative negation. For, even, to speak
          summarily, He was not man, not as not being man, but as being from men
          was beyond men, and was above man, having truly been born man, and for
          the rest, not having done things Divine as God, nor things human as
          man, but exercising for us a certain new God-incarnate energy of God
          having become man.<br />
