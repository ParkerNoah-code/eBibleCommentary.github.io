        <p>THE GREAT ARRAIGNMENT</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: I
          have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel
          doth not know, my people doth not consider. Ah sinful nation, a people
          laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal
          corruptly: they have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy
          One of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward. Why will ye be
          still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The whole head is sick,
          and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the
          head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and
          festering sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
          mollified with oil. Your country is desolate; your cities are burned
          with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
          desolate, as overthrown by strangers. And the daughter of Zion is left
          as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a
          besieged city. Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
          remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto
          Gomorrah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law
          of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. To what purpose is the multitude of
          your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt
          offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the
          blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. When ye come to appear
          before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
          Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new
          moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, -- I cannot away with
          iniquity and the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed
          feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear
          them. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
          you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are
          full of blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before
          mine eyes; cease to do evil: learn to do well; seek judgement, relieve
          the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now,
          and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as
          scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
          crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye
          shall eat the good of the land: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall
          be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is the faithful city become an harlot! she that was full of
          judgement! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. Thy silver
          is become dross, thy wine mixed with water. Thy princes are
          rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and
          followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth
          the cause of the widow come unto them. Therefore saith the Lord, the
          LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine
          adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: and I will turn my hand
          upon thee, and throughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all
          thy alloy: and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
          counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The
          city of righteousness, the faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with
          judgement, and her converts with righteousness. But the destruction of
          the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that
          forsake the LORD shall be consumed. For they shall be ashamed of the
          oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens
          that ye have chosen. For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and
          as a garden that hath no water. And the strong shall be as tow, and
          his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall
          quench them.
