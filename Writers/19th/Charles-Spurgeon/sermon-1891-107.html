          1. Wherefore also John does appropriately relate that the Lord said to
          the Jews: |Ye search the Scriptures, in which ye think ye have eternal
          life; these are they which testify of me. And ye are not willing to
          come unto Me, that ye may have life.| How therefore did the Scriptures
          testify of Him, unless they were from one and the same Father,
          instructing men beforehand as to the advent of His Son, and
          foretelling the salvation brought in by Him? |For if ye had believed
          Moses, ye would also have believed Me; for he wrote of Me;| [saying
          this,] no doubt, because the Son of God is implanted everywhere
          throughout his writings: at one time, indeed, speaking with Abraham,
          when about to eat with him; at another time with Noah, giving to him
          the dimensions [of the ark]; at another; inquiring after Adam; at
          another, bringing down judgment upon the Sodomites; and again, when He
          becomes visible, and directs Jacob on his journey, and speaks with
          Moses from the bush. And it would be endless to recount [the
          occasions] upon which the Son of God is shown forth by Moses. Of the
          day of His passion, too, he was not ignorant; but foretold Him, after
          a figurative manner, by the name given to the passover; and at that
          very festival, which had been proclaimed such a long time previously
          by Moses, did our Lord suffer, thus fulfilling the passover. And he
          did not describe the day only, but the place also, and the time of day
          at which the sufferings ceased, and the sign of the setting of the
          sun, saying: |Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any other
          of thy cities which the Lord God gives thee; but in the place which
          the Lord thy God shall choose that His name be called on there, thou
          shalt sacrifice the passover at even, towards the setting of the sun.|
        </p>

          2. And already he had also declared His advent, saying, |There shall
          not fail a chief in Judah, nor a leader from his loins, until He come
          for whom it is laid up, and He is the hope of the nations; binding His
          foal to the vine, and His ass's colt to the creeping ivy. He shall
          wash His stole in wine, and His upper garment in the blood of the
          grape; His eyes shall be more joyous than wine, and His teeth whiter
          than milk.| For, let those who have the reputation of investigating
          everything, inquire at what time a prince and leader failed out of
          Judah, and who is the hope of the nations, who also is the vine, what
          was the ass's colt [referred to as] His, what the clothing, and what
          the eyes, what the teeth, and what the wine, and thus let them
          investigate every one of the points mentioned; and they shall find
          that there was none other announced than our Lord, Christ Jesus.
          Wherefore Moses, when chiding the ingratitude of the people, said, |Ye
          infatuated people, and unwise, do ye thus requite the Lord?| And
          again, he indicates that He who from the beginning founded and created
          them, the Word, who also redeems and vivifies us in the last times, is
          shown as hanging on the tree, and they will not believe on Him. For he
          says, |And thy life shall be hanging before thine eyes, and thou wilt
          not believe thy life.| And again, |Has not this same one thy Father
          owned thee, and made thee, and created thee?|
