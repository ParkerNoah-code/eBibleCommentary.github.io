        <p>A Sermon for the Lancashire Distress</p>
        <p>(No.479)</p>

          |Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved
          for the poor?| -- Job 30:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN ENDEAVORING TO JUSTIFY the ways of God, Job's three friends came to
          the harsh conclusion that he would not have been so severely afflicted
          if he had not been a very great sinner. Among other accusations
          against the afflicted patriarch, Eliphaz the Temanite had the cruelty
          to lay this at his door, |Thou hast not given water to the weary to
          drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.| Such a slander
          we may describe as |speaking wickedly for God,| for in his ignorance
          of the great laws of Providence towards the saints in this life, the
          Temanite had uttered falsehood in order to account for the divine
          procedure. God's own testimony of Job is that he was |a perfect and an
          upright man, one that feared God and eschewed evil;| and certainly he
          could never have earned the character of |perfect| if he had been
          devoid of pity for the poor. Richly did the three miserable comforters
          deserve the burning rebuke of their slandered friend, |Ye are forgers
          of lies, ye are physicians of no value. O that ye would altogether
          hold your peace and it shall be your wisdom.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Job, in his great indignation at the shameful accusation of unkindness
          to the needy, pours forth the following very solemn imprecation -- |If
          I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of
          the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the
          fatherless hath not eaten thereof; if I have seen any perish for want
          of clothing, or any poor without covering; if his loins have not
          blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; if
          I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in
          the gate: then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm
          be broken from the bone.| Thus vehemently making a tremendous appeal
          to heaven, he shakes off the slander into the fire as Paul shook the
          viper from his hand. I trust there are many present who, if the like
          charge should be laid to their door, might as boldly deny it; not in
          the same form of imprecation, for that is forbidden to the Christian
          man, but with all the positiveness which can dwell in the |Yea, yea,
          |Nay, nay| of the followers of Jesus. I trust that many of you can in
          your measure use the language of the man of Uz, and say, |When the ear
          heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness
          to me: because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
          and him that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready
          to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for
          joy.| In the two questions of my text Job claims something more than
          merely having helped the poor with gifts, he declares that he wept and
          grieved for them. His charity was of the heart. He considered their
          case; laid their sorrows to his own soul, and lent his eyes to weep
          and his heart to mourn. |Did I not weep for him that was in trouble?
          Was not my soul grieved for the poor?| Human sympathy is the subject
          of our present meditation, and I shall labor to excite in you those
          emotions which are the genuine result of sympathy when it is truly
          felt. Practical sympathy is my aim; I trust your liberality, at the
          end of the sermon, will prove that I have hit the center of my target.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human sympathy, then, its commendations, its hindrances, its sure
          fruits, and its special application to the case in hand this morning.
        </p>
        <p>I. HUMAN SYMPATHY, ITS COMMENDATIONS.</p>
        <p>
          1. We may say of it, first, that even nature dictateth that man should
          feel a sympathy for his kind. Humanity, had it remained in its
          unfallen estate would have been one delightful household of brothers
          and sisters. If our first parents had never sinned, we should have
          been one unbroken family, the home of peace, the abode of love. The
          fact that |God hath made of one blood all nations that dwell upon the
          face of the earth| would then have been a realized and established
          truth; no nationalities would have divided, or personal interests
          separated us. Having one common Father, one loving God, one blissful
          Paradise, our lives would have been one long heaven on earth of
          sweetly intermingled peace, love, joy, fellowship, and purity. One can
          hardly indulge a conception of such a happy world without an intense
          regret that the fall has made it all a dream -- yet let us dream a
          moment of a world without a soldier, without sword, or spear, or
          shield; a world without a prison, a magistrate, or a chain; a society
          in which none will wrong his fellow, but each is anxious for the
          well-being of all; a race needing no exhortation to virtue, for virtue
          is its very life; a land where love has knit all natures into unity
          and breathed one soul into a thousand bodies! Alas! for us, when Adam
          fell he not only violated his Maker's laws, but in the fill he broke
          the unity of the race, and now we are isolated particles of manhood,
          instead of being what we should have been, members of one body, moved
          by one and the same spirit. The dream may vanish but we lose not our
          argument, for even in fallen humanity there are some palpitations of
          the one heart, some signs of the |one blood.| Flesh and blood are able
          to make the revelation that we were not made to live unto ourselves.
          Fallen and debased as man is, and this pulpit is not prone to flatter
          human nature, yet we cannot; but recognize the generous feeling
          towards the poor and suffering which exists in many an unregenerate
          heart. We have known men who have forgotten God, but who,
          nevertheless, do not forget the poor; who despise their Maker's laws,
          but yet have a heart that melts at a tale of woe. It were folly to
          dispute that some who deny the God that made them, have yet exhibited
          bowels of compassion to the poor and needy. When even publicans and
          harlots can exhibit sympathy, how much more should it burn in the
          Christian heart; we should do more than others or else we shall hear
          the Master say, |What thank have ye? for sinners also do even the
          same.| Called with a nobler calling, let us exhibit as the result of
          our regenerate nature a loftier compassion for the suffering sons of
          men. Many interesting incidents have been recorded by naturalists of
          sympathy among animals; the |dumb driven cattle| of our pastures, and
          the dogs of our streets have manifested commiseration towards a
          suffering one of their own species; and we are less than men, we are
          worse than brute beasts if we can enjoy abundance without sharing our
          bread with the starving, if we can be wrapt in comfort and refuse a
          garment to the shivering poor, or rest in our ceiled houses and yield
          no shelter to the homeless wanderer. Brethren, if nature herself
          teaches you wherefore should I say more, ye are not unnatural, ye
          achieve already more than mere nature can demand; you do the greater,
          you will not fail in the less.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Further, we may remark that the absence of sympathy has always been
          esteemed, in all countries, and in all ayes, one of the most
          abominable of vices. In old classic history who are the men held up to
          everlasting execration? Are they not those who had no mercy on the
          poor. Each land has its legend of the proud noble who hoarded up his
          corn in the day of famine, and bade the perishing multitudes curse and
          die; and down to this day the name of such a wretch is quoted as a
          word of infamy. A man without a heart would be a beast more worthy of
          being hunted down than a tiger or a wolf. Men with little hearts and
          grasping ungenerous spirits, how heartily are they despised! If they
          wear the Christian garb they disgrace it; the ordinary disciples of
          morality are ashamed of them, and I may add that even vice and
          immorality shun their company. The grinding, hardhearted man may gain
          the approbation of those who are like himself, and therefore applaud
          him for his prudence and discretion, but the big heart of the world
          has ever been sound enough on this matter to understand that there is
          no genuine virtue without liberality, and that one of the most damning
          of all vices which stamps a man as being thoroughly rotten at the
          core, is that vice of selfishness which makes the wretch live and care
          only for his own personal aggrandizement, and offer only a stony heart
          to the woes of his fellows. Brethren, I entertain no fear that you
          will ever win the badge of infamy which hangs about the neck of
          churls.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But I have better arguments to use with you. Sympathy is especially
          a Christian's duty. Consider what the Christian is, and you will say
          that if every other man were selfish he should be disinterested; if
          there were nowhere else a heart that had sympathy for the needy there
          should be one found in every Christian breast. The Christian is a
          king; it becometh not a king to be meanly caring for himself. Was
          Alexander ever more royal than when his troops were suffering from
          thirst, and a soldier offered him a bowl full of the precious liquid,
          he put it aside, and said it was not fitting for a king to drink while
          his subjects were thirsty, and that he would share the sorrow with
          them? O ye; whom God has made kings and princes, reign royally over
          your own selfishness, and act with the honorable liberality which
          becomes the seed royal of the universe. You are sent into the world to
          be saviours of others, but how shall you be so if you care only for
          yourselves? It is yours to be lights, and doth not a light consume
          itself while it scatters its rays into the thick darkness? Is it not
          your office and privilege to have it said of you as of your Master --
          |He saved others, himself he cannot save?| The Christian's sympathy
          should ever be of the widest character, because he serves a God of
          infinite love. When the precious stone of love is thrown by grace into
          the crystal pool of a renewed heart it stirs the transparent life
          floods into ever widening circles of sympathy: the first ring has no
          very wide circumference; we love our own household; for he that careth
          not for his own household is worse than a heathen man and a publican:
          but mark the next concentric ring; we love the household of faith. We
          know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the
          brethren:| look once more, for the ever-widening ring has reached the
          very limit of the lake, and included all men in its area, for
          |supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks are to be
          made for all men.|
        </p>
        <p>
          If any man shall think that we are not |born for the universe| and
          should narrow our souls, I can only say that I have not so learned
          Christ, and hope never to confine to a few the sympathy which I
          believe to be meant for mankind. To me, a follower of Jesus means a
          friend of man. A Christian is a philanthrophist by profession, and
          generous by force of grace; wide as the reign of sorrow is the stretch
          of his love, and where he cannot help he pities still.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Beloved, will you remember the blessed example of our Lord and
          Savior Jesus Christ; for this, surely, will teach you not to live for
          self. |For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
          was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his
          poverty might be rich.| His heart is made of tenderness, his bowels
          melt with love. In all our afflictions he is afflicted. Since the day
          when he became flesh of our flesh, he hath never hidden himself from
          our sufferings. Our glorious Head is moved with all the sorrows which
          distress the members. Crowned though he now be, he forgets not the
          thorns which once he wore, amid the splendors of his regal state in
          Paradise he is not unmindful of his children here below. Still is he
          persecuted when Saul persecutes the saints, still are his brethren as
          the apple of his eye, and very near his heart. If ye can find in
          Christ a grain of selfishness, consecrate yourselves unto your lusts,
          and let Mammon be your God. If ye can find in Christ a solitary atom
          of hardness of heart and callousness of spirit, then justify
          yourselves, ye viscose hearts are as stones to the wailing of the
          desolate. But if ye profess to be followers of the Man of Nazareth, be
          ye full of compassion; he feeds the hungry lest they faint by the way;
          he bindeth up the broken in heart and healeth all their wounds; he
          heareth the cry of the needy and precious shall their blood be his
          sight; therefore be ye also tenderhearted also very affectionate the
          one toward the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Dear friends, though this last reason will certainly be to a
          Christian heart the very best that can be urged, yet permit me to
          suggest another. Sympathy is essential to our usefulness. I know that
          a man in the ministry who cannot feel had much better resign his
          office. We have heard some hold forth the doctrines of grace, as if
          they were a nauseous medicine, and men were to be forced to drink
          thereof by hard words and violent abuse. We have always thought that
          such men did more hurt than good, for while seeking to vindicate the
          letter, they evidently missed the spirit of the faith once delivered
          unto the saints. Cold and impassive are some of our divines; they
          utter truth as though it were no concern of theirs whether men
          received it or no. To such men heaven and hell, death and eternity,
          are mere themes for oratory, but not subjects for emotion. The man who
          will do good must throw himself into his words; and put his whole
          being into intense communion which the truth which he utters. God's
          true minister cannot preach a sermon upon the ruin of man without
          feeling a deep amazement in his own spirit, because of the burden of
          the Lord. He cannot, on the other hand, unfold the joys of pardon and
          the love of Jesus without a leaping heart and rejoicing tongue. The
          man who is devoid of love will be devoid of power, for sympathies are
          golden chains by which Christian orators draw men's ears and hearts to
          themselves and the truths they teach. |I preached,| said one, |when
          spake of condemnation as though I wore the chains about my own arm,
          and heard them clanking in my ears.| |And I,| another might have said,
          |I preached of pardon bought with blood, as though I had myself just
          come up from the sacred fountain, having left my foulness all behind,
          and being girt about with the white linen which is the righteousness
          of the saints.| If our hearers perceive that we do not really long for
          their good, that our preaching is but a matter of mere routine to be
          got through as so much irksome |duty,| can we hope to win their
          hearts? But when they feel that there is a roving hears within the
          preacher, then they give the more earnest heed to the things whereof
          we spells. You Sunday-school teachers, you must have warm hearts or
          you will be of little use to your children. You street-preachers, City
          missionaries, Bible women, and tract distributors, you who in any way
          seek to serve our Lord -- a heart, a heart, a heart, a tender heart, a
          flaming heart, a heart saturated with intense sympathy, this, when
          sanctified by the Holy Spirit, will give you success in your
          endeavors. Name the men the wide world over who have been the most
          successful in bending multitudes to their own will, and they are the
          men who have the largest hearts. For good or evil, heart-power is real
          power. The men whose hearts move with mighty pulsations like the
          piston-rod of a steam engine, will soon move the wheels and drag along
          the ponderous load. We must have within us the engine of the heart,
          throbbing mightily and continually, and then shall we draw the hearts
          of men with irresistible force.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Here I must supplement that thought with another; sympathy may
          often be the direct means of conversion. How do the Romanists craftily
          avail themselves of this! The loaves and fishes have always been used
          at Rome as an attraction to the multitude. Still the Sister of Mercy,
          with her basket on her arm, goes to the poor, or devotes herself to
          the sick -- and in this we praise them; were it the gospel they had to
          teach, they could scarcely have found a wiser method for its
          propagation; and be it what it may which they have to disseminate,
          they certainly have not failed for lack of wisdom. I would that we who
          have a purer faith, could remember a little more the intimate
          connection between the body and the soul. Go to the poor man and tell
          him of the bread of heaven, but first give him the bread of earth, for
          how shall he hear you with a starving body? Talk to him of the robe of
          Jesu's righteousness, but you will do it all the better when you have
          provided a garment with which he may cover his nakedness. It seems an
          idle tale to a poor man if you talk to him of spiritual things and
          cruelly refuse him help as to temporals. Sympathy, thus expressed, may
          be a mighty instrument for good; and even without this, if you be too
          poor to be able to carry out the pecuniary part of benevolence, a kind
          word, a look, a sentence or two of sympathy in trouble, a little
          loving advice, or an exhortation to your neighbor to cast his burden
          on the Lord, may do much spiritual service. I do not know, but I think
          if all our Church-members were full of love, and would always deal
          kindly, there would be very few hearts that would long hold out, at
          least from hearing the Word. You ask a person to hear your preacher;
          but he knows that you are crotchety, short-tempered, illiberal, and he
          is not likely to think much of the Word which, as he thinks, has made
          you what you are; but if, on the other hand, he sees your
          compassionate spirit, he will first be attracted to you, then next to
          what you have to say, and then you may lead him as with a thread, and
          bring him to listen to the truth as it is in Jesus, and who can tell
          but thus, through the sympathy of your tender heart, you may be the
          means of bringing him to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. And I shall say here, that this sympathy is sure to be a great
          blessing to yourselves. If you want joy -- joy that you may think upon
          at nights, and live upon day after day, next to the joy of the Lord,
          which is our strength, is the joy of doing good. The selfish man
          thinks that he has the most enjoyment in laying out his wealth upon
          himself. Poor fool! his interest is vastly small compared with the
          immense return which generosity, and liberality, and sympathy bring to
          the man who exercises them. Be ye assured that we can know as much joy
          in another's joy as in our own joy. Then, beside the joy it brings,
          there is experience. Experimental knowledge may be gained by it. I
          would not, of course, aver that a man can get experience without
          having trouble himself, but the next best thing to it, is to bear
          other people's troubles. We may never have known what it is to want
          bread, but to see a saint who has been brought to the door of
          starvation, and yet has had his bread given and his water sure, may be
          almost as useful. You and I may not be tortured with the pangs of
          sickness or the weakness of decay, but to climb some three pairs of
          stairs to a miserable back room, and to see a child of God patient in
          his tribulation, and to put ourselves by sympathy upon his bed, and
          suffer and smart with him, may give us the next best thing to the
          experience itself. I do think, brethren, that some men may live twenty
          lives, and get the experience of twenty men, and the information and
          real good of twenty men's troubles, by having large hearts which can
          hold the sorrows of others. Oh! we cannot tell how much blessedness we
          might receive if we were more free to aid our fellows. |It is more
          blessed to give than to receive.| Ask any man who has been to visit
          the sick, the poor, and the needy, whether he has not come home more
          resigned to his own trials, and more satisfied with his own lot. We
          gave a shilling, and received a casket of pearls, which dropped from
          the lips of the poor suffering-one while he told of God's
          faithfulness, and the preciousness of the love of Christ. We are great
          losers when we know not these rich poor saints. If we would but trade
          with them 'twere a blessed barter for us. Coral and pearl -- let no
          mention be made of them in comparison with the priceless gems which we
          might receive if we had greater sympathy and fuller communion with the
          suffering sons and daughters of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I said as much as may be fitting this morning in
          commendation of Christian sympathy.
        </p>
        <p>II. We speak now of THE HINDRANCES TO CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY.</p>
        <p>
          Some say that there is very little Christian sympathy abroad. I do not
          believe them, except as regards themselves. I dare say they have
          measured other men's corn with their own bushels. When any say, |O,
          there is no love in the Church,| I have always noticed that, without
          exception, they have no love themselves. On the other hand, we have
          heard others say, |What a blessed unity there is in the Church; when
          we come to the Tabernacle it does us good to get such hearty shakes of
          the hand, and to see such love in every brother's eye.| When they
          speak thus, I know the reason is that they carry fire in their own
          hearts, and then they think the Church warm, while the others carry
          lumps of ice in their hearts, and then they imagine that everybody
          must be cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. One of the great impediments to Christian sympathy is our own
          intense selfishness. We are all selfish by nature, and it is a work of
          grace to break this thoroughly down, until we live to Christ, and not
          to self any longer. How often is the rich man tempted to think that
          his riches are his own. A certain lady being accosted by a beggar, who
          asked charity of her; she gave him a shilling, saying, |Take that
          shilling; it is more than God ever gave me.| The beggar said, |O,
          Madam, but God has given you all your abundance.| |Nay,| said she,
          |but I am right; God has only lent me what I have; all I have is a
          loan.| I would that all who are entrusted with this world's substance
          felt that it was only loaned out to them, and that they were stewards.
          Now, a steward, when he has orders to give a poor man a large sum of
          money, does not say, |Dear me, that will make me poor!| He never
          considered that which was entrusted to him belonged to him, and so he
          gives it freely enough. So, remember, you have nothing of your own;
          specially you Christian men, who have been bought with a price, you
          are in a double sense stewards unto God, and should act as such;
          living to God, we should devote ourselves to the good of the race for
          Jesus' sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another hindrance lies in the customs of our country. We still have
          amongst us too much of caste and custom. The exclusiveness of rank is
          not readily overcome. It is not so, I thank God, in this place of
          worship, but I have known many places of worship where there are tiers
          of Christian people, layer on layer, who never associate with each
          other. In some places of worship they put up in conspicuous letters,
          |FREE SEATS FOR THE POOR.| I do abominate that! Then you have another
          class -- respectable tradesmen, but though they sit at the some table
          with the dons, and my lord this or that, they never think for a moment
          of speaking to them. When people come out of Church, what a gradation
          there is! Have I not seen in many a country village how, first of all,
          the squire goes out, and then the bailiff follows, and then all the
          poor people curtsey and bow to show their abject servitude and
          serfdom. And all this in a Christian land! In our Dissenting places of
          worship what stiffness there is; what rustling of the silks up one
          aisle, and what quietude of the cottons in another! When the members
          come together Lady So-and-so, who sits yonder, or Miss This, who sits
          there, will hardly recognize Nancy That, or Betsy So-and-so? Now I
          feel as much pleased in associating with the poorest of God's saints
          as with those who are of a higher degree in this world, for I believe
          the happy fusion of all will promote the interests of all. It would
          vex my heart to see you grow into the stuck-up respectability of some
          of our fine congregations. Away for ever with these castes and
          divisions; let us maintain the family feeling, and suffer nothing to
          violate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Much want of sympathy is produced by our ignorance of one another.
          We do not know the sufferings of our fellows. If I had brought the
          newspaper here to-day, and I had half a mind to do so, and had read
          you some extracts about the sufferings in Preston, and Wigan, and the
          various towns in Lancashire, you would have known much more about the
          distress than you do now. Or if, which would do as well, you were to
          go next Monday with some City missionary to the least East end, or St.
          Giles's, or some poor district this side the water you would say,
          |Dear me, I did not know that people really did suffer at this rate; I
          had no idea of it or I would have given more to the poor.| We want to
          be educated into the knowlege of our national poverty; we want to be
          taught and trained, to know more of what our fellow-men can and do
          suffer. Oh! if the Christian Church knew the immorality of London, she
          would cry aloud to God. If but for one night you could see the
          harlotry and infamy, if you could but once see the rascality of London
          gathered into one mass, your hearts would melt with woe and
          bitterness, and you would bow yourselves before God and cry unto him
          for this city as one that mourneth for his only son, even for his
          firstborn.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. No doubt the abounding deception which exists among those who seek
          our help has checked much liberality. I think I can tell the moment a
          man opens his mouth to address me, when a man wants to beg of me.
          There is such a particular whine and a sanctified unction, that the
          moment you hear it, you think, |I will give that man nothing; he is an
          old established beggar, and gets his living by it.| Seeing, as I have
          done, not scores, but hundreds of these beings, there is a tendency to
          get one's heart hard and callous, and to say |Oh! they are all
          deceivers.| But they are not all such; there is a vast amount of real
          distress of a private character, a suffering which will not cry nor
          moan; and I take it that it ought to be your business and mine to seek
          out these cases; not to stop till they come to us, but to go to them,
          avoiding ever, with a stern discretion, those ill cases which do but
          prey upon Christian charity, but seeking out the genuine sufferers,
          and giving them relief. Let none of these things, great obstacles
          though they be, hinder your sympathy to-day, for none of them exist in
          the case which we shall have to plead this morning.
        </p>
        <p>III. A few minutes upon THE FRUITS OF CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY.</p>
        <p>
          1. The fruit of Christian sympathy will be seen in a kindly
          association with all Christians: we shall not shun them nor pass them
          by.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will be seen next, in a kindly encouragement of those who want
          aid, constantly being ready to give a word of good advice, and good
          cheer to the heart which is ready to faint. Dear Christian friends, I
          think our experience is not so available as it might be for the good
          of others. In the olden times they that feared the Lord spoke often
          one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard. You will find your
          brethren often distressed in mind; you have passed through the same
          stage; conversation with them will help them to escape as you have
          done. More especially is this conversation very valuable under the
          pangs of conviction. When a young man or woman has been awakened under
          the ministry, I charge you each before God, you that have found peace
          in Christ, to watch the throes and agonies of the new birth, and be at
          hand to take the little child and nurse it for Christ. The senior
          members of every Christian Church should consider themselves, as
          called by their very position to look after the young. We have some
          such here; we want a few more. We want you mothers in Israel,
          especially, to be so sympathetic that you may no sooner hear that a
          soul is in distress than you are in distress too till you can have
          poured in the oil and the wine into their wounds. I think this
          sympathy should be especially shown to any that backslide. There is a
          tendency to cut such off from the Church-book and then leave them.
          This should not be; we must look after that which is out of the way.
          The shepherd must leave the ninety and nine sheep to go after the one
          which has gone astray. If you see one vacillating be most careful
          there. If you detect in any a growing coldness, be the more anxious to
          foster that which remains, which is ready to die. Let a holy
          discipline and watchfulness be maintained over the entire Church, by
          the care and forethought of every one for his next friend. Thus can
          you practically allow your Christian sympathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Show it, also, whenever you hear the good name of any called into
          doubt. Stand up for your brethren. 'Tis an ill bird that fouls its own
          nest, but there are some such birds. The moment they hear a word or a
          whisper against a Christian man, though a member of the same Church,
          |Report it, report it| say they; always pretending that they are very
          sorry, but all the while sucking it as a dainty morsel. The old
          proverb, you know, was, |We have done dinner; clear the things away,
          and now let us sit down and crack other men's characters.| I fear me
          there are even some professing Christians who do that. This is not
          sympathy but the malice of Satan: may God deliver you from it! Stand
          up for all that are your fellow-soldiers: be jealous of the honor of
          the regiment in which you have enlisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But still there is no Christian sympathy in all this if it does not
          when needed, prove itself by real gifts of our substance. Zealous
          words will not warm the cold; delicate words will not feed the hungry;
          the freest speech will not set free the captive, or visit him in
          prison; the most adorned words will not clothe the naked, and the
          words that are most full of unction will not pour oil and wine into
          the wounds of the sick. Words! Words! Words! Chaff! Chaff!! Chaff!!!
          If there be no act there is no sympathy. |Whoso hath this world's
          good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of
          compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps some of my hearers this morning will say that the text and the
          subject are appropriate to the occasion, but that they want some
          spiritual food. Well, you get that often, I trust, here; but I am
          persuaded that there are times when, if Christ were upon earth, he
          would dwell mainly upon these themes of practical Christianity. I read
          my Master's Sermon on the Mount, and what doctrine is there in it? It
          is all precept from beginning to end; and so shall my sermon be this
          morning; not doctrine, but precept; for this I know, we want to see in
          the Christian world more of the practical carrying out of the loving
          benevolence of the Savior. What care I about the doctrines for which
          you fight, unless they produce in you the spirit of Christ? What care
          I for your forms of faith and your ceremonies, if all the while you
          are a Nabal, wickedly saying in your heart, |Shall I take my bread and
          my water to give it unto these strangers?| Oh! let your faith be a
          living faith, lest, while you have the form of godliness, you deny the
          power thereof. Time was when, wherever a man met a Christian he met a
          helper. |I shall starve!| said he, until he saw a Christian's face,
          and then he said, |Now shall I be aided.| But some have thrown
          benevolence aside, and imagine that these are old duties of a legal
          character. Legal, then, will I be, when, in my Master's name, again I
          say, |To do good and to communicate forget not, for with such
          sacrifices God is well pleased.|
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I now conclude with an appeal for the special object of the
          collection this morning. I ASK YOUR AID FOR THESE NEEDY ONES IN
          LANCASHIRE.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Remember, first, that their poverty is no fault of their own. They
          are not brought to it by excess of meats or drinks. They are not
          reduced to it by riot or disorder. It is not idleness; it is not a
          wilful strike against the masters. It is utterly unavoidable; and
          here, therefore, is the right place for benevolence to display itself.
          The Egyptian hieroglyph for charity is very suggestive. It is a naked
          child giving honey to a bee which has lost its wings. Notice, it is a
          child: we should give in meekness. It is a naked child: we should give
          from pure motives, and not for show. It is a child feeding a bee; not
          a drone, but one that will work; a bee that has lost its wings; one,
          therefore, which has lost its power to supply itself: a picture before
          you of those martyrs and confessors of industry whose cause I plead
          to-day. A bee that has lost its wings makes its appeal for a little
          honey to every childlike heart here today, and they who are true to
          God will not refuse it their aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Remember, too, that the cause of this suffering is a national sin
          -- the sin of slavery. We have not yet passed the third generation,
          and upon a nation God visits sin to the third and fourth generation.
          We have rid ourselves, at last, of this accursed stain so far as our
          present Government is concerned, we are therefore delivered from any
          fear in future on that groun; but still, if slavery be now in America,
          we must remember that it would not have been there if it had not been
          carried there, and we are partners in guilt. Moreover, there has been
          too much winking at slavery amongst the merchants of Manchester and
          Liverpool. There has not been that abhorrence of the evil which should
          have been, and therefore it is just in the Providence of God that when
          America is cut with the sword we should be made to smart with the rod.
          If the Lord is pleased to smite our nation in one particular place,
          yet we must remember that it is meant for us all. Let us all bear the
          infliction as our tribulation, and let us cheerfully take up the
          burden, for it is but a little one compared with what our sins might
          have brought upon us. Better far for us to have famine than war. From
          all civil war and all the desperate wickedness which it involves, good
          Lord deliver us; and if thou smitest us as thou hast done, it is
          better to fall into the hand of God than into the hand of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I must also refresh your memories, though you know it well, with
          the fact of the patient endurance of those who have been called to
          suffer. You have read of no burning of mills, no breaking open of
          baker's shops. You have heard no accusations brought against the
          aristocracy; you have heard of no great political movement for the
          upsetting of our institutions. There was never upon earth a nobler
          spectacle than that of these men suffering so Frightfully with their
          wives and children, and yet enduring it so patiently. They deserve to
          be helped. If ever there was a case in which human ears must be opened
          to hear the cry of woe, this is it. If you and I had our wives and
          children at home starving, and had nothing but the charity of the
          parish and the little relief of the committees, making only some
          one-and-fourpence or one-and-sixpence a head to live upon for a week,
          I am afraid we should begin to think that we could re-adjust the
          machinery of Government; or it might happen that if we saw bread and
          could not get it we might break the window, or do some unrighteous act
          to take away another man's property sooner than see our children
          starve. They suffer well; they suffer well, brethren; and we do not
          well unless we help them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Moreover, remember how widely spread is this distress. I know too
          many of my dear hearers are often brought to as great poverty as the
          operatives in Lancashire, but then you have some little help;
          sometimes the Church can give it; at other times some friend, not
          quite so badly off as you are, will help you. But there, if a poor man
          wants a loaf, he cannot get it of the tradesman even on credit, for
          the tradesman has no power to give him credit. Nor can these people
          borrow of their neighbors, for where all are equally destitute one
          cannot help another. Even the Churches fail to do what they would wish
          to do. In the case of one dear brother, late a student in our college,
          to whom we constantly send supplies week by week, and who maintains a
          class of some forty young women, and in answer to the cry of faith has
          found all the means, I hope to aid him by this collection of to-day.
          The distress is not only with the poor now, but with those a little
          above them, and God only knoweth to what extent it must go unless in
          his gracious Providence he by some means or other, bringeth a supply
          of cotton that they may once again be at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Wherefore need I urge you, my hearers? I feel that you are ready
          now to assist these suffering ones. Let your own gratitude to God move
          you. Blessed be God that you have not this famine and straitness of
          bread. Thank the Master that though times may be hard, and some may
          now and then complain, yet we have not to walk through our streets and
          see our factories shut up, and miss the smoke which marks the daily
          toil that brings food to hungry mouths. We have not to know every
          habitation is a Bochim because the strong man boweth down for lack of
          bread, and the faces of the children are wan, and the mothers weep,
          and even the breasts refuse the infant child its needed nourishment.
          Give as God has prospered you. He that giveth to the poor lendeth to
          the Lord, and the Lord shall remember him in the time of trouble. He
          that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting life freely
          given him; let him, therefore, freely give, even as he hath Freely
          received.
        </p>
        <p>
          * This refers to a cotton famine that had devastated Lancashire. The
          cause of the famine was, curiously enough, the American Civil War.
          Cotton shipments from the American South had been blockaded by Union
          forces, thus effectively putting the cotton mills in Lancashire out of
          business. The results were far-reaching and disastrous for the cotton
          manufacturing district of England.<br />
