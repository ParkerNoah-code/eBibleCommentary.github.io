        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1862)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, September 27th, 1885, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          |And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
          glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
          and truth.| -- John 1:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          |For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
          Christ.| -- John 1: 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE WAS A TIME when God freely communed with men. The voice of the
          Lord God was heard walking in the garden in the cool of the day. With
          unfallen Adam the great God dwelt in sweet and intimate fellowship;
          but sin came and not only destroyed the garden, but destroyed the
          intercourse of God with His creature man. A great gulf opened between
          man as evil, and God as infinitely pure; and had it not been for the
          amazing goodness of the most High, we must all of us forever have been
          banished from His presence, and from the glory of His power. The Lord
          God in infinite love resolved that He Himself would bridge the
          distance, and would again dwell with man; and in token of this He made
          Himself manifest to His chosen nation Israel when they were in the
          wilderness. He was pleased to dwell in type and symbol among His
          people, in the very center and heart of their camp. Do you see yonder
          tent with its curtains of goats' hair in the center of the canvas
          city? You cannot see within it; but it was all glorious within with
          precious wood, and pure gold, and tapestry of many colors. Within its
          most sacred shrine shone forth a bright light between the wings of
          cherubim, which light was the symbol of the presence of the Lord. But
          if you cannot see within, yet you can see above the sacred tent a
          cloud, which arises from the top of the Holy of Holies, and then
          expands like a vast tree so as to cover all the host, and protect the
          chosen of God from the intense heat of the sun, so apt to make the
          traveler faint when passing over the burning sand. If you will wait
          till the sun is down, that same cloud will become Alimonies, and light
          up the whole camp. Thus it was both shade and light; and by its means
          was enjoyed that safety which was afterwards set forth in the promise,
          |The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.| Over all
          the glory was a defense and a comfort. The Lord dealt not so with any
          nation, save only His people Israel, of whom He said, |I will dwell in
          them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my
          people.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of the type is over; we see no more a nation secluded from all
          others and made to be as |the church in the wilderness.| God doth not
          now confine His abode to one people; for |The God of the whole earth
          shall he be called.| There is now no spot on earth where God dwells in
          preference to another. Did not our Lord say, at the well of Sychar,
          |Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
          mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.| |But . . . the
          true worshipers shall worship the Father it spirit and in truth|?
          Wherever true hearts seek the Lord, He is found of them. He is as much
          present on the lone mountain's side as in the aisles of yonder above,
          or in the galleries of this tabernacle. |Howbeit the most High
          dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven
          is my throne, and earth is my footstool; what house will ye build me?
          saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet there is a true house of, a real temple of the infinite, a living
          abode of the Godhead. The epistle to the Hebrews speaks of |the true
          tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.| There is still a
          trysting-place where God doth still meet with man, and hold fellowship
          with him. That place is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, |in whom
          dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. |The manhood of
          Christ is become to us the anti-type of that tent in the center of the
          camp. God is in Christ Jesus; Christ Jesus is God; and in His blessed
          person God dwells in the midst of us as in a tent; for such is the
          force of the original in our text. |The Word was made flesh, and
          tabernacled, or tented, among us.| That is to say, in Christ Jesus the
          Lord dwelt among men, as God of old dwelt in His sanctuary in the
          midst of the tribes of Israel. This is very delightful and hopeful for
          us: the Lord God doth dwell among us through the incarnation of His
          Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the substance far excels the shadow; for in the wilderness the
          Lord only dwelt in the abode of man, but now His approach to us is
          closer, for He dwells in the flesh of man. |The Word was made flesh,
          and dwelt among us.| Note that word |flesh.| It doth not say, |The
          Word was made man|: it means that, but the use of the word |flesh
          brings the Lord Jesus still closer to us, and shows that He took on
          Him the very nature and substance of manhood: He did not merely assume
          the name and notion, and appearance, of manhood, but the reality: the
          weakness, the suffering, the mortality of our manhood He actually took
          into union with Himself. He was no phantom, or apparition, but He had
          a human body and a human soul. |The Word was made flesh.| When the
          Lord became bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, His incarnation
          in a human body brought Him far nearer to man than when He only abode
          within curtains, and occupied a tent in the midst of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is to be noted that God does in the person of Jesus not
          merely dwell among men; but He hath joined Himself unto men -- the
          Word not only dwelt in flesh, but |was made flesh.| It is impossible
          to use words which are exactly accurate to describe the wonderful
          incarnation of the Son of God in human flesh; but these words are used
          to show that our Lord is as truly and as really man as He is God. Not
          only does God dwell in the body of man; but our Lord Jesus is God and
          man in one person. He is not ashamed to speak of men as His brethren.
          |Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
          also himself likewise took part of the same with us. This approach to
          us is exceeding close. God was never one with the tabernacle, but in
          Christ Jesus He is one with us. This union hath in it a sweetness of
          sympathy, a tenderness of relationship, and a condensation of
          fellowship greatly to be admired. Now we listen to the music of that
          blessed name Emmanuel, |God with its.| In the person of the only
          begotten, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we see God reconciling
          the world unto Himself. Let us rejoice and be glad that we have in
          Jesus more than Israel had in the holy place of the tabernacles of the
          most High. The ancient believer gazed upon the sacred tent, he thought
          of the holy place of sacrifice, and the Holy of Holies, the inner
          shrine of the Lord's indwelling; but we have unfeignedly more, we have
          God in our nature, and in Him |truly our fellowship is with the
          Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.|
        </p>
        <p>
          In and around the tent wherein the Lord dwelt in the center of the
          camp there was a manifestation of the presence of God. This was the
          glory of that house: but how scanty was the revelation! A bright light
          which I have already mentioned, the Shekinah, is said to have shone
          over the mercy-seat; but the high priest only could see it, and he
          only saw it once in the year when he entered with blood within the
          veil. Outside, above the holy place, there was the manifest glory of
          the pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night. This sufficed to
          bear witness that God was there; but still, cloud and fire are but
          physical appearances, and cannot convey a true appearance of God, who
          is a spirit. God cannot be perceived by the senses; and yet the fiery,
          cloudy pillar could appeal to the eyes only. The excellence of the
          indwelling of God in Christ is this -- that there is in Him a glory as
          of the only begotten of the Father, the moral and spiritual glory of
          Godhead. This is to be seen, but not with the eyes; this is to be
          perceived, but not by the carnal senses: this is seen, and heard, and
          known, by spiritual men, whose mental perceptions are keener than
          those of sight and hearing. In the person of the Lord there is a glory
          which is seen by our faith, which is discerned of our renewed spirits,
          and is made to operate upon our hearts. The glory of God in the
          sanctuary was seen only by the priest of the house of Aaron; the glory
          of God in the face of Christ is seen by all believers, who are all
          priests unto God. That glory the priest beheld but once in the year;
          but we steadily behold that glory at all times, and are transformed by
          the sight. The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ is not a thing
          of outward appearance, to be beheld with the eyes, like the pillar of
          cloud and fire; but there is an abiding, steady luster of holy,
          gracious, truthful character about our Lord Jesus Christ, which is
          best seen by those who by reason of sanctification are made fit to
          discern it. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God;
          yea, they do see Him in Christ Jesus. |No man hath seen God at any
          time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he
          hath declared him.| Many of us besides the apostles can say, |We
          beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,
          full of grace and truth.| We have not seen Jesus raise the dead; we
          have not seen I Jim cast out devils; we have not seen Him hush the
          winds and calm the waves, but we do see, with our mind's eye, His
          spotless holiness, His boundless love, His superlative love and truth,
          His wondrous heavenliness; in a word, we have seen, and do see, His
          fullness of grace and truth; and we rejoice in the fact that the
          tabernacling of God among, men in Christ Jesus is attended with a more
          real glory than the mere brilliance of light and the glow of flame.
          The condescension of Christ's love is to us more glorious than the
          pillar of cloud, and the zeal of our Lord's self-sacrifice is more
          excellent than the pillar of fire. As we think of the divine mysteries
          which meet in the person of the Lord, we do not envy Israel the
          gracious manifestation vouchsafed her when |a cloud covered the tent
          of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord covered the
          tabernacle|; for we have all this and more in our incarnate God, who
          is with us always, even to the end of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Holy Spirit shall help me, I shall at this time say, first of
          all, Let us behold this tabernacling of God; and secondly, Let us
          avail ourselves of this tabernacling of God in all the ways for which
          it was intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, then, LET US BEHOLD THIS 'TABERNACLING OF GOD WITH US. |We
          beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,
          full of grace and truth. |In Jesus Christ all the attributes of God
          are to be seen; veiled, but yet verily there. You have only to read
          the gospels, to look with willing eyes, and you shall behold in Christ
          all that can possibly be seen of God. It is veiled in human flesh, as
          it must be; for the glory of God is not to be seen by us absolutely;
          it is toned down to these dim eyes of ours; but the Godhead is there,
          the perfect Godhead in union with the perfect manhood of Christ Jesus
          our Lord, to whom be glory forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two divine things are more clearly seen in Jesus than aught else. Upon
          these I would speak at this time, considering the two together, and
          then each one separately -- |Full of grace and truth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe the two glorious qualities, joined inseparably -- grace and
          truth -- and observe that they are spoken of in the concrete. The
          apostle says that the only begotten is |full of grace and truth.| He
          did not come to tell us about grace, but actually to bring us grace.
          He is not full of the news of grace and truth, but of grace and truth
          themselves. Others had been messengers of gracious tidings, but He
          came to bring grace. Others teach us truth, but Jesus is the truth. He
          is that grace and truth whereof others spoke. Jesus is not merely a
          teacher, an exhorter, a worker of grace and truth; but these heavenly
          things are in Him: He is full of them. I want you to note this. It
          raises such a difference between Christ and others: you go to others
          to hear of grace and truth, but you must go to Christ to see them.
          There may be, there is, grace in other men; but not as it is in
          Christ: they have take it as water flowing through a pipe, but He has
          it as water in its fountain and source. He has grace to communicate to
          the sons of men, grace without measure, grace essential and abiding.
          There is truth in others where God has wrought it, by His Spirit; but
          it is not in them as it is in Christ. In Him dwell the depth, the
          substance, the essence of the fact. Grace and truth come to us by Him,
          and yet they evermore abide in Him. I say again, our Lord did not
          merely come to teach grace and truth, or to impress them upon us; but
          He came to exhibit in His own person, life, and work, all the grace
          and truth which we need. He has brought us grace in rivers and truth
          in streams: of these He has an infinite fullness; of that fullness all
          His saints receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This grace and truth are blended. The |and| between the two words I
          would treat as more than a common conjunction. The two rivers unite in
          one fullness -- |Full of grace and truth|: that is to say. The grace
          is truthful grace, grace not in fiction nor in fancy, grace not to be
          hoped for and to be dreamed of, but grace every atom of which is fact;
          redemption which does redeem, pardon which does blot out sin, renewal
          which actually regenerates, salvation which completely saves. We have
          not here blessings which charm the ear and cheat the soul; but real,
          substantial favors from God that cannot lie. Then blend these things
          the other way. |Grace and truth|: the Lord has come to bring us truth,
          but it is not the kind of truth which censures, condemns, and
          punishes; it is gracious truth, truth steeped in love, truth saturated
          with mercy. The truth which Jesus brings to His people comes not from
          the judgment-seat, but from the mercy-seat; it hath a gracious drift
          and aim about it, and ever tends unto salvation. His light is the life
          of men. If thou art overshadowed with a dark truth which seems to
          deepen thy despair, look thou to it again and thou wilt perceive
          within it a hidden light which is sown for the righteous. The darkness
          of convincing and humbling truth maketh for light: by engendering
          despair of self, heart-searching truth is meant to drive thee to the
          true hope. There is grace to God's people in everything that falls
          from the lips of'.Jesus Christ. His lips are like lilies dropping
          sweet smelling myrrh; myrrh in itself is bitter, but such is the grace
          of our Lord Jesus that His lips impart sweetness to it. See how grace
          and truth thus blend, and qualify each other! The grace all true, and
          the truth is all gracious, This is a wondrous compound made according
          to the art of the divine Apothecary. Where else is grace so true, or
          truth so gracious?
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it is grace and truth balanced. I wish I were able to
          communicate my thoughts this morning as they came to me when I was
          meditating upon this passage; but this thought almost speaks for
          itself. The Lord Jesus Christ is full of grace; but then He has not
          neglected the other quality which is somewhat sterner, namely, that of
          truth. I have known many in this world very loving and affectionate,
          but they have not been faithful: on the other hand, I have known men
          to be sternly honest and truthful, but they have not been gentle and
          kind: but in the Lord Jesus Christ there is no defect either way. He
          is full of grace which doth invite the publican and the sinner to
          Himself; but He is full of truth which doth repel the hypocrite and
          Pharisee. He does not hide from man a truth however terrible it may
          be, but He plainly declares the wrath of God against all
          unrighteousness. But when He has spoken terrible truth, He has uttered
          it in such a gracious and tender manner, with so many tears of
          compassion for the ignorant and those that are out of the way, that
          you are much won by His grace as convinced by His truth. Our Lord's
          ministry is not truth alone, nor grace alone; but it is a balanced,
          well-ordered system of grace and truth. The Lord Himself is in His
          character |just and having salvation.| He is both King of
          righteousness and King of peace. He does not even save unjustly, nor
          does He proclaim truth unlovingly. Grace and truth are equally
          conspicuous in Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, notice here that these qualities in our Lord are at the full.
          He is |full of grace.| Who could be more so? In the person of Jesus
          Christ the immeasurable grace of God is treasured up. God has done for
          us by Christ Jesus exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or even
          think. It is not possible even for imagination to conceive of any
          person more gracious than God in Christ Jesus. You cannot desire,
          certainly you cannot require, anything that should exceed what is
          found of grace in the person, offices, work, and death of the only
          begotten. Come, ye that have large minds, and intellects that are
          creative, and see if ye can devise anything that should be mentioned
          in the same day with what God, in the infinite glory of His grace, has
          given us in the person of His Son. And there is an equal fullness of
          truth about our Lord. He Himself, as He comes to us as the revelation
          and manifestation of God, declares to us, not some truth, but all
          truth. All of God is in Christ; and all of God means all that is true,
          and all that is right, and all that is faithful, and all that is just,
          all that is according to righteousness arid holiness. Christ Jesus has
          brought to us the justice, truth, and righteousness of God to the
          full: He is the Lord our righteousness. There are no reserves of
          disagreeable faith in Christ. There is nothing hidden from us of truth
          that might alarm us, nor anything that might have shaken our
          confidence; nor, on the other hand, is any truth kept back which might
          have increased our steadfastness. He says, |If it were not so I would
          have told you.| Admire the full-robed splendor of the Sun of
          Righteousness. Ask not with Pilate, |What is truth?| but behold it in
          God's dear Son. Oh, I know not how to speak to you upon themes so full
          and deep! How shall 1, that am but as a twinkling dewdrop on a blade
          of grass, reflect the full glory of this Sun of Righteousness? But all
          truth and all grace dwell in Christ in all their fullness beyond
          conception, and the two lie in each other's bosoms forever, to bless
          us with boundless, endless joy and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I taken the two together. Now I want to dwell briefly on
          each one by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace is put first. |We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
          begotten of the Father, full of grace.| Jesus Christ is the Son of
          God; He is His only begotten Son. Others are begotten of God, but no
          other was ever begotten of God as Christ was; consequently, when He
          came into this world the glory that was about Him was a glory as of
          the only begotten. A very singular, and very special, and
          incommunicable glory abides in the person of our Lord. Part of this
          was the glory of His grace. Now, in the Old Testament, in that
          thirty-fourth chapter of Exodus, which we read in part this morning,
          you notice that the glory of God lay in His being |the Lord God,
          merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and
          truth.| The glory of the only begotten of the Father must lie in the
          same things as the glory of the Father, namely, in longsuffering and
          truth. In Christ there is a wonderful gentleness,.patience, pity,
          mercy, and love of God. Not merely did He teach the grace of God, and
          invite us to the grace of God, but in Himself He displayed the grace
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is seen, first, in His incarnation, It is a wonderful instance of
          divine grace that the word should be made flesh and dwell among us,
          and reveal His glory to us. Apart from anything that springs out of
          the incarnation of Christ, that incarnation itself is a wondrous act
          of grace. There must be hope for men now that man is next akin to God
          through Jesus Christ. The angels were not mistaken when they not only
          sang, |Glory to God in the highest,| but also, |on earth peace,
          goodwill towards men,| because in Bethlehem the Son of God was born of
          a virgin. God in our nature must mean God with gracious thoughts
          towards us. If the Lord had meant to destroy the race, He never would
          have espoused it and taken it into union with Himself. There is
          fullness of grace in the fact of the Word made flesh tabernacling
          among us.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than this, there is fullness of grace in the life of Christ when
          we consider that He lived in order to perfect Himself as our High
          Priest. Was He not made perfect through His sufferings, that He might
          sympathize with us in all our woes? He was compassed with infirmities,
          and bore our sorrows, and endured those crosses of the human life
          which press so heavily on our own shoulders; and all this to make
          Himself able to deal graciously with us in a tender and brotherly way.
          Apart from that which comes wonderful brotherhood, there is a
          bottomless depth of grace about the fellowship itself. The Lord Jesus
          cannot curse me, for He has borne my curse: He cannot be unkind to me,
          for He has shared my sorrows. If every pang that tends my heart has
          also rent His heart, and if into all my woes He has descended even
          deeper than I have gone, it must mean love to me, it cannot mean
          anything else; and it must mean truth, for Jesus did not play at
          fellowship, His griefs were real. I say then that this manifestation
          of God in the person of Christ Jesus is seen in His sorrowing life to
          be full of grace and truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then think for a minute of what He did. He was so full of grace that
          when He spoke His words dropped a fatness of grace, the dew of His own
          love was upon all His discourses; and when He moved about and touched
          men here and there, virtue went out of Him, because He was so full of
          it. At one time He spoke and pardoned a sinner, saying, |Thy sins be
          forgiven thee|; at another moment He battled with the consequences of
          sin, raising men from sickness and from death: He again He turned
          Himself and fought with the prince of darkness himself, and cast him
          out from those whom he tormented. He went about like a cloud which is
          big with rain, and therefore plentifully waters waste places. His life
          was boundless compassion. There was a power of grace about His
          garments, His voice, His look; and in all He was so true that none
          ever thought Him capable of subterfuge. Everywhere He went He
          scattered grace among the children of men; and He is just the same
          now; fullness of grace abides in Him still.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to His death, which was the pouring out of His soul, then
          His fullness of grace was seen. He was full of grace indeed, forasmuch
          as He emptied Himself to save men. He was Himself not only man's
          Saviour, but his salvation. He gave Himself for us. He was indeed full
          of grace when He bore our sins in His own body on the tree. His was
          love at its height, since He died on the cross, |the just for the
          unjust, to bring us to God,| pronounce the word |Substitution, | and
          you cannot help feeling that the Substitute fori guilty man was full
          of grace; or use that other word, | representative,| and remember that
          whatever Jesus did, He did as the covenant Head of His people. If He
          died, they died in Him; if He rose again, they rose in Him; if He
          ascended up on high, they ascended in Him; and if He sits at the right
          hand of God, they also sit in the heavenly places in Him. When He
          shall come a second time it shall be to claim the kingdom for His
          chosen as well as for Himself; and all the glory of the future ages is
          for them, and not for Himself alone. He saith, |Because I live, ye
          shall live also.| Oh, the richness of the grace and truth that dwell
          in our Lord as the representative of His people! He will enjoy nothing
          unless His people enjoy it with Him. |Where I am, there also shall my
          servant be.| |To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in
          Thy throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in
          his throne.|
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another word higher than |substitution,| higher than
          |representation,| and that is |union.| We are one with Christ, joined
          to Him by a union that never can be broken. Not only does He do what
          He does, representing us, but we are joined unto Him in one spirit,
          members of His body, and partakers of His glory. Is it not a miracle
          of love that worms of earth should ever be one with incarnate Deity,
          and so one that they never can be separated throughout the ages?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have shown you that there is in our Lord a fullness of grace.
          Your own thoughts will dig deeper than mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then it is said there is in Him also a fullness of truth, by which
          I understand that in Christ Himself, not merely in what He said, and
          did, and promised, there is a fullness of truth. And this is true,
          first, in the fact that He is the fulfillment of all the promises that
          went before concerning Him. God had promised great things by His
          prophets concerning the coming Messiah, but all those predictions are
          absolutely matters of fact in the person of the Well-beloved. |All the
          promises of God are yea and Amen in Christ Jesus.| Verily He hath
          bruised the serpent's head. Verily He hath borne our griefs, and
          carried our sorrows. Verily He hath proclaimed liberty to the
          captives. Verily He hath proved Himself a prophet like unto Moses.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to my second text, in verse seventeen, I understand our Lord
          Jesus to be |truth| in the sense of being the substance of all the
          types. The law that was given by Moses was but symbolical and
          emblematical; but Jesus is the truth. He is really that blood of
          sprinkling which speaketh better things than that of Abel; He is in
          very deed the Paschal lamb of God's Passover: He is the
          burnt-offering, the sin-offering, and the peace-offering -- all in
          one! He is the true scapegoat, the true morning and evening Lamb; in
          fact, He is in truth what all the types and figures were in pattern.
          Blessed by God, brethren, whenever you see great things in the Old
          Testament in the type, you see the real truth of those things it the
          person of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Jew had nothing that we have not;
          he had nothing even in outline and shadow which we have not obtained
          in substance. The covenant in its fullness is in Christ: the prophecy
          is in Moses, the fulfillment is in Jesus: the foreshadowing is in the
          law, the truth is in the Word made flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further than that, our Lord Jesus Christ is said to be grace and truth
          in this sense, that He truthfully deals with matters of fact in the
          case of our salvation. I know the notion of the world is that the
          salvation of Christ is a pretty dream, a handsome piece of sentiment.
          But there is nothing dreamy, about it: it is no fiction; it is fact
          upon fact. The Lord Jesus Christ does not gloss over or conceal the
          condition of man in his salvation; He finds man condemned, and takes
          him as condemned in the very worst sense, condemned of a capital
          offense; and as man's substitute He endures the capital penalty, and
          dies in the sinner's stead. The Lord Jesus views the sinner as
          depraved, yea, as dead in trespasses and sins, and He quickens him by
          His resurrection life. He does not wink at the result of the fall and
          of actual sin; but He comes to the dead sinner and quickens him; He
          comes to the diseased heart and heals it. To me the gospel is a
          wonderful embodiment of omnipotent wisdom and truth. If the gospel had
          said to men, |The law of God is certainly righteous, but it is too
          stern, too, exacting, and therefore God will wink it at many sins, and
          make provision for salvation by omitting to punish much of human
          guilt,| why, my brethren, we should always have been in jeopardy. If
          God could be unjust to save us, He could also be changeable, and cast
          us away. If there was anything rotten in the state of our salvation,
          we should fear that it would fail its at last. But our foundation is
          sure, for the Lord has excavated down to the rock; He has taken away
          every bit of mere sentiment and sham, and His salvation is real
          throughout. It is a glorious salvation of grace and truth, in which
          God takes the sinner as God is, on the principles of true
          righteousness; and yet saves him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it means more than that. The Lord deals with us in the way of
          grace, and that grace encourages a great many hopes, but those hopes
          are all realized, for He deals with us in truth. Our necessities
          demands great things, and grace actually supplies those great things.
          The old law could never make the comers thereunto perfect as
          pertaining to the conscience, but the grace of God makes believers
          perfect as pertaining to the conscience. If I were to sit down and try
          to imagine a flaw in the ground of my salvation by Christ, I could not
          do it. Believing as I do in Him who bore my sins in His own body on
          the tree, I feet that by no possibility can His atonement fail me. I
          have not imagination strong enough to feign a reason for distrust: I
          do not see hole or corner in which any charge could lurk against the
          man that believes in Jesus Christ. My conscience is satisfied, and
          more than satisfied. Sometimes it even seems to me that my sins could
          not have deserved that the Son of God should die. The atonement is
          greater than the sin. Speak of the vindication of the law! -- not the
          vindication even greater than the dishonor? Does not the law of God
          shine out more lustrous in its indescribable glory through the
          sacrifice of Christ as the penalty for sin, than it would have done
          had it never been broken, or had all the race of law-breakers been
          swept into endless destruction? O brothers in the salvation of Jesus
          there is a truth of grace unrivaled! There is a deep verity, a
          substantiality, an inward soul-satisfaction in the sacrifice of
          Christ, which makes us feel it is a full atonement -- a fountain of
          |grace and truth.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor have I yet quite brought out all the meaning, even if I have
          succeeded so far. Christ has brought to us |grace and truth|; that is
          to say, He works in believers both grace and truth. We want grace to
          rescue us from sin; He has brought it: we need truth in the inward
          parts; He has wrought it. The system of salvation by atonement is
          calculated to produce truthful men. The habit of looking for salvation
          through the great sacrifice fosters the spirit of justice, begets in
          us a deep abhorrence of evil, and a love for that which is right and
          true. By nature we are all liars, and either love or make a lie: for
          this cause we are content t with refuges of ties, and we compass
          ourselves with deceit. In our carnal state we are as full of guile as
          an egg is full of meat; but when the Lord comes to us it Christ, no
          longer imputing our trespasses to us, then He takes out of our heart
          that deceit and desperate wickedness which had else remained there. I
          say it, and dare avow it, that the system of salvation by the
          indwelling of God in Christ and the atonement offered by Him for men
          has a tendency in it to infuse grace into the soul and to produce
          truth in the life. The Holy Ghost employs it to that end. I pray that
          you and I may prove it so by the grace which causes us to love both
          God and man, Santa and the truthfulness with which we deal in all the
          affairs of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus has our Lord displayed the glory of God in the grace and truth
          with which He is filled. I am sorry have spoken so feebly on a theme
          so grand. May the Spirit bless you even through the infirmities of my
          speech!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I want a few minutes to say to you, Come brothers and sisters,
          LET US AVAIL OURSELVES OF THIS TABERNACLING OF GOD AMONG US.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, if God has come to dwell among men by the Word made flesh
          let us pitch our tent around this central tabernacle; do not let us
          live as if God were a long way off. To the Israelites God was equally
          near from every near from every quarter of the camp. The tabernacle
          was in the center, and the center is equally near to every point of
          the circumference. No true Israelite could say, |I must go across the
          sea, or soar up into the air, or dive into the depths to find my God.|
          Every Israelite could say |He dwelleth between the cherubim: I have
          but to go to His tabernacle to be in His presence and speak with Him.|
          Our God is not far from any one of His people this day. We are made
          nigh by the blood of Christ. God is everywhere present, but there is a
          higher presence of effectual grace in the person of the only begotten.
          Do not let us feel as if we worshiped a far-off God. Let us not repine
          as if we were deserted. Let us not feel alone, for the Father is with
          us.
        </p>
        <p>God is near thee, therefore cheer the sad soul.</p>
        <p>
          Open thy window towards Jerusalem, as Daniel did; pray, with thine eye
          upon Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead bodily the
          greatest nearness to us. God is never far away since Christ has come
          to dwell among men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let us resort to this central tabernacle to obtain grace tto
          help in time of need. Let us come to Christ without fear, for He hath
          grace to give, and He will give it to us abundantly whenever we need
          it. I like to think of the wording if my text. Leave out the
          parentheses, and it runs, |He dwelt among us full of grace.| He could
          not have dwelt among such provoking ones if he had not been full of
          grace.| But if He dwells among us full of grace, we need not fear that
          He will cast us away because of our sins and failings. I invite you,
          therefore to come boldly to Him who is full of forgiving love. I beg
          you to come and receive of His fullness, for grace is truly grace when
          it is communicated: grace which is not distributed is grace in name
          only. |Alas!| you say, |I want so much grace.| Brother, it is
          treasured up in Christ for you without measure. It is placed in Him
          that you may have it. Do we not try to persuade the sinner that there
          is life in a look? Shall I need to persuade saints that grace is
          equally free to them? Do we tell the sinner that God is not be sought
          for as far away, but that He is waiting to be gracious? Must I tell
          the believer the same? You may at this moment obtain all the grace you
          need. The door is open; enter and take what you will. Do not stop till
          you reach home and go through a set of religious exercises; but here,
          and now, believe in Jesus to the full. In the center of the camp is
          the incarnate God; Israel had but to go the central tent to find
          present help in time of trouble. In the person of Christ, who hath
          said, |I am with you always, even to the end of the world,| there is,
          in truth, all the grace you can possibly need. Come to this well and
          drink. Receive of His fullness, and go on your way rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          What next shall we do? Brethren, since God in Christ is in the midst
          of us, let us abide in joyful, peaceful confidence in Him who is grace
          and truth to us. Do not let us wander to other sources. To whom should
          we go? Shall we leave our God? Shall we leave His grace, His truth? Do
          not let us dream that He has changed, for He is God. Do not imagine
          that He has removed, for He hath said. |This my rest forever; here
          will I dwell, for I have desired it.| Do not let us conceive that His
          grace and truth are exhausted; for His fullness is eternal. Let us
          receive strong consolation, and remain steadfast, unmovable. Let us
          quietly rest in the firm belief that all we can want between here and
          heaven, all that we need this moment and in all moments yet to come,
          is treasured up in Christ Jesus, who is abidingly the center of His
          church and the manifestation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more: if this be so, and God really in Christ dwell in the midst
          of His people |full of grace and truth,| let us tell everybody of it.
          I am sure if I had been an Israelite in the wilderness, and had met an
          Amalekite or an Edomite, I should have gloried in the privileges which
          His presence secured me. We know that Amalekites and Edomites could
          not have come into the house of the Lord: but nowadays, if we meet
          with one who is a stranger, we can tell him of our privilege, with
          sweet persuasion that the stranger can be brought nigh through the
          blood of the Lamb. Therefore let us abundantly speak of the dwelling
          of God with men. Let us tell to all that the Lord has come to man, not
          in wrath, not in judgment, but |full of grace and truth.| O my
          unconverted hearer, come to Jesus! He is able to save to the uttermost
          those that come unto God by Him. Draw night to the meek and lowly
          Jesus, and you draw night to God. He saith, |He that hath seen me hath
          seen the Father.| Publish the invitation of grace to the four winds.
          Ring out your silver trumpets, or if you have them not, sound your
          ram's horns; but somehow let all people know that the tabernacle of
          God is with men, and He doth dwell among them. Tell out his news in
          the far country, that the wandering prodigal son may hear it, and cry,
          |I will arise, and go to my Father.| God has come to men' will not
          come to receive grace and truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          One more lesson remains, And that is -- what manner of people ought we
          to be among whom Jehovah dwells? It must have been a very solemn thing
          to be a member of that great camp of two million in the wilderness of
          Sinai. God's presence in the midst of the camp must have made every
          tent sacred. As we walked through the streets of that canvas city, if
          we had been Israelites, and in our right minds, we should have said,
          |These tents are none other than the house the house of God and the
          very gate of heaven; for see, Jehovah is in the midst of us. Mark you
          not the bright light that shines about His sanctuary?| We should have
          felt that in such in such a camp all should be holy. The pollution of
          sin should be unknown there. In such a camp constant prayer and praise
          should be presented to Him whose presence was its glory and defense.
          Today let our congregation be a holy convocation; and as for
          ourselves, let us be holiness unto the Lord. We are consecrated men
          and women, seeing the Lord has come so very near to us. I spoke of
          solemnity; I meant not dread and sorrow, but a solemnity full of joy.
          It is a solemn thing to have God so near, but the joy is equal to the
          solemnity. Glory be unto God most high, for He is here! Let us spend
          our days and nights in gladness and delight. God is reconciled to us
          in the person of His dear Son, and we have fellowship with God in
          Christ Jesus; Wherefore let us rejoice evermore. Amen and amen.
