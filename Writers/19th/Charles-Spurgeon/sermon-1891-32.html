          1. Others, again, portentously declare that there exists, in the power
          of Bythus, a certain primary light, blessed, incorruptible, and
          infinite: this is the Father of all, and is styled the first man. They
          also maintain that his Ennoea, going forth from him, produced a son,
          and that this is the son of man -- the second man. Below these, again,
          is the Holy Spirit, and under this superior spirit the elements were
          separated from each other, viz., water, darkness, the abyss, chaos,
          above which they declare the Spirit was borne, calling him the first
          woman. Afterwards, they maintain, the first man, with his son,
          delighting over the beauty of the Spirit -- that is, of the woman --
          and shedding light upon her, begat by her an incorruptible light, the
          third male, whom they call Christ, -- the son of the first and second
          man, and of the Holy Spirit, the first woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The father and son thus both had intercourse with the woman (whom
          they also call the mother of the living). When, however, she could not
          bear nor receive into herself the greatness of the lights, they
          declare that she was filled to repletion, and became ebullient on the
          left side; and that thus their only son Christ, as belonging to the
          right side, and ever tending to what was higher, was immediately
          caught up with his mother to form an incorruptible Æon. This
          constitutes the true and holy Church, which has become the
          appellation, the meeting together, and the union of the father of all,
          of the first man, of the son, of the second man, of Christ their son,
          and of the woman who has been mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They teach, however, that the power which proceeded from the woman
          by ebullition, being besprinkled with light, fell downward from the
          place occupied by its progenitors, yet possessing by its own will that
          besprinkling of light; and it they call Sinistra, Prunicus, and
          Sophia, as well as masculo-feminine. This being, in its simplicity,
          descended into the waters while they were yet in a state of
          immobility, and imparted motion to them also, wantonly acting upon
          them even to their lowest depths, and assumed from them a body. For
          they affirm that all things rushed towards and clung to that
          sprinkling of light, and begin it all round. Unless it had possessed
          that, it would perhaps have been totally absorbed in, and overwhelmed
          by, material substance. Being therefore bound down by a body which was
          composed of matter, and greatly burdened by it, this power regretted
          the course it had followed, and made an attempt to escape from the
          waters and ascend to its mother: it could not effect this, however, on
          account of the weight of the body lying over and around it. But
          feeling very ill at ease, it endeavoured at least to conceal that
          light which came from above, fearing lest it too might be injured by
          the inferior elements, as had happened to itself. And when it had
          received power from that besprinkling of light which it possessed, it
          sprang back again, and was borne aloft; and being on high, it extended
          itself, covered [a portion of space], and formed this visible heaven
          out of its body; yet remained under the heaven which it made, as still
          possessing the form of a watery body. But when it had conceived a
          desire for the light above, and had received power by all things, it
          laid down this body, and was freed from it. This body which they speak
          of that power as having thrown off, they call a female from a female.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They declare, moreover, that her son had also himself a certain
          breath of incorruption left him by his mother, and that through means
          of it he works; and becoming powerful, he himself, as they affirm,
          also sent forth from the waters a son without a mother; for they do
          not allow him either to have known a mother. His son, again, after the
          example of his father, sent forth another son. This third one, too,
          generated a fourth; the fourth also generated a son: they maintain
          that again a son was generated by the fifth; and the sixth, too,
          generated a seventh. Thus was the Hebdomad, according to them,
          completed, the mother possessing the eighth place; and as in the case
          of their generations, so also in regard to dignities and powers, they
          precede each other in turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They have also given names to [the several persons] in their system
          of falsehood, such as the following: he who was the first descendant
          of the mother is called Ialdabaoth; he, again, descended from him, is
          named Iao; he, from this one, is called Sabaoth; the fourth is named
          Adoneus; the fifth, Eloeus; the sixth, Oreus; and the seventh and last
          of all, Astanphæus. Moreover, they represent these heavens,
          potentates, powers, angels, and creators, as sitting in their proper
          order in heaven, according to their generation, and as invisibly
          ruling over things celestial and terrestrial. The first of them,
          namely Ialdabaoth, holds his mother in contempt, inasmuch as he
          produced sons and grandsons without the permission of any one, yea,
          even angels, archangels, powers, potentates, and dominions. After
          these things had been done, his sons turned to strive and quarrel with
          him about the supreme power, -- conduct which deeply grieved
          Ialdabaoth, and drove him to despair. In these circumstances, he cast
          his eyes upon the subjacent dregs of matter, and fixed his desire upon
          it, to which they declare his son owes his origin. This son is Nous
          himself, twisted into the form of a serpent; and hence were derived
          the spirit, the soul, and all mundane things: from this too were
          generated all oblivion, wickedness, emulation, envy, and death. They
          declare that the father imparted still greater crookedness to this
          serpent-like and contorted Nous of theirs, when he was with their
          father in heaven and Paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. On this account, Ialdabaoth, becoming uplifted in spirit, boasted
          himself over all those things that were below him, and exclaimed, |I
          am father, and God, and above me there is no one.| But his mother,
          hearing him speak thus, cried out against him, |Do not lie,
          Ialdabaoth: for the father of all, the first Anthropos (man), is above
          thee; and so is Anthropos the son of Anthropos.| Then, as all were
          disturbed by this new voice, and by the unexpected proclamation, and
          as they were inquiring whence the noise proceeded, in order to lead
          them away and attract them to himself, they affirm that Ialdabaoth
          exclaimed, |Come, let us make man after our image.| The six powers, on
          hearing this, and their mother furnishing them with the idea of a man
          (in order that by means of him she might empty them of their original
          power), jointly formed a man of immense size, both in regard to
          breadth and length. But as he could merely writhe along the ground,
          they carried him to their father; Sophia so labouring in this matter,
          that she might empty him (Ialdabaoth) of the light with which he had
          been sprinkled, so that he might no longer, though still powerful, be
          able to lift up himself against the powers above. They declare, then,
          that by breathing into man the spirit of life, he was secretly emptied
          of his power; that hence man became a possessor of nous (intelligence)
          and enthymesis (thought); and they affirm that these are the faculties
          which partake in salvation. He [they further assert] at once gave
          thanks to the first Anthropos (man), forsaking those who had created
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But Ialdabaoth, feeling envious at this, was pleased to form the
          design of again emptying man by means of woman, and produced a woman
          from his own enthymesis, whom that Prunicus [above mentioned] laying
          hold of, imperceptibly emptied her of power. But the others coming and
          admiring her beauty, named her Eve, and falling in love with her,
          begat sons by her, whom they also declare to be the angels. But their
          mother (Sophia) cunningly devised a scheme to seduce Eve and Adam, by
          means of the serpent, to transgress the command of Ialdabaoth. Eve
          listened to this as if it had proceeded from a son of God, and yielded
          an easy belief. She also persuaded Adam to eat of the tree regarding
          which God had said that they should not eat of it. They then declare
          that, on their thus eating, they attained to the knowledge of that
          power which is above all, and departed from those who had created
          them. When Prunicus perceived that the powers were thus baffled by
          their own creature, she greatly rejoiced, and again cried out, that
          since the father was incorruptible, he (Ialdabaoth) who formerly
          called himself the father was a liar; and that, while Anthropos and
          the first woman (the Spirit) existed previously, this one (Eve) sinned
          by committing adultery.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Ialdabaoth, however, through that oblivion in which he was
          involved, and not paying any regard to these things, cast Adam and Eve
          out of Paradise, because they had transgressed his commandment. For he
          had a desire to beget sons by Eve, but did not accomplish his wish,
          because his mother opposed him in every point, and secretly emptied
          Adam and Eve of the light with which they had been sprinkled, in order
          that that spirit which proceeded from the supreme power might
          participate neither in the curse nor opprobrium [caused by
          transgression]. They also teach that, thus being emptied of the divine
          substance, they were cursed by him, and cast down from heaven to this
          world. But the serpent also, who was acting against the father, was
          cast down by him into this lower world; he reduced, however, under his
          power the angels here, and begat six sons, he himself forming the
          seventh person, after the example of that Hebdomad which surrounds the
          father. They further declare that these are the seven mundane demons,
          who always oppose and resist the human race, because it was on their
          account that their father was cast down to this lower world.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Adam and Eve previously had light, and clear, and as it were
          spiritual bodies, such as they were at their creation; but when they
          came to this world, these changed into bodies more opaque, and gross,
          and sluggish. Their soul also was feeble and languid, inasmuch as they
          had received from their creator a merely mundane inspiration. This
          continued until Prunicus, moved with compassion towards them, restored
          to them the sweet savour of the besprinkling of light, by means of
          which they came to a remembrance of themselves, and knew that they
          were naked, as well as that the body was a material substance, and
          thus recognised that they bore death about with them. They thereupon
          became patient, knowing that only for a time they would be enveloped
          in the body. They also found out food, through the guidance of Sophia;
          and when they were satisfied, they had carnal knowledge of each other,
          and begat Cain, whom the serpent, that had been cast down along with
          his sons, immediately laid hold of and destroyed by filling him with
          mundane oblivion, and urging into folly and audacity, so that, by
          slaying his brother Abel, he was the first to bring to light envy and
          death. After these, they affirm that, by the forethought of Prunicus,
          Seth was begotten, and then Norea, from whom they represent all the
          rest of mankind as being descended. They were urged on to all kinds of
          wickedness by the inferior Hebdomad, and to apostasy, idolatry, and a
          general contempt for everything by the superior holy Hebdomad, since
          the mother was always secretly opposed to them, and carefully
          preserved what was peculiarly her own, that is, the besprinkling of
          light. They maintain, moreover, that the holy Hebdomad is the seven
          stars which they call planets; and they affirm that the serpent cast
          down has two names, Michael and Samael.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Ialdabaoth, again, being incensed with men, because they did not
          worship or honour him as father and God, sent forth a deluge upon
          them, that he might at once destroy them all. But Sophia opposed him
          in this point also, and Noah and his family were saved in the ark by
          means of the besprinkling of that light which proceeded from her, and
          through it the world was again filled with mankind. Ialdabaoth himself
          chose a certain man named Abraham from among these, and made a
          covenant with him, to the effect that, if his seed continued to serve
          him, he would give to them the earth for an inheritance. Afterwards,
          by means of Moses, he brought forth Abraham's descendants from Egypt,
          and gave them the law, and made them the Jews. Among that people he
          chose seven days, which they also call the holy Hebdomad. Each of
          these receives his own herald for the purpose of glorifying and
          proclaiming God; so that, when the rest hear these praises, they too
          may serve those who are announced as gods by the prophets.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Moreover, they distribute the prophets in the following manner:
          Moses, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Amos, and Habakkuk, belonged to
          Ialdabaoth; Samuel, and Nathan, and Jonah, and Micah, to Iao; Elijah,
          Joel, and Zechariah to Sabaoth; Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel,
          to Adonai; Tobias and Haggai to Eloi; Michaiah and Nahum to Oreus;
          Esdras and Zephaniah to Astanphæus. Each one of these, then, glorifies
          his own father and God, and they maintain that Sophia, herself has
          also spoken many things through them regarding the first Anthropos
          (man), and concerning that Christ who is above, thus admonishing and
          reminding men of the incorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of
          the descent of Christ. The [other] powers being terrified by these
          things, and marvelling at the novelty of those things which were
          announced by the prophets, Prunicus brought it about by means of
          Ialdabaoth (who knew not what he did), that emissions of two men took
          place, the one from the barren Elizabeth, and the other from the
          Virgin Mary.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. And since she herself had no rest either in heaven or on earth,
          she invoked her mother to assist her in her distress. Upon this, her
          mother, the first woman, was moved with compassion towards her
          daughter, on her repentance, and begged from the first man that Christ
          should be sent to her assistance, who, being sent forth, descended to
          his sister, and to the besprinkling of light. When he recognised her
          (that is, the Sophia below), her brother descended to her, and
          announced his advent through means of John, and prepared the baptism
          of repentance, and adopted Jesus beforehand, in order that on Christ
          descending he might find a pure vessel, and that by the son of that
          Ialdabaoth the woman might be announced by Christ. They further
          declare that he descended through the seven heavens, having assumed
          the likeness of their sons, and gradually emptied them of their power.
          For they maintain that the whole besprinkling of light rushed to him,
          and that Christ, descending to this world, first clothed his sister
          Sophia [with it], and that then both exulted in the mutual refreshment
          they felt in each other's society: this scene they describe as
          relating to bridegroom and bride. But Jesus, inasmuch as he was
          begotten of the Virgin through the agency of God, was wiser, purer,
          and more righteous than all other men: Christ united to Sophia
          descended into him, and thus Jesus Christ was produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. They affirm that many of his disciples were not aware of the
          descent of Christ into him; but that, when Christ did descend on
          Jesus, he then began to work miracles, and heal, and announce the
          unknown Father, and openly to confess himself the son of the first
          man. The powers and the father of Jesus were angry at these
          proceedings, and laboured to destroy him; and when he was being led
          away for this purpose, they say that Christ himself, along with
          Sophia, departed from him into the state of an incorruptible Æon,
          while Jesus was crucified. Christ, however, was not forgetful of his
          Jesus, but sent down a certain energy into him from above, which
          raised him up again in the body, which they call both animal and
          spiritual; for he sent the mundane parts back again into the world.
          When his disciples saw that he had risen, they did not recognise him
          -- no, not even Jesus himself, by whom he rose again from the dead.
          And they assert that this very great error prevailed among his
          disciples, that they imagined he had risen in a mundane body, not
          knowing that |flesh and blood do not attain to the kingdom of God.|
        </p>
        <p>
          14. They strove to establish the descent and ascent of Christ, by the
          fact that neither before his baptism, nor after his resurrection from
          the dead, do his disciples state that he did any mighty works, not
          being aware that Jesus was united to Christ, and the incorruptible Æon
          to the Hebdomad; and they declare his mundane body to be of the same
          nature as that of animals. But after his resurrection he tarried [on
          earth] eighteen months; and knowledge descending into him from above,
          he taught what was clear. He instructed a few of his disciples, whom
          he knew to be capable of understanding so great mysteries, in these
          things, and was then received up into heaven, Christ sitting down at
          the right hand of his father Ialdabaoth, that he may receive to
          himself the souls of those who have known them, after they have laid
          aside their mundane flesh, thus enriching himself without the
          knowledge or perception of his father; so that, in proportion as Jesus
          enriches himself with holy souls, to such an extent does his father
          suffer loss and is diminished, being emptied of his own power by these
          souls. For he will not now possess holy souls to send them down again
          into the world, except those only which are of his substance, that is,
          those into which he has breathed. But the consummation [of all things]
          will take place, when the whole besprinkling of the spirit of light is
          gathered together, and is carried off to form an incorruptible Æon.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Such are the opinions which prevail among these persons, by whom,
          like the Lernæan hydra, a many-headed beast has been generated from
          the school of Valentinus. For some of them assert that Sophia herself
          became the serpent; on which account she was hostile to the creator of
          Adam, and implanted knowledge in men, for which reason the serpent was
          called wiser than all others. Moreover, by the position of our
          intestines, through which the food is conveyed, and by the fact that
          they possess such a figure, our internal configuration in the form of
          a serpent reveals our hidden generatrix.<br />
