        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.108)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, August 31, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          |Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put
          strength in me.| -- Job 23:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          I SHALL not to-night consider the connexion of these words, or what
          was particularly intended by Job. I shall use them in, perhaps,
          another sense from that which he intended. No doubt Job meant to say,
          that if God would allow him to argue his case before him, it was his
          firm belief that God, so far from taking advantage of his superior
          strength in the controversy, would even strengthen him, that the
          controversy might be fair, and that the judgment might be unbiased.
          |He would not plead against me with his great strength; no, but he
          would put strength in me.| We shall use the text, however, to-night,
          in another sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one of the sure marks of a lost and ruined state when we are
          careless and indifferent concerning God. One of the peculiar marks of
          those who are dead in sin is this: they are the wicked who forget God.
          God is not in all their thoughts; |The fool hath said in his heart,
          there is no God.| The sinful man is ever anxious to keep out of his
          mind the very thought of the being, the existence, or the character of
          God; and so long as man is unregenerate, there will be nothing more
          abhorrent to his taste, or his feelings, than anything which deals
          with the Divine Being. God perhaps, as Creator, he may consider; but
          the God of the Bible, the infinite Jehovah, judging righteously among
          the sons of men -- condemning and acquitting -- that God he has no
          taste for, he is not in all his thoughts, nor does he regard him. And
          mark you, it is a blessed sign of the work of grace in the heart, when
          man begins to consider God. He is not far from God's heart who hath
          meditations of God in his own heart. If we desire to seek after God,
          to know him, to understand him, and to be at peace with him, it is a
          sign that God has dealings with our soul, for otherwise we should
          still have hated his name and abhorred his character.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things in my text, both of which have relation to the
          Divine Being. The first is, the question of fear: |Will he plead
          against me with his great power?| and the second is, the answer of
          faith: |No, but he will put strength in me.| The fearful and the
          prayerful, who are afraid of sin and fear God, together with those who
          are faithful and believe in God, are in a hopeful state; and hence,
          both the question of the one, and the answer of the other, have
          reference to the great Jehovah, our God, who is for ever to be adored.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We shall consider, in the first place, to-night THE INQUIRY OF
          FEAR: |Will he plead against me with his great power?| I shall
          consider this as a question asked by the convinced sinner. He is
          seeking salvation, but, when he is bidden to come before his God and
          find mercy, he is compelled by his intense anxiety to make the
          trembling inquiry, |Will he plead against me with his great power?|
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And, first, I gather from this question the fact that a truly
          penitent sinner has a right idea of many of God's attributes. He does
          not understand them all, for instance, he does not yet know God's
          great mercy; he does not yet understand his unbounded compassion; but
          so far as his knowledge of God extends, he has an extremely correct
          view of him. To him the everlasting Jehovah appears GREAT in every
          attribute, and action, and supremely GREAT in his Majesty. The poor
          worldling knows there is a God; but he is to him a little God. As for
          the justice of God, the mere worldly man scarcely ever thinks of it.
          He considers that there is a God, but he regards him as a Being who
          has little enough respect for justice. Not so, however, the sinner.
          When God has once convinced him of his sin, he sees God as a great
          God, a God of great justice, and of great power. Whoever can
          misunderstand God's great justice or God's great power, a convinced
          sinner never will. Ask him what he thinks of God's justice, and he
          will tell you it like the great mountains; it is high, he cannot
          attain unto it. |Ah,| saith he, |God's justice is very mighty; it must
          smite me. He must hurl an avalanche of woe upon my devoted head.
          Justice demands that he should punish me. I am so great a sinner that
          I cannot suppose he would ever pass by my transgression, my iniquity,
          and my sin.| It is all in vain for you to tell such a man that God is
          little in his justice; he replies, |No,| most solemnly, |No,| and you
          can most plainly read his earnestness in his visage, when he replies,
          |No.| He replies, |I feel that God is just; I am even now consumed by
          his anger; by his wrath am I troubled.| |Tell me God is not just,|
          says he; |I know he is; I feel that within an hour or two hell must
          swallow me up, unless Divine mercy delivers me. Unless Christ shall
          wash me in his blood, I feel I can never hope to stand among the
          ransomed.| He has not that strange idea of God's justice that some of
          you have. You think sin is a trifle! You suppose that one brief prayer
          will wipe it all away. You dream that by attendance at your churches
          and at your chapels, you will wash away your sins. You suppose that
          God, for some reason or other, will very easily forgive your sin. But
          you have no right idea of God's justice. You have not learned that God
          never does forgive until he has first punished, and that if he does
          forgive any one, it is because he has punished Christ first in the
          stead of that person. But he never forgives without first exacting the
          punishment. That would be an infringement on his justice; and shall
          not the Judge of all the earth do right? You have, many of you, lax
          enough ideas of the justice of the Divine Being; but not so the sinner
          who is laboring under a knowledge of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          An awakened soul feels that God is greatly powerful. Tell him that God
          is but a weak God, and he will answer you; and shall I tell you what
          illustrations he will give you, to prove that God is great in power.
          He will say, |Oh, sir, God is great in power as well in justice; look
          up yonder: can you not see in the dark past, when rebel angels sinned
          against God, they were so mighty that each one of them might have
          devastated Eden and shaken the earth. But God, with ease, hurled Satan
          and the rebel angels out of heaven, and drove them down to hell.|
          |Sir,| saith the sinner, |is he not mighty?| And then he will go on to
          tell you how God unbound the swaddling bands of the great ocean, that
          it might leap upon the earth; and how he bade it swallow up the whole
          of mortal race, save those who were hidden in the ark. And the sinner
          says, with his eyes well nigh starting from their sockets, |Sir, does
          not this prove that he is great in power, and will by no means acquit
          the wicked?| And then he proceeds, |Look again at the Red Sea; mark
          how Pharaoh was enticed into its depths, and how the parted sea, that
          stood aloof for awhile to give the Israelites an easy passage,
          embraced with eager joy, locked the adverse host within their arms,
          and swallowed them up quick;| and as he thinks he sees the Red Sea
          rolling o'er the slain, he exclaims, |Sir, God is great in power; I
          feel he must be, when I think of what he has done.| And as if he had
          not finished his oration, and would let us know the whole of the
          greatness of God's power, he continues his narration of the deeds of
          vengeance. |O sir, remember, he must be great in power, for I know
          that he hath digged a hell, which is deep and large, without bottom.
          He hath made a Tophet -- the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and
          the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, shall kindle it.|
          |Yes, beyond a doubt,| groans the trembling soul, |he must be great in
          power. I feel he is, and I feel more than that; I feel that justice
          has provoked God's arm of power to smite me, and unless I am covered
          in that righteousness of Christ, I shall ere long be dashed to pieces,
          and utterly devoured by the fury of his wrath.| The sinner, as far as
          the harsher attributes of God's nature are concerned, when he is under
          conviction, has a very fair and a just idea of the Divine Being,
          though, as I have remarked before, not yet understanding the mercy and
          the infinite compassion of God towards his covenant people, he has too
          harsh a view of God, dwelling only upon the darker side, and not upon
          those attributes which shed a more cheering light upon the darkness of
          our misery. That is the first truth which I glean from the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The second truth which I gather from this question, |Will he plead
          against me with his great power?| is this: that the trembling sinner
          feels that every attribute of God is against him as a sinner. |Oh!| he
          will say, |I look to God, and I can see nothing in him but a consuming
          fire. I look to his justice, and I see it, with sword unsheathed,
          ready to smite me low. I look to his power, and I behold it, like a
          mighty mountain, tottering to its fall, to crush me. I look to his
          immutability, and methinks I see stern justice written on its brow,
          and I hear it cry, Sinner, I will not save, I will condemn thee.' I
          look to his faithfulness, and I mark that all his threatenings are as
          much yea and amen' as his promises. I look to his love, but even his
          love frowns, and accuses me, saying, thou hast slighted me.' I look to
          his mercy, but even his mercy launches out the thunderbolt, with
          accusing voice, reminding me of my former hardness of heart, and
          harshly chiding me thus, Go thou to justice, and glean what thou canst
          there. I, even I, am against thee, for thou hast made me wroth!'|
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! trembling penitent, where art thou to-night? Somewhere here, I
          know thou art. Would to God there were many like thee! I know thou
          wilt agree with me in this statement, for thou hast a dread
          apprehension that every attribute of the Divine Being's character is
          armed with fire and sword to destroy thee. Thou seest all his
          attributes like heavy pieces of ordnance, all pointed at thee and
          ready to be discharged. Oh that thou mayest find a refuge in Christ!
          And oh! ye who never were convinced of sin, let me for one moment lay
          judgment to the line and righteousness to the plummet. Know ye this --
          perhaps ye laugh at it -- that all God's attributes are against you,
          if you are not in Christ! If you are not sheltered beneath the wings
          of Jesus, there is not one single glorious name of God, nor one
          celestial attribute, which does not curse you. What wouldst thou
          think, if at thy door to-night there should be planted great pieces of
          heavy cannon, all loaded, to be discharged against thee? But dost thou
          know, that where thou sittest to-night there are worse than heavy
          cannons to be discharged at thee? Yes, I see them, I see them! There
          is God's justice, and there is the angel of vengeance, standing with
          the match, ready to bid it hurl vengeance at thee. There is his power;
          there is his bare arm, ready to break thy bones, and crush thee into
          powder. There is his love, all blazing, turned to hate because thou
          hast rejected it; and there is his mercy, clad with mail, going forth
          like a warrior to overthrow thee. What sayest thou, O sinner,
          to-night? Against thee all God's attributes are pointed. He hath bent
          his bow and made it ready. The sword of the Lord has been bathed in
          heaven; it is bright and sharp; it is furbished. How wilt thou escape,
          when a mighty arm shall bring it down upon thee? or how wilt thou
          flee, when he shall draw his bow and shoot his arrows at thee, and
          make thee a mark for all the arrows of his vengeance? Beware, beware,
          ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to
          deliver! For tear you in pieces, he will yet, unless you shelter in
          the Rock of Ages, and wash yourselves in the stream of his wondrous
          blood. Fly to him, then, ye chief of sinners, fly. But if ye will not,
          now ye this, God is against you! He will plead against thee with his
          great power, unless thou hast our all-glorious Jesus to be thine
          advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And just one more hint here. The sinner, when he is labouring on
          account of guilt, feels that God would be just if he were to |plead
          against him with his great power?| |Oh,| saith he, |If I go to God in
          prayer, perhaps instead of hearing me he will crush me as I would a
          moth.| What, soul, would he be just if he did that? |Ay,| saith the
          sinner, |just, supremely just. Perhaps I shall have stripped myself of
          all my ornaments, and like a naked one have flown to him; perhaps then
          he will lash me harder than before, and I shall feel it all the worse
          for this my nakedness.| And will he be just, should the flagellation
          of his vengeance fall upon thy shoulders? |Yes,| he saith, |infallibly
          just.| And should he smite thee to the lowest hell, would he be just?
          |Yes,| saith the penitent, |just, infinitely just. I should have no
          word to say against him. I should feel that I deserved it all. My only
          question is, not whether he would be just to do it, but will he do
          it?| |Will he plead against me with his great power?| This is the
          question of fear. Some here, perhaps, are asking that question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let them hear the reply of faith; God give them a good
          deliverance!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. THE REPLY OF FAITH IS, |No.| O sinner, hear that word, |No;| there
          are sonnets condensed into it. |Will he plead against me with his
          great power?| |No, no,| say the saints in heaven; |no,| say the
          faithful on earth; |no,| say the promises; |no,| unanimously exclaim
          the oracles of Scripture; no, most emphatically no, he will not plead
          against you with his great power, but he will put strength into you.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. And here we make a similar remark to that with which we commenced
          the former part of the sermon, namely, this: the fearful soul has a
          very right view of God in many respects, but the faithful soul has a
          right view of God in all respects. He that hath faith in God knows
          more of God better than any man. Why, if I believe God, I can see all
          his attributes vindicated. I can see the wrath of justice expiated by
          yonder bleeding sufferer on the accursed tree. I can see his mercy and
          his justice joining hands with his wrath. I can see his power now
          turned on my behalf, and no longer against me. I can see his
          faithfulness become the guardian of my soul instead of the slaughterer
          of my hopes. I can see all his attributes standing, each of them
          conjoined, each of them glorious, each of them lovely, and all united
          in the work of man's salvation. He that feareth God, knows half of
          God; he that believeth God, knoweth all of God that he can know; and
          the more he believeth God, the more he understandeth God, the more he
          comprehendeth his glory, his character, his nature, and his
          attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The next thing is, that the believer when he is brought into peace
          with God does not tremble at the thought of God's power. He does not
          ask, |Will he plead against me with his great power?| But he says,
          |No, that very power, once my terror, and fear, is now my refuge and
          my hope, for he shall put that very power in me. I rejoice that God is
          Almighty, for he will lend me his omnipotence -- 'he will put strength
          into me.'| Now, here is a great thought; if I had power to handle it,
          it would give me opportunity indeed to preach to you. But I cannot
          reach the heights of eloquence, I shall therefore simply exhibit the
          thought for a moment to you. The very power which would have damned my
          soul, saves my soul. The very power that would have crushed me, God
          puts into me, that the work of salvation may be accomplished. No, he
          will not use it to crush me, but he will put that very strength into
          me. Dost see there the Mighty One upon his throne? Dread Sovereign, I
          see thine awful arm. What, wilt thou crush the sinner? Wilt thou
          utterly destroy him with thy strength? |No,| saith he, |Come hither,
          child.| And if you go to his Almighty throne, |There,| saith he |that
          self-same arm which made thee quake, see there, I give it to thee. Go
          out and live. I have made thee mighty as I am, to do my works; I will
          put strength into thee. The same strength which would have broken thee
          to pieces on the wheel shall now be put into thee, that thou mayest do
          mighty works.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I will show you how this great strength displays itself.
          Sometimes it goes out in prayer. Did you ever hear a man pray in whom
          God had put strength? You have heard some of us poor puny souls pray,
          I dare say; but have you ever heard a man pray that God had made into
          a giant? Oh, if you have, you will say it is a mighty thing to hear
          such a man in supplication. I have seen him now and then slip in his
          wrestling; but, like a giant, he has recovered his footing, and seemed
          like Jacob, to hurl the angel to the ground. I have marked the many
          lay hold upon the throne of mercy, and declare, |Lord, I will never
          let go, except thou bless me.| I have seen him, when heaven's gates
          have been apparently barred, go up to them, and say, |Ye gates, open
          wide in Jesus' name;| and I have seen the gates fly open before him,
          as if the man were God himself; for he is armed with God Almighty's
          strength. I have seen that man, in prayer, discover some great
          mountain in his hills and made them like chaff, by the immensity of
          his might. Some of you think I am talking enthusiasm; but such cases
          have been, and are now. Oh! to have heard Luther pray! Luther, you
          know, when Melancthon was dying, went to his death-bed, and said,
          |Melancthon, you shall not die!| |Oh,| said Melancthon, |I must die!
          It is a world of toil and trouble,| |Melancthon,| said he, |I have
          need of thee, and God's cause has need of thee, and as my name is
          Luther, thou shalt not die!| The physician said he would. Well, down
          went Luther on his knees, and began to tug at death. Old death
          struggled mightily for Melancthon, and he had got him well nigh on his
          shoulders. |Drop him,| said Luther, |drop him, I want him.| |No,| said
          death, |he is my prey, I will take him!| |Down with him,| said Luther,
          |down with him, death, or I will wrestle with thee!| And he seemed to
          take hold of the grim monster, and hurl him to the ground; and he came
          off victorious, like an Orpheus, with his wife, up from the very
          shades of death; he had delivered Melancthon from death by prayer!
          |Oh,| say you, |that is an extraordinary case.| No, beloved, not
          one-half so extraordinary as you dream. I have men and women here who
          have done the same in other cases; that have asked a thing of God, and
          have had it; that have been to the throne, and showed a promise, and
          said they would not come away without its fulfilment, and have come
          back fro God's throne conquerors of the Almighty; for prayer moves the
          arm that moves the world. |Prayer is the sinew of God,| said one, |it
          moves his arm;| and so it is. Verily, in prayer, with the strength of
          the faithful heart, there is a beautiful fulfilment of the text, |He
          will put strength in me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          A second illustration. Not only in prayer, but in duty, the man who
          has great faith in God, and whom God has girded with strength, how
          gigantic does he become! Have you never read of those great heroes who
          put to flight whole armies, and scattered kings like the snow on
          Salmon? Have you never read of those men that were fearless of foes,
          and stalked onward before all their opposers, as if they would as soon
          die as live? I read, this day, of a case in the old kirk of Scotland,
          before that King James who wished to force the black prelacy upon
          them. Andrew Melville and some of his associates were deputed to wait
          upon the king, and as they were going with a scroll ready written,
          they were warned to take care and return, for their lives were at
          stake. They paused a moment, and Andrew said, |I am not afraid, thank
          God, nor feeble-spirited in the cause and message of Christ; come what
          pleases God to send, our commission shall be executed.| At these words
          the deputation took courage, and went forward. On reaching the palace,
          and having obtained an audience, they found his majesty attended by
          Lennox and Arran, and several other lords, all of whom were English.
          They presented their remonstrance. Arran lifted it from the table, and
          glancing over it, he then turned to the ministers, and furiously
          demanded, |Who dares sign these treasonable articles?| |WE DARE.| said
          Andrew Melville, |and will render our lives in the cause.| Having thus
          spoken, he came forward to the table, took the pen, subscribed his
          name, and was followed by his brethren. Arran and Lennox were
          confounded; the king looked on in silence, and the nobles in surprise.
          Thus did our good forefathers appear before kings, and yet were not
          ashamed. |The proud had them greatly in derision, yet they declined
          not from the law of God.| Having thus discharged their duty, after a
          brief conference, the ministers were permitted to depart in peace. The
          king trembled more at them than if a whole army had been at his gates;
          and why was this? It was because God had put his own strength into
          them, to make them masters of their duty. And you have some such in
          your midst now. Despised they may be; but God has made them like the
          lion-like men of David, who would go down into the pit in the depth of
          winter, and take the lion by the throat and slay him. We have some in
          our churches -- but a remnant, I admit -- who are not afraid to serve
          their God, like Abdiel, |faithful amongst the faithless found.| We
          have some who are superior to the customs of the age, and scorn to bow
          at mammon's knee, who will not use the trimming language of too many
          modern ministers, but stand out for God's gospel, and the pure white
          banner of Christ, unstained and unsullied by the doctrines of men.
          Then are they mighty! Why they are mighty is, because God has put
          strength in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, some say, I have dealt with extraordinary cases. Come then, now
          we will have a home-case, one of your own sort, that will be like
          yourselves. Did you ever stand and take a view of heaven? Have you
          discerned the hills which lie between your soul and paradise? Have you
          counted the lions you have to fight, the giants to be slain, and the
          rivers to be crossed? Did you ever notice the many temptations with
          which you must be beset, the trials you have to endure, the
          difficulties you have to overcome, the dangers you have to avoid? Did
          you ever take a bird's-eye view of heaven, and all the dangers which
          are strewn thickly along the path thither? And didst thou ever ask
          thyself this question, |How shall I, a poor feeble worm, ever get
          there?| Didst thou ever say within thyself, |I am not a match for all
          my foes, how shall I arrive at paradise?| If thou hast ever asked this
          question, I will tell thee what is the only answer for it: thou must
          be girded with Almighty strength, or else thou wilt never gain the
          victory. Easy thy path may be, but it is too hard for thy infantile
          strength, without the Almighty power. Thy path may be one of little
          temptation, and of shallow trial; but thou wilt be drowned in the
          floods yet, unless Almighty power preserve thee. Mark me! however
          smooth thy way, there is nothing short of the bare arm of Deity that
          can land any one of you in heaven. We must have Divine strength, or
          else we shall never get there. And there is an illustration of these
          words: |No, but he will put his strength in me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |And shall I hold on to the end?| says the believer. Yes, thou wilt,
          for God's strength is in thee. |Shall I be able to bear such-and-such
          a trial?| Yes, thou wilt. Cannot Omnipotence stem the torrent? And
          Omnipotence is in thee; for, like Ignatius of old, thou art a
          God-bearer; thou bearest God about with thee. Thy heart is a temple of
          the Holy Ghost, and thou shalt yet overcome. |But can I ever stand
          firm in such-and-such evil day?| Oh! yes you will, for he will put his
          strength in you. I was in company, some time ago, with some ministers;
          one of them observed, |Brother, if there were to be stakes in
          Smithfield again, I am afraid they would find very few to burn among
          us.| |Well,| I said, |I do not know anything about how you would burn;
          but this I know right well, that there never will be any lack of men
          who are ready to die for Christ.| |Oh!| said he, |but they are not the
          right sort of men.| |Well,| said I, |but do you think they are the
          Lord's children?| |Yes, I believe they are, but they are not the right
          sort.| |Ah!| said I, |but you would find them the right sort, if they
          came to the test every one of them; they have not got burning grace
          yet. What would be the use of it?| We do not want the grace till the
          stakes come; but we should have burning grace in burning moments. If
          now, to-night, a hundred of us were called to die for Christ, I
          believe there would not only be found a hundred, but five hundred,
          that would march to death, and sing all the way. Whenever I find
          faith, I believe that God will put strength into the man; and I never
          think anything to be impossible to a man with faith in God, while it
          is written, |He will put strength in me.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But now the last observation shall be, we shall all want this at
          the last; and it is a mercy for us that this is written, for never
          shall we require it, perhaps, more than then. O believer, dost thou
          think thou wilt be able to swim the Jordan with thine own sinews?
          Caesar could not swim the Tiber, accoutered as he was; and dost thou
          hope to swim the Jordan with thy flesh about thee? No, thou wilt sink
          then, unless Jesus, as Aeneas did Anchises, from the flames of Rome,
          upon his shoulders, lift thee from Jordan, and carry thee across the
          stream, thou wilt never be able to walk across the river; thou wilt
          ne'er be able to face that tyrant and smile in his face, unless thou
          hast something more than mortal. Thou wilt need then to be belted
          about with the girdle of divinity, or else thy loins will be loosed,
          and thy strength will fail thee, when thou needst it most. Many a man
          has ventured to the Jordan in his own strength; but oh! how he has
          shrieked and howled, when the first wave has touched his feet! But
          never weakling went to death with God within him, but he found himself
          mightier than the grace. Go on, Christian, for this is thy promise.
          |He will put strength in me.|
        </p>
        <p>|Weak, though I am, yet through his might,</p>
        <p>I all things can perform.|</p>
        <p>
          Go on; dread not God's power, but rejoice at this, he will put his
          strength in you; he will not use his power to crush you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just one word, and then farewell. There is within reach of my voice, I
          am thoroughly convinced, one who is seeking Christ, whose only fear is
          this: |Sir, I would, but I cannot pray; I would, but I cannot believe;
          I would, but I cannot love; I would, but I cannot repent.| Oh! hear
          this, soul: |He will put his strength in thee.| Go home; and down on
          thy knees; if thou canst not pray, groan; if thou canst not groan,
          weep; if thou canst not weep, feel; if thou canst not feel, feel
          because thou canst not feel; for that is as far as many get. But stop
          there, mark you, stop there, and he will give you his blessing; do not
          get up till you have got the blessing. Go there in all thy weakness;
          if you do not feel it, say, |Lord, I do not feel as I ought to feel;
          but oh that I could! Lord, I cannot repent, as I would repent -- oh
          that thou wouldst help me!| |Oh! sir,| you say, |but I could not go so
          far as that, for I don't think I have got a strong desire.| Go and
          say, |Lord I would desire; help me to desire.| And then sit down and
          think of your lost estate. Think of your ruin and the remedy, and muse
          on that; and mark thee, whilst thou art in the way, the Lord will meet
          with thee. Only believe this, that if thou triest Christ he will never
          let thee try in vain. Go and risk thy soul on Christ to-night, neck or
          nothing, sinner. Go now, break or make; go and say, |Lord, I know I
          must be damned if I have not Christ.| Stay there, and say, |If I
          perish, I perish only here;| and I tell you, you will never perish. I
          am bondsman for God. This head to the block if your soul goes to hell,
          if you pray sincerely and trust Christ. This neck to the gallows,
          again I say, this neck to the rope and to the hangman's gallows, if
          Christ reject you after your have earnestly sought him. Only try that,
          I beseech thee, poor soul. |Oh,| you say, |but I have not strength
          enough; I cannot do that.| Well, poor soul, crawl to the mercy-seat,
          and there lie flat, just as you are. You know that misery often speaks
          when it utters not a word. The poor mendicant squats himself down in
          the street. He says nothing, There protrudes a ragged knee, and there
          is a wounded hand. He says nothing; but with his hands folded on his
          breast he looks at every passer-by; and though not a word is spoken,
          he winneth more than if he daily drawled out his tale, or sung it
          along the street. So do thou sit like Bartimeus by the way-side
          begging; and if thou hearest him pass by, then cry, |Jesus, thou son
          of David, have mercy upon me.| But if thou canst scarce say that, sit
          there, and exhibit thy poor wounds; tell the Lord thy desperate
          condition; strip thy loathsome sores, and let the Almighty see the
          venom. Turn out thy heart, and let the rank corruption be all
          inspected by the Almighty eye. |And he hath mercies rich and free.|
          Who can tell, poor sinner, who can tell? He may look on thee.
        </p>
        <p>|Jesus died upon the tree,</p>
        <p>And why, poor sinner, not for thee?</p>
        <p>His Sovereign grace is rich and free,</p>
        <p>And why, poor sinner, not for thee?</p>
        <p>|Our Jesus loved and saved me,</p>
        <p>Say why, poor sinner, why not thee?|</p>
        <p>
          Only do this; and if thou art a sinner, hear this: |This is a faithful
          saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Jesus Christ came into the
          world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.| He will not |Plead against
          you with his great power; no, he will put his strength in you!| The
          Lord dismiss you with his blessing!<br />
