        <p>A Heavenly Pattern for Our Earthly Life</p>
        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1778)</p>
        <p>Preached on Wednesday Morning, April 30th, 1884, By</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At Exeter-Hall</p>
        <p>Being the Annual Sermon of the Baptist Missionary Society.</p>
        <p>|Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.| -- Matthew 6:10.</p>
        <p>
          OUR Father's will shall certainly be done, for the Lord |doeth
          according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants
          of the earth.| Let us adoringly consent that it shall be so, desiring
          no alteration therein. That |will| may cost us dear; yet let it never
          cross our wills: let our minds be wholly subjugated to the mind of
          God. That |will| may bring us bereavement, sickness, and loss; but let
          us learn to say, |It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.|
          We should not only yield to the divine will, but acquiesce in it so as
          to rejoice in the tribulation which it ordains. This is a high
          attainment, but we set ourselves to reach it. He that taught us this
          prayer used it himself in the most unrestricted sense. When the bloody
          sweat stood on his face, and all the fear and trembling of a man in
          anguish were upon him, he did not dispute the decree of the Father,
          but bowed his head and cried, |Nevertheless, not as I will, but as
          thou wilt.| When we are called to suffer bereavements personally, or
          when, as a holy brotherhood, we see our best men taken away, let us
          know that it is well, and say most sincerely, |The will of the Lord be
          done.|
        </p>
        <p>
          God knows what will best minister to his gracious designs. To us it
          seems a sad waste of human life that man after man should go to a
          malarious region, and perish in the attempt to save the heathen: but
          infinite wisdom may view the matter very differently. We ask why the
          Lord does not work a miracle, and cover the heads of his messengers
          from the death shaft? No reason is revealed to us, but there is a
          reason, for the will of the great Father is the sum of wisdom. Reasons
          are not made known to us, else were there no scope for our faith; and
          the Lord loves that this noble grace should have ample room and verge
          enough. Our God wastes no consecrated life: he has made nothing in
          vain: he ordains all things according to the counsel of his will, and
          that counsel never errs. Could the Lord endow us with his own
          omniscience, we should not only consent to the deaths of his servants,
          but should deprecate their longer life. The same would also be true of
          our own living or dying. |Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
          death of his saints|; and therefore we are sure that he does not
          afflict us by bereavement without a necessity of love. We must still
          see one missionary after another cut down in his prime; for there are
          arguments with God, as convincing with him as they are obscure to us,
          which require that by heroic sacrifice the foundations of the African
          church should be laid. Lord, we do not ask thee to explain thy reasons
          to us. Thou canst screen us from a great temptation by hiding thyself;
          for if even now we sin by asking reasons, we might soon go further,
          and provoke thee sorely by contending against thy reasons. He who
          demands a reason of God is not in a fit state to receive one. In the
          case of the honoured men whom the Lord has removed from us this year,
          there is assuredly no loss to the great cause as it is viewed by the
          eye of God. See the great stones and costly stones laboriously brought
          from the quarry to the edge of the sea! Can it be possible that these
          are deliberately thrown into the deep? It swallows them up! Wherefore
          is so much labour thrown away? These living stones might surely have
          been built into a temple for the Lord; why should the waves of death
          engulf them? Yet more are sought for, and still more: will the hungry
          abyss never cease to devour? Alas, that so much precious material
          should be lost! It is not lost. No, not a stone of it. Thus the Lord
          layeth the foundation of his harbour of refuge among the people.
          |Mercy shall be built up for ever.| In due time massive walls shall
          rise out of the deep, and we shall no longer ask the reason for the
          losses of early days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peace be to the memories of the heroic dead! Men die that the cause
          may live. |Father, thy will be done.| With this prayer upon our lips
          let us bend low in child-like submission to the will of the great
          Jehovah, and then gird up our loins anew to dauntless perseverance in
          our holy service. Though more should be taken away next year, and the
          next, yet we must pray on, |Thy will be done in earth as it is in
          heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          My heart is grieved for the death of beloved hartley, and those noble
          men who preceded him to |the white man's grave.| I had seen him
          especially, for it had been a joy to assist him for three years in
          preparing for missionary service. Alas! the preparation led to small
          visible results. He left us, he landed, and he died. Surely the Lord
          means to make further use of him; if he did not make him a preacher to
          the natives, he must intend that he should preach to us. I may say of
          each fallen missionary, |He being dead yet speaketh.| |Faithful unto
          death,| they inspire us by their example. Dying without regret in the
          cause of such a Master, they remind us of our own indebtedness to him.
          Their spirits rising to his throne are links between this Society and
          the glorified assembly above. Let not our thoughts go downward to
          their graves, but rise upward to their thrones. Does not our text
          point with a finger of flame from earth to heaven? Do not the dear
          departed ones mark a line of light between the two worlds?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the prayer of our text had not been dictated by the Lord Jesus
          himself, we might think it too bold. Can it ever be that this earth, a
          mere drop of a bucket, should touch the great sea of life and light
          above and not be lost in it? Can it remain earth and yet be made like
          to heaven? Will it not lost its individuality in the process? This
          earth is subject to vanity, dimmed with ignorance, defiled with sin,
          furrowed with sorrow; can holiness dwell in it as in heaven? Our
          Divine Instructor would not teach us to pray for impossibilities; he
          puts such petitions into our mouths as can be heard and answered. Yet
          certainly this is a great prayer; it has the hue of the infinite about
          it. Can earth be tuned to the harmonies of heaven? Has not this poor
          planet drifted too far away to be reduced to order and made to keep
          rank with heaven? Is it not swathed in mist too dense to be removed?
          Can its grave-clothes be loosed? Can thy will, O God, be done in earth
          as it is in heaven? It can be, and it must be; for a prayer wrought in
          the soul by the Holy Spirit is ever the shadow of a coming blessing,
          and he that taught us to pray after this manner did not mock us with
          vain words. It is a brave prayer, which only heaven-born faith can
          utter; yet it is not the offspring of presumption, for presumption
          never longs for the will of the Lord to be perfectly performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. May the Holy Spirit be with us, while I first lead you to observe
          that THE COMPARISON IS NOT FAR FETCHED. That our present obedience to
          God should be like to that of holy ones above is not a strained and
          fanatical notion. It is not far-fetched, for earth and heaven were
          called into being by the same Creator. The empire of the Maker
          comprehends the upper and the lower regions. |The heaven, even the
          heavens are the Lord's|; and |the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
          thereof.| He sustaineth all things by the word of his power both in
          heaven above and in the earth beneath. Jesus reigneth both among
          angels and men, for he is the Lord of all. If, then, heaven and earth
          were created by the same God, and are sustained by the same power, and
          governed from the same throne, we believe that the same end will be
          subserved by each of them, and that both heaven and earth shall tell
          out the glory of God. They are two bells of the same chime, and this
          is the music that peals forth from them: |The Lord shall reign for
          ever and ever. Hallelujah!| If earth were of the devil and heaven were
          of God, and two self-existent powers were contending for the mastery,
          we might question whether earth would ever be as pure as heaven; but
          as our ears have twice heard the divine declaration, |Power belongeth
          unto God,| we expect to see that power triumphant, and the dragon cast
          out from earth as well as heaven. Why should not every part of the
          great Creator's handiwork become equally radiant with his glory? He
          that made can remake. The curse which fell upon the ground was not
          eternal; thorns and thistles pass away. God will bless the earth for
          Christ's sake even as once he cursed it for man's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.| It was so once.
          Perfect obedience to the heavenly upon this earth will only be a
          return to the good old times which ended at the gate of Eden. There
          was a day when no gulf was digged between earth and heaven; there was
          scarce a boundary line, for the God of heaven walked in Paradise with
          Adam. All things on earth were then pure, and true, and happy. It was
          the garden of the Lord. Alas, that the trail of the serpent has now
          defiled everything. Then earth's morning song was heard in heaven, and
          heaven's hallelujahs floated down to earth at eventide. Those who
          desire to set up the kingdom of God are not instituting a new order of
          things; they are restoring, not inventing. Earth will drop into the
          old groove again. The Lord is king: and he has never left the throne.
          As it was in the beginning so shall it be yet again. History shall, in
          the divinest sense, repeat itself. The temple of the Lord shall be
          among men, and the Lord God shall dwell among them. |Truth shall
          spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from
          heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.| It will be so at the
          last. I shall not venture far into prophecy. Some brethren are quite
          at home where I should lose myself. I have scarcely yet been able to
          get out of the gospels and the epistles; and that deep book of
          Revelation, with its waters to swim in, I must leave to better
          instructed minds. |Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the
          prophecy of that book;| to that blessing I would aspire, but I cannot
          yet make claim to interpret it. This much, however, seems plain, --
          there is to be |a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
          righteousness.| This creation, which now |groaneth and travaileth in
          pain,| in sympathy with man, is to be brought forth from its bondage
          into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Blessed be the Lord
          Jesus, when he brought his people out of their bondage, he did not
          redeem their spirits only, but their bodies also: hence their material
          part is the Lord's as well as their spiritual nature, and hence again
          this very earth which we inhabit shall be uplifted in connection with
          us. The creation itself shall be delivered. Materialism, out of which
          there has been once made a vesture for the Godhead in the person of
          Christ, shall become a fit temple for the Lord of hosts. The New
          Jerusalem shall come down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
          is prepared for her husband. We are sure of this. Therefore unto this
          consummation let us strive mightily, praying evermore, |Thy will be
          done in earth, as it is in heaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, remember also that there is an analogy between earth and
          heaven, so that the one is the type of the other. You could not
          describe heaven except by borrowing the things of earth to symbolize
          it; and this shows that there is a real likeness between them. What is
          heaven? It is Paradise, or a garden. Walk amid your fragrant flowers
          and think of heaven's bed of spices. Heaven is a kingdom: thrones, and
          crowns, and palms are the earthly emblems of the heavenlies. Heaven is
          a city; and there, again, you fetch your metaphor from the
          dwelling-places of men. It is a place of |many mansions| -- the homes
          of the glorified. Houses are of earth, yet is God our dwelling-place.
          Heaven is a wedding-feast; and even such is this present dispensation.
          The tables are spread here as well as there; and it is our privilege
          to go forth and bring in the hedge-birds and the highwaymen, that the
          banqueting-hall may be filled. While the saints above eat bread in the
          marriage supper of the Lamb, we do the like below in another sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between earth and heaven there is but a thin partition. The home
          country is much nearer than we think. I question if |the land that is
          very far off| be a true name for heaven. Was it not an extended
          kingdom on earth which was intended by the prophet rather than the
          celestial home? Heaven is by no means the far country, for it is the
          Father's house. Are we not taught to say, |Our Father which art in
          heaven|? Where the Father is the true spirit of adoption counts itself
          near. Our Lord would have us mingle heaven with earth by naming it
          twice in this short prayer. See how he makes us familiar with heaven
          by mentioning it next to our usual food, making the next petition to
          be, |Give us this day our daily bread.| This does not look as if it
          should be thought of as a remote region. Heaven, is at any rate, so
          near that in a moment we can speak with him that is King of the place,
          and he will answer to our call. Yea, before the clock shall tick again
          you and I may be there. Can that be a far-off country which we can
          reach so soon? Oh, brothers, we are within hearing of the shining
          ones; we are well-nigh home. A little while and we shall see our Lord.
          Perhaps another day's march will bring us within the city gate. And
          what if another fifty years of life on earth should remain, what is it
          but the twinkling of an eye?
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear enough is it that the comparison between the obedience of earth
          and that of heaven is not far-fetched. If heaven and heaven's God be,
          in truth, so near to us, our Lord has set before us a homely model
          taken from our heavenly dwelling-place. The petition only means -- let
          all the children of the one Father be alike in doing his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, THIS COMPARISON IS EMINENTLY INSTRUCTIVE. Does it not
          teach us that what we do for God is not everything, but how we do it
          is also to be considered? The Lord Jesus Christ would not only have us
          do the Father's will, but do it after a certain model. And what an
          elevated model it is! Yet is it none too elevated, for we would not
          wish to render to our heavenly Father service of an inferior kind. If
          none of us dare say that we are perfect, we are yet resolved that we
          will never rest until we are. If none of us dare hope that even our
          holy things are without a flaw, yet none of us will be satisfied while
          a spot remains upon them. We would give to our God the utmost
          conceivable glory. Let the mark be as high as possible. If we do not
          as yet reach it, we will aim higher and yet higher. We do not desire
          that our pattern should be lowered, but that our imitation should be
          raised.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.| Mark the words |be
          done,| for they touch a vital point of the text. God's will is done in
          heaven. How very practical! On earth his will is often forgotten, and
          his rule ignored. In the church of the present age there is a desire
          to be doing something for God, but few enquire what he wills them to
          do. Many things are done for the evangelizing of the people which were
          never commanded by the great Head of the Church, and cannot be
          approved of by him. Can we expect that he will accept or bless that
          which he has never commanded? Will-worship is as sin in his sight. We
          are to do his will in the first place, and then to expect a blessing
          upon the doing of that will. My brethren, I am afraid that Christ's
          will on earth is very much more discussed than done. I have heard of
          brethren spending days in disputing upon a precept which their dispute
          was breaking. In heaven they have no disputes, but they do the will of
          God without discord. We are best employed when we are actually doing
          something for this fallen world, and for the glory of our Lord. |Thy
          will be done|: we must come to actual works of faith and labours of
          love. Too often we are satisfied with having approved of that will, or
          with having spoken of it in words of commendation. But we must not
          stay in thought, resolve, or word; the prayer is practical and
          business-like, |Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.| An
          idle man stretched himself on his bed when the sun had risen high in
          heaven, and as he rolled over, he muttered to himself that he wished
          this were hard work, for he could do any quantity of it with pleasure.
          Many might wish that to think and to speak were to do the will of God;
          for them they would have effected it very thoroughly. Up yonder there
          is no playing with sacred things: they do his commandments, hearkening
          unto the voice of his word. Would God his will were not alone preached
          and sung below, but actually done as it is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          In heaven the will of God is done in spirit, for they are spirits
          there. It is done in truth with undivided heart, and unquestioned
          desire. On earth, too often, it is done and yet not done; for a dull
          formality mocks real obedience. Here obedience often shades off into
          dreary routine. We sing with the lips, but our hearts are silent. We
          pray as if the mere utterance of words were prayer. We sometimes
          preach living truth with dead lips. It must no longer be so. Would God
          we had the fire and fervour of those burning ones who behold the face
          of God. We pray in that sense, |Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
          heaven.| I hope there is a revival of spiritual life among us, and
          that, to a large extent, our brotherhood is instinct with fervour; but
          there is room for far more zeal. Ye that know how to pray, go down
          upon your knees, and with the warm breath of prayer arouse the spark
          of spiritual life until it becomes a flame. With all the powers of our
          innermost being, with the whole life of God within us, let us be
          stirred up to do the will of the Lord on earth as it is done in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          In heaven they do God's will constantly, without failure. Would God it
          could be so here! We are aroused to-day, but we fall asleep tomorrow.
          We are diligent for one hour, but sluggish the next. This must not be,
          dear friends. We must be steadfast, unmovable -- always abounding in
          the work of the Lord. We need to pray for sacred perseverance, that we
          may imitate the days of heaven upon the earth by doing the Lord's will
          without a break.
        </p>
        <p>
          They do God's will in heaven universally, without making a selection.
          Here men pick and choose -- take this commandment to be obeyed, and
          lay that commandment by as non-essential. We are, I fear, all
          tinctured, more or less, with this odious gall. A certain part of
          obedience is hard, and therefore we try to forget it. It must no
          longer be so; but whatsoever Jesus saith unto us we must do. Partial
          obedience is actual disobedience. The loyal subject respects the whole
          law. If anything be the will of the Lord, we have no choice in the
          matter, the choice is made by our Lord. Let us pray that we may
          neither misunderstand the Lord's will, nor forget it, nor violate it.
          Perhaps we are, as a company of believers, ignorantly omitting a part
          of the Lord's will, and this may have been hindering our work these
          many years; possibly there is something written by the pen of
          inspiration which we have not read, or something read that we have not
          practised; and this may hold back the arm of the Lord from working. We
          should often make diligent search, and go through our churches to see
          wherein we differ from the divine pattern. Some goodly Babylonish
          garment or wedge of gold may be as an accursed thing in the camp,
          bringing disaster to the Lord's armies. Let us not neglect anything
          which our God commands lest he withhold his blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          His will is done in heaven instantly, and without hesitation. We, I
          fear, are given to delays. We plead that we must look the thing round
          about. |Second thoughts are best,| we say, whereas the first thoughts
          of eager love are the prime production of our being. I would that we
          were obedient at all hazard, for therein lies the truest safety. Oh,
          to do what God bids us, as God bids us, on the spot, and at the
          moment! It is not ours to debate, but to perform. Let us dedicate
          ourselves as perfectly as Esther consecrated herself when she espoused
          the cause of her people, and said, |If I perish, I perish.| We must
          not consult with flesh and blood, or make a reserve for our own
          selfishness, but at once most vigorously follow the divine command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us pray the Lord that we may do his will on earth as it is done in
          heaven; that is, joyfully, without the slightest weariness. When our
          hearts are right, it is a glad thing to serve God, though it be only
          to unloose the latchets of our Master's shoes. To be employed by Jesus
          in service which will bring us no repute, but much reproach, should be
          our delight. If we were altogether as we should be, sorrow for
          Christ's sake would be joy: ay, we should have joy right along, in
          dark nights as well as in bright days. Even as they are glad in
          heaven, with a felicity born of the presence of the Lord, so should we
          be glad, and find our strength in the joy of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          In heaven the will of the Lord is done right humbly. There perfect
          purity is set in a frame of lowliness. Too often we fall into
          self-gratulation, and it defiles our best deeds. We whisper to
          ourselves, |I did that very well.| We flatter ourselves that there was
          no self in our conduct, but while we are laying that flattering
          unction to our souls, we are lying, as our self-contentment proves.
          God might have allowed us to do ten times as much, had he not known
          that it would not be safe. He cannot set us upon the pinnacle, because
          our heads are weak, and we grow dizzy with pride. We must not be
          permitted to be rulers over many things, for we should become tyrants
          if we had the opportunity. Brother, pray the Lord to keep thee low at
          his feet, for in no other place canst thou be largely used of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comparison being thus instructive, I pray that we may be the
          better for our meditation upon it. I do not find it an easy thing even
          to describe the model; but if we essay to copy it: |this is the work;
          this is the difficulty.| Unless we are girded with the divine strength
          we shall never do the will of God as it is done in heaven. Here is a
          greater labour than those of Hercules, bringing with it victories
          nobler than those of Alexander. To this the unaided wisdom of Solomon
          could not attain; the Holy Ghost must transform us, and lead the
          earthly in us captive to the heavenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, I beg you to notice, dear friends, that THIS COMPARISON
          of holy service on earth to that which is in heaven, IS BASED UPON
          FACTS. The facts will both comfort and stimulate us. Two places are
          mentioned in the text which seems very dissimilar, and yet the
          likeness exceeds the unlikeness -- earth and heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why should not saints do the will of the Lord on earth as their
          brethren do it in heaven? What is heaven but the Father's house,
          wherein there are many mansions? Do we not abide in that house even
          now? The Psalmist said, |Blessed are they that dwell in thy house,
          they will be still praising thee.| Have we not often said of our
          Bethels, |This is none other but the house of God, and this is the
          gate of heaven|? The spirit of adoption causes us to be at home with
          God even while we sojourn here below. Let us therefore do the will of
          God at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have the same fare on earth as the saints in heaven, for |the Lamb
          in the midst of the throne doth feed them:| he is the Shepherd of his
          flock below, and daily feeds us upon himself. His flesh is meat
          indeed, his blood is drink indeed. Whence come the refreshing draughts
          of the immortals? The Lamb doth lead them to living fountains of
          waters; and doth he not even here below say to us, |If any man thirst,
          let him come unto me, and drink|? The same river of the water of life
          which makes glad the city of our God above, also waters the garden of
          the Lord below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, we are in the same company below as they enjoy above. Up
          there they are with Christ, and here he is with us, for he hath said
          -- |Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.| There is
          a difference as to the brightness of his presence; but not as to the
          reality of it. Thus you see we are partakers of the same privileges as
          the shining ones within the city gates. The church below is a chamber
          of the one great house, and the partition which separates it from the
          church above is a mere veil, of inconceivable thinness. Wherefore
          should we not do the Lord's will on earth as it is done in heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          |But heaven is a place of peace,| says one; |there they rest from
          their labours.| Beloved, our estate here is not without its peace and
          rest. |Alas,| cries one, |I find it far otherwise.| I know it. But
          whence come wars and fightings but of our fretfulness and unbelief?
          |We which have believed do enter into rest.| That is not in all
          respects a fair allegory which represents us as crossing the Jordan of
          death to enter into Canaan. No, my brethren, believers are in Canaan
          now; how else could we say that the Canaanite is still in the land? We
          have entered upon the promised heritage, and we are warring for the
          full possession of it. We have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
          Lord. I for one do not feel like a lone dove flying over waters dark,
          seeking rest for the sole of her foot. No, I have found my Noah: Jesus
          has given me rest. There is a difference between the best estate of
          earth and the glory of heaven, but the rest which every soul may have
          that learns to conquer its will, is most deep and real. Brethren,
          having rest already, and being participators of the joy of the Lord,
          why should we not serve God on earth as they do in heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          |But we have not their victory,| cries one, |for they are more than
          conquerors.| Yes, and |our warfare is accomplished.| We have prophetic
          testimony to that fact. Moreover, |This is the victory that overcometh
          the world, even our faith.| In the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord giveth
          us the victory, and maketh us to triumph in every place. We are
          warring; but we are of good cheer, for Jesus has overcome the world,
          and we also overcome by his blood. Ever is this our war-cry, |Victory!
          Victory!| The Lord will tread Satan under our feet shortly. Why should
          we not do the Lord's will on earth as it is done in heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          Heaven is the place of fellowship with God, and this is a blessed
          feature in its joy; but in this we are now participators, for |Truly
          our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.| The
          fellowship of the Holy Ghost is with us all; it is our joy and our
          delight. Having communion with the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy
          Spirit, we are uplifted and sanctified, and it is becoming that by us
          the will of the Lord should be done on earth as it is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Up there,| says a brother, |they are all accepted, but here we are in
          a state of probation.| Did you read that in the Bible? for I never
          did. A believer is in no state of probation; he has passed from death
          unto life, and shall never come into condemnation. We are already
          |accepted in the Beloved,| and that acceptance is so given as never to
          be reversed. The Redeemer brought us up out of the horrible pit of
          probation, and he has set our feet on the rock of salvation, and there
          he has established our goings. |The righteous shall hold on his way,
          and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.|
          Wherefore should we not, as the accepted of the Lord, do his will on
          earth as it is in heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          |Ay,| saith one, |but heaven is the place of perfect service; for his
          servants shall serve him.'| But is not this the place, in some
          respects, of a more extensive service still? Are there not many things
          which perfect saints above and holy angels cannot do? If we had choice
          of a sphere in which we could serve God with widest range, we should
          choose not heaven but earth. There are no slums and over-crowded rooms
          in heaven to which we can go with help, but there are plenty of them
          here. There are no jungles and regions of malaria where missionaries
          may prove their unreserved consecration by preaching the gospel at the
          expense of their lives. In some respects this world has a preference
          beyond the heavenly state as to the extent of doing the will of God.
          Oh, that we were better men, and then the saints above might almost
          envy us! If we did but live as we should live, we might make Gabriel
          stoop from his throne and cry, |I wish I were a man!| It is ours to
          lead the van in daily conflict with sin and Satan, and at the same
          time ours to bring up the rear, battling with the pursuing foe. God
          help us, since we are honoured with so rare a sphere, to do his will
          on earth as it is done in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Ay,| say you, |but heaven is the place of overflowing joy.| Yes, and
          have you no joy even now? A saint who lives near to God is so truly
          blessed that he will not be much astonished when he enters heaven. he
          will be surprised to behold its glories more clearly; but he will have
          the same reason for delight as he possesses to-day. We live below the
          same life which we shall live above, for we are quickened by the same
          Spirit, are looking to the same Lord, and rejoicing in the same
          security. Joy! Do you not know it? Your Lord says, |That my joy might
          remain in you, and that your joy might be full.| You will be larger
          vessels in heaven, but you will not be fuller; you will be brighter,
          doubtless, but you will not be cleaner than you are when the Lord has
          washed you and made you white in his own blood. Do not be impatient to
          go to heaven. Nay, do not have a wish about it. Set very loose by the
          things of earth; yet count it a great privilege to have a long life in
          which to serve the Lord on earth. Our mortal life is but a brief
          interval between the two eternities, and if we judged unselfishly, and
          saw the needs of earth, we might almost say, |Give us back the
          antediluvian periods of human life, that through a chiliad we might
          serve the Lord in suffering and in reproach, as we cannot do in
          glory.| This life is the vestibule of glory. Array yourselves in the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ, for this is the court-dress of earth
          and heaven. Manifest at once the spirit of saints, or else you will
          never abide with them. Now begin the song which your lips shall carol
          in Paradise, or else you will never be admitted to the heavenly
          choirs; none can unite in the music but those who have rehearsed it
          here below.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Lastly, THIS COMPARISON, which I feel I can so feebly bring out,
          of doing the will of God on earth as it is done in heaven, OUGHT TO BE
          BORNE OUT BY HOLY DEEDS. Here is the urgency of the missionary
          enterprise. God's will can never be intelligently done where it is not
          known; therefore, in the first place, it becomes us as followers of
          Jesus to see to it that the will of the Lord is made known by heralds
          of peace sent forth from among us. Why has it not been already
          published in every land? We cannot blame the great Father, nor impute
          the fault to the Lord Jesus. The Spirit of the Lord is not straitened,
          nor the mercy of God restrained. Is it not probably true that the
          selfishness of Christians is the main reason for the slow progress of
          Christianity? If Christianity is never to spread in the world at a
          more speedy rate than the present, it will not even keep pace with the
          growth of the population. If we are going to give to Christ's kingdom
          no larger a percentage than we have usually given, I suppose it will
          require about an eternity-and-a-half to convert the world; or, in
          other words, it will never be done. The progress made is so slow, that
          it threatens to be like that of the crab, which is always described in
          the fable as going backward. What do we give, brethren? What do we do?
          A friend exhorts me to say that the Baptist Missionary Society ought
          to raise a million a-year. I have my doubts about that; but he
          proposes that we should, at least, try to do so for one year. There is
          nothing like having a high mark to aim at. A million a-year seems
          hugely too much by the general consent of you all, and yet I am not
          sure. What amount of property is now held by Baptists? The probable
          estimate of money now in the hands of baptized believers in the United
          Kingdom might make us ashamed that a million is not put down at once.
          Far more than that is spent by a similar number of Englishmen upon
          strong drink. We do not know how much wealth lies in the custody of
          God's stewards; and some of them are not likely to let us know until
          we read it in the paper, and then we shall discover that they died
          worth so many hundreds of thousands. The world counts men to be worth
          what they hoard; but in truth they were not worth much, or else they
          could not have retained so much from the work of the Lord when it was
          needed for the spread of the gospel. As a denomination we are
          improving a little. We are improving a little. I was obliged to repeat
          that sentence, and place the emphasis in the right place. We may not
          congratulate ourselves: considerable room for improvement yet remains:
          the income of the Society might be doubled and no one oppressed in the
          process. It is not for us to say, |Thy will be done on earth as it is
          in heaven: but, Lord. Thou hast many ways and means of accomplishing
          that will; I pray thee do it, but let me not be asked to help on the
          work.| No, when I utter this prayer, if I am sincere I shall be
          searching my stores to see what I can give to make known the truth. I
          shall be enquiring whether I cannot personally speak the saving word.
          I shall not decline to give because the times are very hard, neither
          shall I fail to speak because I am of a retiring disposition. An
          opportunity is a golden gift. Now, do not offer the prayer of the text
          if you do not mean it. Better omit the petition than play the
          hypocrite with it. You who fail to support missions when it is in your
          power to do so should never say, |Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,|
          but leave out that petition for fear of mocking God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text, dear friends, leads me to say that as God's will must be
          known that it may be done, it must be God's will that we should make
          it known; because God is love, and the law under which he has placed
          us is that we love. What love of God dwelleth in that man who denies
          to a benighted heathen that light without which he will be lost? Love
          is a grand word to talk of, but it is nobler as a principle to be
          obeyed. Can there be love of God in that man's heart who will not help
          to send the gospel to those who are without it? We want to bless the
          world; we have a thousand schemes by which to bless it, but if ever
          God's will is done in earth as it is done in heaven it will be an
          unmixed and comprehensive blessing. Join the Peace Society by all
          means, and be forgiving and peaceable yourself; but there is no way of
          establishing peace on the earth except by God's will being done in it,
          and that can only be done through the renewing of men's hearts by the
          gospel of Jesus Christ. By all manner of means let us endeavour so to
          control politics, as Christian men, that oppression shall not remain
          in the earth; but, after all, there will be oppression unless the
          gospel is spread. This is the one balm for all earth's wounds. They
          will bleed still until the Christ shall come to bind them up. Oh, let
          us then, since this is the best thing that can be, show our love to
          God and man by spreading his saving truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text says, |Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.|
          Suppose any one of you had come from heaven. It is but a supposition;
          but let it stand for a minute: suppose that a man here has come fresh
          from heaven. Some would be curious to see what his bodily form would
          be like. They would expect to be dazzled by the radiance of his
          countenance. However, we will let that pass. We want to see how he
          would live. Coming newly from heaven, how would he act? Oh, sirs, if
          he came here to do the same as all men do on earth, only after a
          heavenly sort, what a father he would be, what a husband, what a
          brother, what a friend! I would sit down and let him preach this
          morning, most assuredly; and when he had done preaching, I would go
          home with him, and have a chat. I should be very careful to observe
          what he would do with his substance. His first thought would be, if he
          had a shilling, to lay it out for God's glory. |But,| says one, |I
          have to go to shop with my shilling.| Be it so, but when you go say,
          |Oh! Lord, help me to lay it out to thy glory.| There should be as
          much piety in buying your necessaries as in going to a place of
          worship. I do not think this man coming fresh from heaven would say,
          |I must have this luxury; I must have this goodly raiment; I must have
          this grand house.| But he would say, |How much can I save for the God
          of heaven? How much can I invest in the country I came from?| I am
          sure he would be pinching and screwing to save money to serve God
          with; and he himself, as he went about the streets, and mingled with
          ungodly men and women, would be sure to find out ways of getting at
          their consciences and hearts; he would be always trying to bring
          others to the felicity he had enjoyed. Think that over, and live so --
          so as he did who really did come down from heaven. For after all, the
          best rule of life is, what would Jesus do if he were here to-day, and
          the world still lying in the wicked one? If Jesus were in your
          business, if he had your money, how would he spend it? For that is how
          you ought to spend it. Now think, my brother, you will be in heaven
          very soon. Since last year a great number have gone home: before next
          year many more will have ascended to glory. Sitting up in those
          celestial seats, how shall we wish that we had lived below? It will
          not give any man in heaven even a moment's joy to think that he
          gratified himself while here. It will give him no reflections suitable
          to the place to remember how much he amassed, how much he left behind
          to be quarrelled over after he was gone; he will say to himself, |I
          wish I had saved more of my capital by sending it on before me, for
          what I saved on earth was lost, but what I spent for God was really
          laid up where thieves do not break through and steal.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, brothers, let us live as we shall wish we had lived when life is
          over; let us fashion a life which will bear the light eternal. Is it
          life to live otherwise? Is it not a sort of fainting fit, a coma, out
          of which life may not quite have gone, but all that is worth calling
          life has oozed away? Unless we are striving mightily to honour Jesus,
          and bring home his banished, we are dead while we live. Let us aim at
          a life which will outlast the fires which shall try every man's work.

          If I may have moved any person here to resolve, |I will so live,| I
          have not spoken in vain. I have at least stirred myself with the
          intense desire to cast off the mere outsides and husks of life, and to
          ripen the real kernel of my being. Thy will by me be done on earth, as
          yet, my Lord, I hope to do it in the skies. May I begin here a life
          worthy to be perpetuated in eternity. God bless you, for Christ's
          sake. Amen.<br />
