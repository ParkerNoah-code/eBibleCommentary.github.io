The liberal soul shall be made fat: And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: But much increase is by the strength of the ox.</p><p>* * *</p><p>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p><p>* * *</p><p>It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Boast not thyself of tomorrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</p><p>* * *</p><p>As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him.</p><p>* * *</p><p>All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth them with words, but they are gone.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapour driven to and fro; They that seek them seek death.</p><p>* * *</p><p>As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, And as vinegar upon nitre, So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Wrath is cruel, And anger is outrageous: But who is able to stand before jealousy?</p><p>* * *</p><p>The fining pot is for silver, And the furnace for gold: And a man is tried by his praise.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Transitoriness of Riches</p><p>An Epigram</p><p>Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom; Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Hospitality of the Evil Eye</p><p>An Epigram</p><p>Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties; For as one that reckoneth within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words.</p><p>* * * A Maxim</p><p>My son, if thou comest to serve the Lord, Prepare thy soul for temptation.</p><p>Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of calamity. Cleave unto him, and depart not, that thou mayest be increased at thy latter end. Accept whatsoever is brought upon thee, and be longsuffering when thou passest into humiliation. For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. Put thy trust in him, and he will help thee: order thy ways aright, and set thy hope on him. * * *</p><p>Three Temperance Maxims</p><p>Go not after thy lusts; And refrain thyself from thine appetites.</p><p>If thou give fully to thy soul the delight of her desire, she will make thee the laughingstock of thine enemies.</p><p>Make not merry in much luxury; Neither be tied to the expense thereof.</p><p>Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing, when thou hast nothing in thy purse. A workman that is a drunkard shall not become rich.</p><p>He that despiseth small things Shall fall by little and little.</p><p>Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will be the more reckless. Moths and worms shall have him to heritage; and a reckless soul shall be taken away.</p><p> </p> </section> <footer> <p>&copy; 2023 ebiblecommentary.
