          'And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that
          disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into
          the palace of the high priest. But Peter stood at the door without.
          Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high
          priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
          Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also
          one of this Man's disciples? He saith, I am not. And the servants and
          officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold:
          and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed
          himself. The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His
          doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever
          taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always
          resort; and in secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou Me? ask
          them which heard Me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know
          what I said. And when He had thus spoken, one of the officers which
          stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest
          Thou the high priest so? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil,
          bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou Me? Now Annas
          had sent Him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. And Simon Peter
          stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou
          also one of His disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. One of
          the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut
          off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with Him? Peter then
          denied again: and immediately the cock crew.' -- JOHN xviii.15-27.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last verses of the preceding passage belong properly to this one,
          for they tell us that Jesus was 'first' brought before Annas, a fact
          which we owe to John only. Annas himself and his five sons held the
          high-priesthood in succession. To the sons has to be added Caiaphas,
          who, as we learn from John only, was Annas' son-in-law, and so one of
          the family party. That Jesus should have been taken to him, though he
          held no office at the time, shows who pulled the strings in the
          Sanhedrim. The reference to Caiaphas in verse 14 seems intended to
          suggest what sort of a trial might be expected, presided over by such
          a man. But verse 15 tells us that Jesus entered in, accompanied by
          'another disciple,' 'to the court,' not, as we should have expected,
          of Annas, but 'of the high priest,' who, by the testimony of verse 13,
          can be no one but Caiaphas. How came that about? Apparently, because
          Annas had apartments in the high-priest's official residence. As he
          obviously exercised the influence through his sons and son-in- law,
          who successively held the office, it was very natural that he should
          be a fixture in the palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          What John's connection was with this veteran intriguer (assuming that
          John was that 'other disciple') we do not know. Probably it was some
          family bond that united two such antipathetic natures. At all events,
          the Apostle's acquaintance with the judge so far condoned his
          discipleship to the criminal, that the doors of the audience chamber
          were open to him, though he was known as 'one of them.'
        </p>
        <p>
          So he and poor Peter were parted, and the latter left shivering
          outside in the grey of the morning. John had not missed him at first,
          for he would be too much absorbed in watching Jesus to have thoughts
          to spare for Peter, and would conclude that he was following him; but,
          when he did miss him, like a brave man he ran the risk of being
          observed, and went for him. The sharp-witted porteress, whose business
          it was to judge applicants for entrance by a quick glance, at once
          inferred that Peter 'also' was one of this man's disciples. Her 'also'
          shows that she knew John to be one; and her 'this man' shows that
          either she did not know Jesus' name, or thought Him too far beneath
          her to be named by her! The time during which Peter had been left
          outside alone, repenting now of, and alarmed for what might happen to
          him on account of, his ill-aimed blow at Malchus, and feeling the
          nipping cold, had taken all his courage out of him. The one thing he
          wished was to slip in unnoticed, and so the first denial came to his
          lips as rashly as many another word had come in old days. He does not
          seem to have remained with John, who probably went up to the upper end
          of the hall, where the examination was going on, while Peter, not
          having the <i>entree</i> and very much terrified as well as miserable,
          stayed at the lower end, where the understrappers were making
          themselves comfortable round a charcoal fire, and paying no attention
          to the proceedings at the other end. He seemed to be as indifferent as
          they were, and to be intent only on getting himself warmed. But what
          surges of emotion would be tossing in his heart, which yet he was
          trying to hide under the mask of being an unconcerned spectator, like
          the others!
        </p>
        <p>
          The examination of our Lord was conducted by 'the high priest,' by
          which title John must mean Caiaphas, as he has just emphatically noted
          that he then filled the office. But how is that to be reconciled with
          the statement that Jesus was taken to Annas? Apparently by supposing
          that, though Annas was present, Caiaphas was spokesman. But did not a
          formal trial before Caiaphas follow, and does not John tell us (verse
          24) that, after the first examination, Annas sent Jesus bound to
          Caiaphas? Yes. And are these things compatible with this account of an
          examination conducted by the latter? Yes, if we remember that flagrant
          wresting of justice marked the whole proceedings. The condemnation of
          Jesus was a judicial murder, in which the highest court of the Jews
          'decreed iniquity by a law'; and it was of a piece with all the rest
          that he, who was to pose as an impartial judge presently, should, in
          the spirit of a partisan, conduct this preliminary inquiry. Observe
          that no sentence was pronounced in the case at this stage. This was
          not a court at all. What was it? An attempt to entrap the prisoner
          into admissions which might be used against Him in the court to be
          held presently. The rulers had Jesus in their hands, and they did not
          know what to do with Him now that they had Him. They were at a loss to
          know what His indictment was to be. To kill Him was the only thing on
          which they had made up their minds; the pretext had yet to be found,
          and so they tried to get Him to say something which would serve their
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The high priest therefore asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His
          teaching'! If they did not know about either, why had they arrested
          Him? Cunning outwits itself, and falls into the pit it digs for the
          innocent. Jesus passed by the question as to His disciples unnoticed,
          and by His calm answer as to His teaching showed that He saw the
          snare. He reduced Caiaphas and Annas to perpetrating plain injustice,
          or to letting Him go free. Elementary fair play to a prisoner
          prescribes that he should be accused of some crime by some one, and
          not that he should furnish his judges with materials for his own
          indictment. 'Why askest thou Me? ask them that have heard Me,' is
          unanswerable, except by such an answer as the officious 'servant' gave
          -- a blow and a violent speech. But Christ's words reach far beyond
          the momentary purpose; they contain a wide truth. His teaching loves
          the daylight. There are no muttered oracles, no whispered secrets for
          the initiated, no double voice, one for the multitude, and another for
          the adepts. All is above-board, and all is spoken 'openly to the
          world.' Christianity has no cliques or coteries, nothing sectional,
          nothing reserved. It is for mankind, for all mankind, all for mankind.
          True, there are depths in it; true, the secrets which Jesus can only
          speak to loving ears in secret are His sweetest words, but they are
          'spoken in the ear' that they may be 'proclaimed on the housetops.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-priest is silent, for there was nothing that he could say to
          so undeniable a demand, and he had no witnesses ready. How many since
          his day have treated Jesus as he treated Him -- condemned Him or
          rejected Him without reason, and then looked about for reasons to
          justify their attitude, or even sought to make Him condemn Himself!
        </p>
        <p>
          An unjust judge breeds insolent underlings, and if everything else
          fails, blows and foul words cover defeat, and treat calm assertion of
          right as impertinence to high-placed officials. Caiaphas degraded his
          own dignity more than any words of a prisoner could degrade it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's answer 'reviled not again.' It is meek in majesty and
          majestic in meekness. Patient endurance is not forbidden to
          remonstrate with insolent injustice, if only its remonstrance bears no
          heat of personal anger in it. But Jesus was not so much vindicating
          His words to Caiaphas in saying, 'If I have spoken evil, bear witness
          of the evil,' as reiterating the challenge for 'witnesses.' He brands
          the injustice of Caiaphas, while meekly rebuking the brutality of his
          servant. Master and man were alike in smiting Him for words of which
          they could not prove the evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was obviously nothing to be gained by further examination. No
          crime had been alleged, much less established; therefore Jesus ought
          to have been let go. But Annas treated Him as a criminal, and handed
          Him over 'bound,' to be formally tried before the man who had just
          been foiled in his attempt to play the inquisitor. What a hideous
          mockery of legal procedure! How well the pair, father-in-law and son-
          in-law, understood each other! What a confession of a foregone
          conclusion, evidence or no evidence, in shackling Jesus as a
          malefactor! And it was all done in the name of religion! and perhaps
          the couple of priests did not know that they were hypocrites, but
          really thought that they were 'doing God service.'
        </p>
        <p>
          John's account of Peter's denials rises to a climax of peril and of
          keenness of suspicion. The unnamed persons who put the second question
          must have had their suspicions roused by something in his manner as he
          stood by the glinting fire, perhaps by agitation too great to be
          concealed. The third question was put by a more dangerous person
          still, who not only recognised Peter's features as the firelight
          fitfully showed them, but had a personal ground of hostility in his
          relationship to Malchus.
        </p>
        <p>
          John lovingly spares telling of the oaths and curses accompanying the
          denials, but dares not spare the narration of the fact. It has too
          precious lessons of humility, of self-distrust, of the possibility of
          genuine love being overborne by sudden and strong temptation, to be
          omitted. And the sequel of the denials has yet more precious teaching,
          which has brought balm to many a contrite heart, conscious of having
          been untrue to its deepest love. For the sound of the cock- crow, and
          the look from the Lord as He was led away bound past the place where
          Peter stood, brought him back to himself, and brought tears to his
          eyes, which were sweet as well as bitter. On the resurrection morning
          the risen Lord sent the message of forgiveness and special love to the
          broken-hearted Apostle, when He said, 'Go, tell My disciples and
          Peter,' and on that day there was an interview of which Paul knew (1
          Cor. xv.5), but the details of which were apparently communicated by
          the Apostle to none of his brethren. The denier who weeps is taken to
          Christ's heart, and in sacred secrecy has His forgiveness freely
          given, though, before he can be restored to his public office, he
          must, by his threefold public avowal of love, efface his threefold
          denial. We may say, 'Thou knowest that I love thee,' even if we have
          said, 'I know Him not,' and come nearer to Jesus, by reason of the
          experience of His pardoning love, than we were before we fell.
