          'And in that day ye shall ask Me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto
          you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it
          you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall
          receive, that your joy may be full.' -- JOHN xvi.23, 24.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord here sums up the prerogatives and privileges of His servants
          in the day that was about to dawn and to last till He came again.
          There is nothing absolutely new in the words; substantially the
          promises contained in them have appeared in former parts of these
          discourses under somewhat different aspects and connections. But our
          Lord brings them together here, in this condensed repetition, in order
          that the scattered rays, being thus focussed, may have more power to
          illuminate with certitude, and to warm into hope. 'Ye shall ask Me
          nothing.... Ask and ye shall receive.... Your joy shall be full.'
          These are the jewels which He sets in a cluster, the juxtaposition
          making each brighter, and gives to us for a parting keepsake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is to be noticed that the two askings which are spoken of here
          are expressed by different words in the Greek. Our English word 'ask'
          means two things, either to question or to request; to ask in the
          sense of interrogating, in order to get information and teaching, or
          in the sense of beseeching, in order to get gifts. In the former sense
          the word is employed in the first clause of my text, with distinct
          reference to the disciples' desire, a moment or two before, to ask Him
          a very foolish question; and in the second sense it is employed in the
          central portion of my text.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, there are three things here as the marks of the Christian
          life all through the ages: the cessation of the ignorant questions
          addressed to a present Christ; the satisfaction of desires; and the
          perfecting of joy. These are the characteristics of a true Christian
          life. My brother, are they in any degree the characteristics of yours?
        </p>
        <p>I. Note then, first, the end of questionings.</p>
        <p>
          'In that day ye shall ask Me nothing,' and do not you think that when
          the disciples heard that, they would be tempted to say, 'Then what in
          all the world are we to do?' To them the thought that He was not to be
          at their sides any longer, for them to go to with their difficulties,
          must have seemed despair rather than advance; but in Christ's eyes it
          was progress. He tells them and us that we gain by losing Him, and are
          better off than they were, precisely because He does not any longer
          stand at our sides for us to question. It is better for a boy to
          puzzle out the meaning of a Latin book by his own brains and the help
          of a dictionary than it is lazily to use an interlinear translation.
          And, though we do not always feel it, and are often tempted to think
          how blessed it would be if we had an infallible Teacher visible here
          at our sides, it is a great deal better for us that we have not, and
          it is a step in advance that He has gone away. Many eager and honest
          Christian souls, hungering after certainty and rest, have cast
          themselves in these latter days into the arms of an infallible Church.
          I doubt whether any such questioning mind has found what it sought;
          and I am sure that it has taken a step downwards, in passing from the
          spiritual guidance realised by our own honest industry and earnest use
          of the materials supplied to us in Christ's word, to any external
          authority which comes to us to save us the trouble of thinking, and to
          confirm to us truth which we have not made our own by search and
          effort. We gain by losing the visible Christ; and He was proclaiming
          progress and not retrogression, when He said: 'In that day ye shall
          ask Me no more questions.'
        </p>
        <p>
          For what have we instead? We have two things: a completed revelation,
          and an inward Teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a completed revelation. Great and wonderful and unspeakably
          precious as were and are the words of Jesus Christ, His deeds are far
          more. The death of Christ has told us things that Christ before His
          death could not tell. The resurrection of Christ has cast light upon
          all the darkest places of man's destiny which Christ, before His
          resurrection, could not by any words so illuminate. The ascension of
          Christ has opened doors for thought, for faith, for hope, which were
          fast closed, notwithstanding all His teachings, until He had burst
          them asunder and passed to His throne. And the facts which are
          substituted for the bodily presence of Jesus with His disciples tell
          us a great deal more than they could ever have drawn from Him by
          questionings, however persistent and however wisely directed. We have
          a completed revelation, and therefore we need 'ask Him nothing.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And we have a divine Spirit that will come to us if we will, and teach
          us by means of blessing the exercise of our own faculties, and guiding
          us, not, indeed, into the uniform perception of the intellectual
          aspects of Christian truth, but into the apprehension and the loving
          possession, as a power in our lives, of all the truth that we need to
          mould our characters and to raise us to the likeness of Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only, brother! let us remember what such a method of teaching demands
          from us. It needs that we honestly use the revelation that is given
          us; it needs that we loyally, lovingly, trustfully, submit ourselves
          to the teaching of that Spirit who will dwell in us; it needs that we
          bring our lives up to the height of our present knowledge, and make
          everything that we know a factor in shaping what we do and what we
          are. If thus we will to do His will, 'we shall know of the doctrine';
          if thus we yield ourselves to the divine Spirit, we shall be taught
          the practical bearings of all essential truth; and if thus we ponder
          the facts and principles that are enshrined in Christ's life, and the
          Apostolic commentary on them, as preserved for us in the Scripture, we
          shall not need to envy those that could go to Him with their
          questions, for <i>He</i> will come to us with His all-satisfying
          answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! but you say experience does not verify these promises. Look at a
          divided Christendom; look at my own difficulties of knowing what I am
          to believe and to think. Well, as for a divided Christendom, saintly
          souls are all of one Church, and however they may formulate the
          intellectual aspects of their creed, when they come to pray, they say
          the same things. Roman Catholic and Protestant, and Quaker and
          Churchman, and Calvinist and Arminian, and Greek and Latin Christians
          -- all contribute to the hymn-book of every sect; and we all sing
          their songs. So the divisions are like the surface cracks on a dry
          field, and a few inches down there is continuity. As for the
          difficulty of knowing what I am to believe and think about
          controverted questions, no doubt there will remain many gaps in the
          circle of our knowledge; no doubt there will be much left obscure and
          unanswered; but if we will keep ourselves near the Master, and use
          honestly and diligently the helps that He gives us -- the outward help
          in the Word, and the inward help in His teaching Spirit -- we shall
          not 'walk in darkness,' but shall have light enough given to be to us
          'the Light of Life.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Brother, keep close to Christ, and Christ -- present though absent --
          will teach you.
        </p>
        <p>II. Secondly, satisfied desires.</p>
        <p>
          This second great promise of my text, introduced again by the solemn
          affirmation, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you,' substantially appeared
          in a former part of these discourses with a very significant
          difference. 'Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name that will I do.' 'If
          ye shall ask anything in My name I will do it.' There Christ presented
          Himself as the Answerer of the petitions, because His more immediate
          purpose was to set forth His going to the Father as His elevation to a
          yet loftier position. Here, on the other hand, He sets forth the
          Father as the Answerer of the petitions, because His purpose is to
          point away from undue dependence on His own corporeal presence. But
          the fact that He thus, as occasion requires, substitutes the one form
          of speech for the other, and indifferently represents the same actions
          as being done by Himself and by the Father in heaven, carries with it
          large teachings which I do not dwell upon now. Only I would ask you to
          consider how much is involved in that fact, that, as a matter of
          course, and without explanation of the difference, our Lord alternates
          the two forms, and sometimes says, 'I will do it,' and sometimes says,
          'The Father will do it.' Does it not point to that great and blessed
          truth, 'Whatsoever thing the Father doeth, that also doeth the Son
          likewise?'
        </p>
        <p>
          But passing from that, let me ask you to note very carefully the
          limitation, which is here given to the broad universality of the
          declaration that desires shall be satisfied. 'If ye shall ask anything
          in My name'; there is the definition of Christian prayer. And what
          does it mean? Is a prayer, which from the beginning to the end is
          reeking with self-will, hallowed because we say, as a kind of charm at
          the end of it, 'For Christ's sake. Amen'? Is <i>that</i> praying in
          Christ's name? Surely not! What is the 'name' of Christ? His whole
          revealed character. So these disciples could not pray in His name
          'hitherto,' because His character was not all revealed. Therefore, to
          pray in His name is to pray, recognising what He is, as revealed in
          His life and death and resurrection and ascension, and to base all our
          dependence of acceptance of our prayers upon that revealed character.
          Is that all? Are any kind of wishes, which are presented in dependence
          upon Christ as our only Hope and Channel of divine blessing, certain
          to be fulfilled? Certainly not. To pray 'in My name' means yet more
          than that. It means not only to pray in dependence upon Christ as our
          only Ground of hope and Source of acceptance and God's only Channel of
          blessing, but it means exactly what the same phrase means when it is
          applied to us. If I say that I am doing something in your name, that
          means on your behalf, as your representative, as your organ, and to
          express your mind and will. And if we pray in Christ's name, that
          implies, not only our dependence upon His merit and work, but also the
          harmony of our wills with His will, and that our requests are not
          merely the hot products of our own selfishness, but are the calm
          issues of communion with Him. <i>Thus</i> to pray requires the
          suppression of self. Heathen prayer, if there be such a thing, is the
          violent effort to make God will what I wish. Christian prayer is the
          submissive effort to make my wish what God wills, and that is to pray
          in Christ's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brother! do we construct our prayers thus? Do we try to bring our
          desires into harmony with Him, before we venture to express them? Do
          we go to His footstool to pour out petulant, blind, passionate, un-
          sanctified wishes after questionable and contingent good, or do we
          wait until He fills our spirits with longings after what it must be
          His desire to give, and then breathe out those desires caught from His
          own heart, and echoing His own will? Ah! The discipline that is wanted
          to make men pray in Christ's name is little understood by multitudes
          amongst us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how certain such prayer is of being answered. Of course, if it
          is in harmony with the will of God, it is sure not to be offered in
          vain. Our Revised Version makes a slight alteration in the order of
          the words in the first clause of this promise by reading, 'If ye ask
          anything of the Father He will give it you <i>in My name</i>.' God's
          gifts come down through the same channel through which our prayer goes
          up. We ask in the name of Christ, and get our answers in the name of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, whether that be the true collocation of ideas or not, mark the
          plain principle here, that only desires which are in harmony with the
          divine will are sure of being satisfied. What is a bad thing for a
          child cannot be a good thing for a man. What is a foolish and wicked
          thing for a father down here to do cannot be a kind and a wise thing
          for the Father in the heavens to do. If you wish to spoil your child
          you say, 'What do you want, my dear? tell me and you shall have it.'
          And if God were saying anything like that to us, through the lips of
          Jesus Christ His Son, in the text, it would be no blessing, but a
          curse. He knows a great deal better what is good for us; and so He
          says: 'Bring your wishes into line with My purpose, and then you will
          get them'; 'Delight thyself in the Lord, and He will give thee the
          desires of thine heart.' If you want God most you will be sure to get
          Him; if your heart's desires are after Him, your heart's desires will
          be satisfied. 'The young lions do roar and suffer hunger.' That is the
          world's way of getting good; fighting and striving and snarling, and
          forcibly seeking to grasp, and there is hunger after all. There is a
          better way than that. Instead of striving and struggling to snatch and
          to keep a perishable and questionable portion, let us wait upon God
          and quiet our hearts, stilling them into the temper of communion and
          conformity with Him, and we shall not ask in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who prays in Christ's name must pray Christ's prayer, 'Not My will,
          but Thine be done.' And then, though many wishes may be unanswered,
          and many weak petitions unfulfilled, and many desires unsatisfied, the
          essential spirit of the prayer will be answered, and, His will being
          done in us and on us, our wishes will acquiesce in it and desire
          nothing besides. To him who can thus pray in Christ's name in the
          deepest sense, and after Christ's pattern, every door in God's
          treasure-house flies open, and he may take as much of the treasure as
          he desires. The Master bends lovingly over such a soul, and looks him
          in the eyes, and with outstretched hand says, 'What wilt thou that I
          should do unto thee? Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.'
        </p>
        <p>III. Lastly, the perfect joy which follows upon these two.</p>
        <p>
          'That your joy may be fulfilled.' Again we have a recurrence of a
          promise that has appeared in another connection in an earlier part of
          this discourse; but the connection here is worthy of notice. The
          promise is of joy that comes from the satisfaction of meek desires in
          unison with Christ's will. Is it possible then, that, amidst all the
          ups and downs, the changes and the sorrows of this fluctuating,
          tempest-tossed life of ours we may have a deep and stable joy? 'That
          your joy may be full,' says my text, or 'fulfilled,' like some
          jewelled, golden cup charged to the very brim with rich and quickening
          wine, so that there is no room for a drop more. Can it be that ever,
          in this world, men shall be happy up to the very limits of their
          capacity? Was anybody ever so blessed that he could not be more so?
          Was your cup ever so full that there was no room for another drop in
          it? Jesus Christ says that it may be so, and He tells us how it may be
          so. Bring your desires into harmony with God's, and you will have none
          unsatisfied amongst them; and so you will be blessed to the full; and
          though sorrow comes, as of course it will come, still you may be
          blessed. There is no contradiction between the presence of this deep,
          central joy and a surface and circumference of sorrow. Rather we need
          the surrounding sorrow, to concentrate, and so to intensify, the
          central joy in God. There are some flowers which only blow in the
          night; and white blossoms are visible with startling plainness in the
          twilight, when all the flaunting purples and reds are hid. We do not
          know the depth, the preciousness, the power of the 'joy of the Lord,'
          until we have felt it shining in our hearts in the midst of the thick
          darkness of earthly sorrow, and bringing life into the very death of
          our human delights. It may be ours on the conditions that my text
          describes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends! there are only two courses before us. Either we must
          have a life with superficial, transitory, incomplete gladness, and an
          aching centre of vacuity and pain, or we may have a life which, in its
          outward aspects and superficial appearance, has much about it that is
          sad and trying, but down in the heart of it is calm and joyful. Which
          of the two do you deem best, a superficial gladness and a rooted
          sorrow, or a superficial sorrow and a central joy? 'Even in laughter
          the heart is sorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness.' But,
          on the other hand, the 'ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to
          Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. They shall
          obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.'
