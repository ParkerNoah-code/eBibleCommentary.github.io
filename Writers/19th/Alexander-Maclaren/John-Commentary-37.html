          'Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto yon: as My Father hath
          sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed on
          them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever
          sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye
          retain, they are retained.' -- JOHN xx.21-23.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of the Resurrection had been full of strange rumours, and of
          growing excitement. As evening fell, some of the disciples, at any
          rate, gathered together, probably in the upper room. They were brave,
          for in spite of the Jews they dared to assemble; they were timid, for
          they barred themselves in 'for fear of the Jews.' No doubt in little
          groups they were eagerly discussing what had happened that day. Fuel
          was added to the fire by the return of the two from Emmaus. And then,
          at once, the buzz of conversation ceased, for 'He Himself, with His
          human air,' stood there in the midst, with the quiet greeting on His
          lips, which might have come from any casual stranger, and minimised
          the separation that was now ending: 'Peace be unto you!'
        </p>
        <p>
          We have two accounts of that evening's interview which remarkably
          supplement each other. They deal with two different parts of it. John
          begins where Luke ends. The latter Evangelist dwells mainly on the
          disciples' fears that it was some ghostly appearance that they saw,
          and on the removal of these by the sight, and perhaps the touch, of
          the hands and the feet. John says nothing of the terror, but Luke's
          account explains John's statement that 'He showed them His hands and
          His side,' and that, 'Then were the disciples glad,' the joy expelling
          the fear. Luke's account also, by dwelling on the first part of the
          interview, explains what else is unexplained in John's narrative, viz.
          the repetition of the salutation, 'Peace be unto you!' Our Lord
          thereby marked off the previous portion of the conversation as being
          separate, and a whole in itself. Their doubts were dissipated, and now
          something else was to begin. They who were sure of the risen Lord, and
          had had communion with Him, were capable of receiving a deeper peace,
          and so 'Jesus said to them again, Peace be unto you!' and thereby
          inaugurated the second part of the interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke's account also helps us in another and very important way. John
          simply says that 'the disciples were gathered together,' and that
          might mean the Eleven only. Luke is more specific, and tells us what
          is of prime importance for understanding the whole incident, that 'the
          Eleven... and they that were with them' were assembled. This
          interview, the crown of the appearances on Easter Day, is marked as
          being an interview with the assembled body of disciples, whom the
          Lord, having scattered their doubts, and laid the deep benediction of
          His peace upon their hearts, then goes on to invest with a sacred
          mission, 'As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you'; to equip
          them with the needed power, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost'; and to unfold
          to them the solemn issues of their work, 'Whose sins ye remit they are
          remitted; and whose sins ye retain they are retained.' The message of
          that Easter evening is for us all; and so I ask you to look at these
          three points.
        </p>
        <p>I. The Christian Mission.</p>
        <p>
          I have already said that the clear understanding of the persons to
          whom the words were spoken, goes far to interpret the significance of
          the words. Here we have at the very beginning, the great thought that
          every Christian man and woman is sent by Jesus. The possession of what
          preceded this charge is the thing, and the only thing, that fits a man
          to receive it, and whoever possesses these is thereby despatched into
          the world as being Christ's envoy and representative. And what are
          these preceding experiences? The vision of the risen Christ, the touch
          of His hands, the peace that He breathed over believing souls, the
          gladness that sprang like a sunny fountain in the hearts that had been
          so dry and dark. Those things constituted the disciples' qualification
          for being sent, and these things were themselves -- even apart from
          the Master's words -- their sending out on their future life's-work.
          Thus, whoever -- and thank God I am addressing many who come under the
          category! -- whoever has seen the Lord, has been in touch with Him,
          and has felt his heart filled with gladness, is the recipient of this
          great commission. There is no question here of the prerogative of a
          class, nor of the functions of an order; it is a question of the
          universal aspect of the Christian life in its relation to the Master
          who sends, and the world into which it is sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We Nonconformists pride ourselves upon our freedom from what we call
          'sacerdotalism.' Ay! and we Nonconformists are quite willing to assert
          our priesthood in opposition to the claims of a class, and are as
          willing to forget it, should the question of the duties of the priest
          come into view. You do not believe in priests, but a great many of you
          believe that it is ministers that are 'sent,' and that you have no
          charge. Officialism is the dry-rot of all the Churches, and is found
          as rampant amongst democratic Nonconformists as amongst the more
          hierarchical communities. Brethren! you are included in Christ's words
          of sending on this errand, if you are included in this greeting of
          'Peace be unto you!' 'I send,' not the clerical order, not the priest,
          but 'you,' because you have seen the Lord, and been glad, and heard
          the low whisper of His benediction creeping into your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, too, how our Lord reveals much of Himself, as well as of our
          position, when He thus speaks. For He assumes here the royal tone, and
          claims to possess as absolute authority over the lives and work of all
          Christian people as the Father exercised when He sent the Son. But we
          must further ask ourselves the question, what is the parallel that our
          Lord here draws, not only between His action in sending us, and the
          Father's action in sending Him, but also between the attitude of the
          Son who was sent, and of the disciples whom He sends? And the answer
          is this -- the work of Jesus Christ is continued by, prolonged in, and
          carried on henceforward through, the work that He lays upon His
          servants. Mark the exact expression that our Lord here uses. 'As My
          Father <i>hath</i> sent,' that is a past action, continuing its
          consequences in the present. It is not 'as My Father <i>did</i> send
          once,' but as 'My Father <i>hath</i> sent,' which means 'is also at
          present sending,' and continues to send. Which being translated into
          less technical phraseology is just this, that we here have our Lord
          presenting to us the thought that, though in a new form, His work
          continues during the ages, and is now being wrought through His
          servants. What He does by another, He does by Himself. We Christian
          men and women do not understand our function in the world, unless we
          have realised this: 'Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ' and His
          interests and His work are entrusted to our hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall the servants continue and carry on the work of the Master?
          The chief way to do it is by proclaiming everywhere that finished work
          on which the world's hopes depend. But note, -- '<i>as</i> My Father
          hath sent Me, so send I you,' -- then we are not only to carry on His
          work in the world, but if one might venture to say so, we are to
          reproduce His attitude towards God and the world. He was sent to be
          'the Light of the world'; and so are we. He was sent to 'seek and to
          save that which was lost'; so are we. He was sent not to do His own
          will, but the will of the Father that sent Him; so are we. He took
          upon Himself with all cheerfulness the office to which He was
          appointed, and said, 'My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me,
          -- and to finish His work'; and that must be our voice too. He was
          sent to pity, to look upon the multitudes with compassion, to carry to
          them the healing of His touch, and the sympathy of His heart; so must
          we. We are the representatives of Jesus Christ, and if I might dare to
          use such a phrase, He is to be incarnated again in the hearts, and
          manifested again in the lives, of His servants. Many weak eyes, that
          would be dazzled and hurt if they were to gaze on the sun, may look at
          the clouds cradled by its side, and dyed with its lustre, and learn
          something of the radiance and the glory of the illuminating light from
          the illuminated vapour. And thus, 'as My Father hath sent Me, even so
          send I you.'
        </p>
        <p>Now let us turn to</p>
        <p>II. The Christian Equipment.</p>
        <p>
          'He breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost!' The
          symbolical action reminds us of the Creation story, when into the
          nostrils was breathed 'the breath of life, and man became a living
          soul.' The symbol is but a symbol, but what it teaches us is that
          every Christian man who has passed through the experiences which make
          him Christ's envoy, receives the equipment of a new life, and that
          that life is the gift of the risen Lord. This Prometheus came from the
          dead with the spark of life guarded in His pierced hands, and He
          bestowed it upon us; for the Spirit of life, which is the Spirit of
          Christ, is granted to all Christian men. Dear brethren! we have not
          lived up to the realities of our Christian confession, unless into our
          death has come, and there abides, this life derived from Jesus
          Himself, the communication of which goes along with all faith in Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the gift which Jesus brought to that group of timid disciples in
          the upper room did not make superfluous the further gift on the day of
          Pentecost. The communication of the divine Spirit to men runs parallel
          with, depends on, and follows, the revelation of divine truth, so the
          ascended Lord gave more of that life to the disciples, who had been
          made capable of more of it by the fact of beholding His ascension,
          than the risen Lord could give on that Easter Day. But whilst thus
          there are measures and degrees, the life is given to every believer in
          correspondence with the clearness and the contents of his faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the power that will fit any of us for the work for which we are
          sent into the world. If we are here to represent Jesus Christ, and if
          it is true of us that 'as He is, so are we, in this world,' that
          likeness can only come about by our receiving into our spirits a
          kindred life which will effloresce and manifest itself to men in
          kindred beauty of foliage and of fruit. If we are to be 'the lights of
          the world,' our lamps must be fed with oil. If we are to be Christ's
          representatives, we must have Christ's life in us. Here, too, is the
          only source of strength and life to us Christian people, when we look
          at the difficulties of our task and measure our own feebleness against
          the work that lies before us. I suppose no man has ever tried honestly
          to be what Christ wished him to be amidst his fellows, whether as
          preacher or teacher or guide in any fashion, who has not hundreds of
          times clasped his hands in all but despair, and said, 'Who is
          sufficient for these things?' That is the temper into which the power
          will come. The rivers run in the valleys, and it is the lowly sense of
          our own unfitness for the task which yet presses upon us, and
          imperatively demands to be done, that makes us capable of receiving
          that divine gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is for lack of it that so much of so-called 'Christian effort'
          comes to nothing. The priests may pile the wood upon the altar, and
          compass it all day long with vain cries, and nothing happens. It is
          not till the fire comes down from heaven that sacrifice and altar and
          wood and water in the trench, are licked up and converted into fiery
          light. So, dear brethren! it is because the Christian Church as a
          whole, and we as individual members of it, so imperfectly realise the
          A B C of our faith, our absolute dependence on the inbreathed life of
          Jesus Christ, to fit us for any of our work, that so much of our work
          is ploughing the sands, and so often we labour for vanity and spend
          our strength for nought. What is the use of a mill full of spindles
          and looms until the fire-born impulse comes rushing through the pipes?
          Then they begin to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you, too, that the words which our Lord here employs
          about these great gifts, when accurately examined, do lead us to the
          thought that we, even we, are not altogether passive in the reception
          of that gift. For the expression, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost' might,
          with more completeness of signification, be rendered, 'take ye the
          Holy Ghost.' True, the outstretched hand is nothing, unless the giving
          hand is stretched out too. True, the open palm and the clutching
          fingers remain empty, unless the open palm above drops the gift. But
          also true, things in the spiritual realm that are given have to be
          asked for, because asking opens the heart for their entrance. True,
          that gift was given once for all, and continuously, but the
          appropriation and the continual possession of it largely depend upon
          ourselves. There must be desire before there can be possession. If a
          man does not take his pitcher to the fountain the pitcher remains
          empty, though the fountain never ceases to spring. There must be
          taking by patient waiting. The old Friends had a lovely phrase when
          they spoke about 'waiting for the springing of the life.' If we hold
          out a tremulous hand, and our cup is not kept steady, the falling
          water will not enter it, and much will be spilt upon the ground. Wait
          on the Lord, and the life will rise like a tide in the heart. There
          must be a taking by the faithful use of what we possess. 'To him that
          hath shall be given.' There must be a taking by careful avoidance of
          what would hinder. In the winter weather the water supply sometimes
          fails in a house. Why? Because there is a plug of ice in the
          service-pipe. Some of us have a plug of ice, and so the water has not
          come,
        </p>
        <p>'<i>Take</i> the Holy Spirit!'</p>
        <p>Now, lastly, we have here</p>
        <p>III. The Christian power over sin.</p>
        <p>
          I am not going to enter upon controversy. The words which close our
          Lord's great charge here have been much misunderstood by being
          restricted. It is eminently necessary to remember here that they were
          spoken to the whole community of Christian souls. The harm that has
          been done by their restriction to the so-called priestly function of
          absolution has been, not only the monstrous claims which have been
          thereon founded, but quite as much the obscuration of the large
          effects that follow from the Christian discharge by all believers of
          the office of representing Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must interpret these words in harmony with the two preceding
          points, the Christian mission and the Christian equipment. So
          interpreted, they lead us to a very plain thought which I may put
          thus. This same Apostle tells us in his letter that 'Jesus Christ was
          manifested to take away sin.' His work in this world, which we are to
          continue, was 'to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.' We
          continue that work when, -- as we have all, if Christians, the right
          to do -- we lift up our voices with triumphant confidence, and call
          upon our brethren to 'behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin
          of the world!' The proclamation has a twofold effect, according as it
          is received or rejected; to him who receives it his sins melt away,
          and the preacher of forgiveness through Christ has the right to say to
          his brother, 'Thy sins are forgiven because thou believest on Him.'
          The rejecter or the neglecter binds his sin upon himself by his
          rejection or neglect. The same message is, as the Apostle puts it, 'a
          savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.' These words are the
          best commentary on this part of my text. The same heat, as the old
          Fathers used to say, 'softens wax and hardens clay.' The message of
          the word will either couch a blind eye, and let in the light, or draw
          another film of obscuration over the visual orb.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, Christian men and women have to feel that to them is entrusted
          a solemn message, that they walk in the world charged with a mighty
          power, that by the preaching of the Word, and by their own utterance
          of the forgiving mercy of the Lord Jesus, they may 'remit' or 'retain'
          not only the punishment of sin, but sin itself. How tender, how
          diligent, how reverent, how -- not bowed down, but -- erect under the
          weight of our obligations, we should be, if we realised that solemn
          thought!
