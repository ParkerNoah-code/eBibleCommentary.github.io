          'If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.
          If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye
          are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
          therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto
          you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted
          Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My saying, they
          will keep yours also.' -- JOHN xv.18-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          These words strike a discord in the midst of the sweet music to which
          we have been listening. The key-note of all that has preceded has been
          love -- the love of Christ's friends to one another, and of all to
          Him, as an answer to His love to all. That love, which is one, whether
          it rise to Him or is diffused on the level of earth, is the result of
          that unity of life between the Vine and the branches, of which our
          Lord has been speaking such great and wonderful things. But that unity
          of life between Christians and Christ has another consequence than the
          spread of love. Just because it binds them to Him in a sacred
          community, it separates them from those who do not share in His life,
          and hence the 'hate' of our context is the shadow of 'love'; and there
          result two communities -- to use the much-abused words that designate
          them -- the Church and 'the World'; and the antagonism between these
          is deep, fundamental, and perpetual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unquestionably, our Lord is here speaking with special reference to
          the Apostles, who, in a very tragic sense, were 'sent forth as sheep
          in the midst of wolves.' If we may trust tradition, every one of that
          little company, Speaker as well as hearers, died a martyr's death,
          with the exception of John himself, who was preserved from it by a
          miracle. But, be that as it may, our Lord is here laying down a
          universal statement of the permanent condition of things; and there is
          no more reason for restricting the force of these words to the
          original hearers of them than there is for restricting the force of
          any of the rest of this wonderful discourse. 'The world' will be in
          antagonism to the Church until the world ceases to be a world, because
          it obeys the King; and then, and not till then, will it cease to be
          hostile to His subjects.
        </p>
        <p>I. What makes this hostility inevitable?</p>
        <p>
          Our Lord here prepares His hearers for what is coming by putting it in
          the gentle form of an hypothesis. The frequency with which 'If' occurs
          in this section is very remarkable. He will not startle them by the
          bare, naked statement which they, in that hour of depression and
          agitation, were so little able to endure, but He puts it in the shape
          of a 'suppose that,' not because there is any doubt, but in order to
          alleviate the pain of the impression which He desires to make. He
          says, 'If the world hates,' not 'if the world hate'; and the tense of
          the original shows that, whilst the form of the statement is
          hypothetical, the substance of it is prophetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus points to two things, as you will observe, which make this
          hostility inevitable. 'If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me
          before it hated you.' And again, 'If ye were of the world, the world
          would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have
          chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.' The very
          language carries with it the implication of necessary and continual
          antagonism. For what is 'the world,' in this context, but the
          aggregate of men, who have no share in the love and life that flow
          from Jesus Christ? Necessarily they constitute a unity, whatever
          diversities there may be amongst them, and necessarily, that unity in
          its banded phalanx is in antagonism, in some measure, to those who
          constitute the other unity, which holds by Christ, and has been drawn
          by Him from 'out of the world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          If we share Christ's life, we must, necessarily, in some measure,
          share His fate. It is the typical example of what the world thinks of,
          and does to, goodness. And all who have 'the Spirit of life which was
          in Jesus Christ' for the animating principle of their lives, will,
          just in the measure in which they possess it, come under the same
          influences which carried Him to the Cross. In a world like this, it is
          impossible for a man to 'love righteousness and hate iniquity,' and to
          order his life accordingly, without treading on somebody's corns;
          being a rebuke to the opposite course of conduct, either interfering
          with men's self-complacency or with their interests. From the
          beginning the blind world has repaid goodness by antagonism and
          contempt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then our Lord touches another, and yet closely-connected, cause
          when He speaks of His selecting the Apostles, and drawing them out of
          the world, as a reason for the world's hostility. There are two
          groups, and the fundamental principles that underlie each are in
          deadly antagonism. In the measure in which you and I are Christians we
          are in direct opposition to all the maxims which rule the world and
          make it a world. What we believe to be precious it regards as of no
          account. What we believe to be fundamental truth it passes by as of
          little importance. Much which we feel to be wrong it regards as good.
          Our jewels are its tinsel, and its jewels are our tinsel. We and it
          stand in diametrical opposition of thought about God, about self,
          about duty, about life, about death, about the future; and that
          opposition goes right down to the bottom of things. However it may be
          covered over, there is a gulf, as in some of those American canons:
          the towering cliffs may be very near -- only a yard or two seems to
          separate them; but they go down for thousands and thousands of feet,
          and never are any nearer each other, and between them at the bottom a
          black, sullen river flows. 'If ye were of the world, the world would
          love its own.' If it loves you, it is because ye are of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And so note, secondly, how this hostility is masked and modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a great many other bonds that unite men together besides the
          bonds of religious life or their absence. There are the domestic ties,
          there are the associations of commerce and neighbourhood, there are
          surface identities of opinion about many important things. The greater
          portion of our lives moves on this surface, whore all men are alike.
          'If you tickle us, do we not laugh; if you wound us, do we not bleed?'
          We have all the same affections and needs, pursue the same avocations,
          do the same sort of things, and a large portion of every one's life is
          under the dominion of habit and custom, and determined by external
          circumstances. So there is a film of roofing thrown over the gulf. You
          can make up a crack in a wall with plaster after a fashion, and it
          will hide the solution of continuity that lies beneath. But let bad
          weather come, and soon the bricks gape apart as before. And so, as
          soon as we get down below the surface of things and grapple with the
          real, deep-lying, and formative principles of a life, we come to
          antagonism, just as they used to come to it long ago, though the form
          of it has become quite different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there are other causes modifying this hostility. The world has
          got a dash of Christianity into it since Jesus Christ spoke. We cannot
          say that it is half Christianised, but some of the issues and remoter
          consequences of Christianity have permeated the general conscience,
          and the ethics of the Gospel are largely diffused in such a land as
          this. Thus Christian men and others have, to a large extent, a common
          code of morality, as long as they keep on the surface; and they not
          only do a good many things exactly alike, but do a great many things
          from substantially the same motives, and have the same way of looking
          at much. Thus the gulf is partly bridged over; and the hostility takes
          another form. We do not wrap Christians in pitch and stick them up for
          candles in the Emperor's garden nowadays, but the same thing can be
          done in different ways. Newspaper articles, the light laugh of scorn,
          the whoop of exultation over the failures or faults of any prominent
          man that has stood out boldly on Christ's side; all these indicate
          what lies below the surface, and sometimes not so very far below. Many
          a young man in a Manchester warehouse, trying to live a godly life,
          many a workman at his bench, many a commercial traveller in the inn or
          on the road, many a student on the college benches, has to find out
          that there is a great gulf between him and the man who sits next to
          him, and that he cannot be faithful to his Lord, and at the same time,
          down to the depths of his being, a friend of one who has no friendship
          to his Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still another fact masks the antagonism, and that is, that after all,
          the world, meaning thereby the aggregate of godless men, has a
          conscience that responds to goodness, though grumblingly and
          reluctantly. After all, men do know that it is better to be good, that
          it is better and wiser to be like Christ, that it is nobler to live
          for Him than for self, and that consciousness cannot but modify to
          some extent the manifestations of the hostility, but it is there all
          the same, and whosoever will be a Christian after Christ's pattern
          will find out that it is there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let a man for Christ's sake avow unpopular beliefs, let him try
          honestly to act out the New Testament, let him boldly seek to apply
          Christian principles to the fashionable and popular sins of his class
          or of his country, let him in any way be ahead of the conscience of
          the majority, and what a chorus will be yelping at his heels! Dear
          brethren, the law still remains, 'If any man will be a friend of the
          world he is at enmity with God.'
        </p>
        <p>III. Thirdly, note how you may escape the hostility.</p>
        <p>
          A half-Christianised world and a more than half-secularised Church get
          on well together. 'When they do agree, their agreement is wonderful.'
          And it is a miserable thing to reflect that about the average
          Christianity of this generation there is so very little that does
          deserve the antagonism of the world. Why should the world care to hate
          or trouble itself about a professing Church, large parts of which are
          only a bit of the world under another name? There is no need whatever
          that there should be any antagonism at all between a godless world and
          hosts of professing Christians. If you want to escape the hostility
          drop your flag, button your coat over the badge that shows that you
          belong to Christ, and do the things that the people round about you
          do, and you will have a perfectly easy and undisturbed life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, in the bad old slavery days, a Christianity that had not a
          word to say about the sin of slave-holding ran no risk of being tarred
          and feathered. Of course a Christianity in Manchester that winks hard
          at commercial immoralities is very welcome on the Exchange. Of course
          a Christianity that lets beer barrels alone may reckon upon having
          publicans for its adherents. Of course a Christianity that blesses
          flags and sings <i>Te Deums</i> over victories will get its share of
          the spoil. Why should the world hate, or persecute, or do anything but
          despise a Christianity like that, any more than a man need to care for
          a tame tiger that has had its claws pared? If the world can put a hook
          in the nostrils of leviathan, and make him play with its maidens, it
          will substitute good-nature, half contemptuous, for the hostility
          which our Master here predicts. It was out-and-out Christians that He
          said the world would hate; the world likes Christians that are like
          itself. Christian men and women! be you sure that you deserve the
          hostility which my text predicts.
        </p>
        <p>IV. And now, lastly, note how to meet this antagonism.</p>
        <p>
          Reckon it as a sign and test of true union with Jesus Christ. And so,
          if ever, by reason of our passing at the call of duty or benevolence
          outside the circle of those who sympathise with our faith and
          fundamental ideas, we encounter it more manifestly than when we 'dwell
          among our own people,' let us count the 'reproach of Christ' as a
          treasure to be proud of, and to be guarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure that it is your goodness and not your evils or your weakness,
          that men dislike. The world has a very keen eye for the
          inconsistencies and the faults of professing Christians, and it is a
          good thing that it has. The loftier your profession the sharper the
          judgment that is applied to you. Many well-meaning Christian people,
          by an injudicious use of Christian phraseology in the wrong place, and
          by the glaring contradiction between their prayers and their talks and
          their daily life, bring down a great deal of deserved hostility upon
          themselves and of discredit upon Christianity; and then they comfort
          themselves and say they are bearing the 'reproach of the Cross.' Not a
          bit of it! They are bearing the natural results of their own failings
          and faults. And it is for us to see to it that what provokes, if it
          does provoke, hostile judgments and uncharitable criticisms, insulting
          speeches and sarcasms, and the sense of our belonging to another
          regiment and having other objects, is our cleaving to Jesus Christ,
          and not the imperfections and the sins with which we so often spoil
          that cleaving. Be you careful for this, that it is Christ in you that
          men turn from, and not you yourself and your weakness and sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meet this antagonism by not dropping your standard one inch. Keep the
          flag right at the masthead. If you begin to haul it down, where are
          you going to stop? Nowhere, until you have got it draggling in the mud
          at the foot. It is of no use to try to conciliate by compromise. All
          that we shall gain by that will be, as I have said, indifference and
          contempt; all that we shall gain will be a loss to the cause. A great
          deal is said in this day, and many efforts are being made -- I cannot
          but think mistaken efforts -- by Christian people to bridge over this
          gulf in the wrong way -- that is, by trying to make out that
          Christianity in its fundamental principles does approximate a great
          deal more closely to the things that the world goes by than it really
          does. It is all vain, and the only issue of it will be that we shall
          have a decaying Christianity and a dying spiritual life. Keep the flag
          up; emphasise and accentuate the things that the world disbelieves and
          denies, not pushing them to the 'falsehood of extremes,' but not by
          one jot diminishing the clearness of our testimony by reason of the
          world's unwillingness to receive it. Our victory is to be won only
          through absolute faithfulness to Christ's ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, meet hostility with unmoved, patient, Christlike, and
          Christ-derived love and sympathy. The patient sunshine pours upon the
          glaciers and melts the thick-ribbed ice at last into sweet water. The
          patient sunshine beats upon the mist-cloud and breaks up its edges and
          scatters it at the last. And our Lord here tells us that our
          experience, if we are faithful to Him, will be like His experience, in
          that some will hearken to our word though others will persecute, and
          to some our testimony will come as a message from God that draws them
          to the Lord Himself. These are our only weapons, brethren! The only
          conqueror of the world is the love that was in Christ breathed through
          us; the only victory over suspicion, contempt, alienation, is
          pleading, persistent, long-suffering, self-denying love. The only way
          to overcome the world's hostility is by turning the world into a
          church, and that can only be done when Christ's servants oppose pity
          to wrath, love to hate, and in the strength of His life who has won us
          all by the same process, seek to win the world for Him by the
          manifestation of His victorious love in our patient love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren, to which army do you belong? Which community is yours?
          Are you in Christ's ranks, or are you in the world's? Do you love Him
          back again, or do you meet His open heart with a closed one, and His
          hand, laden with blessings, with hands clenched in refusal? To which
          class do I belong? -- it is the question of questions for us all; and
          I pray that you and I, won from our hatred by His love, and wooed out
          of our death by His life, and made partakers of His life by His death,
          may yield our hearts to Him, and so pass from out of the hostility and
          mistrust of a godless world into the friendships and peace of the
          sheltering Vine. And then we 'shall esteem the reproach of Christ' if
          it fall upon our heads, in however modified and mild a form, 'greater
          riches than the treasures of Egypt,' and 'have respect unto the
          recompense of the reward.'
        </p>
        <p>May it be so with us all!</p>
