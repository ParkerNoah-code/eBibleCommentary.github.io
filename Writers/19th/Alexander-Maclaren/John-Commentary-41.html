          'When the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the
          disciples knew not that it was Jesus.' -- JOHN xxi.4.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident recorded in this appendix to John's Gospel is separated
          from the other appearances of our risen Lord in respect of place,
          time, and purpose. They all occurred in and about Jerusalem; this took
          place in Galilee. The bulk of them happened on the day of the
          Resurrection, one of them a week after. This, of course, to allow time
          for the journey, must have been at a considerably later date. Their
          object was, mainly, to establish the reality of the Resurrection, the
          identity of Christ's physical body, and to confirm the faith of the
          disciples therein. Here, these purposes retreat into the background;
          the object of this incident is to reveal the permanent relations
          between the risen Lord and His struggling Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative is rich in details which might profitably occupy us, but
          the whole may be gathered up in two general points of view in
          considering the revelation which we have here in the participation of
          Christ in His servants' work, and also the revelation which we have in
          the preparation by Christ of a meal for His toiling servants. We take
          this whole narrative thus regarded as our subject on this Easter
          morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First we have here a revelation of the permanent relation of Jesus
          Christ to His Church and to the individuals who compose it, in this,
          that the risen Lord on the shore shares in the toil of His servants on
          the restless sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The little group of whom we read in this narrative reminds us of the
          other group of the first disciples in the first chapter of this
          Gospel. Four out of the five persons named in our text appear there:
          Simon Peter, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,
          James and John. And a very natural inference is that the 'two others'
          unnamed here are the two others of that chapter, viz. Andrew and
          Philip. If so, we have at the end, the original little group gathered
          together again; with the addition of the doubting Thomas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be that as it may, there they are on the shore of the sea, and Peter
          characteristically takes the lead and suggests a course that they all
          accept: 'I go a fishing.' 'We also go with thee.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we must not read that as if it meant: 'It is all over! Our hopes
          are vain! We dreamed that we were going to be princes in the Messiah's
          Kingdom, we have woke up to find that we are only fishermen. Let us go
          back to our nets and our boats!' No! all these men had seen the risen
          Lord, and had received from His breath the gift of the Holy Spirit.
          They had all gone from Jerusalem to Galilee, in obedience to His
          command, and were now waiting for His promised appearance. Very noble
          and beautiful is the calm patience with which they fill the time of
          expectation with doing common and long- abandoned tasks. They go back
          to the nets and the boats long since forsaken at the Master's bidding.
          That is not like fanatics. That is not like people who would be liable
          to the excesses of excitement that would lead to the 'hallucination,'
          which is the modern explanation of the resurrection faith, on the part
          of the disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is a precious lesson for us, dear brethren! that whatever may
          be our memories, and whatever may be our hopes, the very wisest thing
          we can do is to stick to the common drudgery, and even to go back to
          abandoned tasks. It stills the pulses. 'Study to be quiet; and to do
          our own business' is the best remedy for all excitement, whether it be
          of sorrow or of hope. And not seldom to us, if we will learn and
          practise that lesson, as to these poor men in the tossing fisherman's
          boat, the accustomed and daily duties will be the channel through
          which the presence of the Master will be manifested to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they go, and there follow the incidents which I need not repeat,
          because we all know them well enough. Only I wish to mark the distinct
          allusion throughout the whole narrative to the earlier story of the
          first miraculous draught of fishes which was connected with their call
          to the Apostleship, and was there by Christ declared to have a
          symbolical meaning. The correspondences and the contrasts are obvious.
          The scene is the same; the same green mountains look down upon the
          same blue waters. It was the same people that were concerned. They
          were, probably enough, in the same fishing-boat. In both there had
          been a night of fruitless toil; in both there was the command to let
          down the net once more; in both obedience was followed by
          instantaneous and large success.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much for the likenesses; the contrasts are these. In the one case
          the Master is in the boat with them, in the other He is on the shore;
          in the one the net is breaking; in the other, 'though there were so
          many, yet did it not break.' In the one Peter, smitten by a sense of
          his own sinfulness, says, 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O
          Lord!' In the other, Peter, with a deeper knowledge of his own
          sinfulness, but also with the sweet knowledge of forgiveness, casts
          himself into the sea, and flounders through the shallows to reach the
          Lord. The one is followed by the call to higher duty and to the
          abandonment of possessions; the other is followed by rest and the
          mysterious meal on the shore.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is to say, whilst both of the stories point the lesson of service
          to the Master, the one of them exhibits the principles of service to
          Him whilst He was still with them, and the other exhibits the
          principles of service to Him when He is removed from struggling and
          toiling on the billows to the calm of the peaceful shore in the
          morning light.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we may take that night of toil as full of meaning. Think of them as
          the darkness fell, and the solemn bulk of the girdling hills lay
          blacker upon the waters, and the Syrian sky was mirrored with all its
          stars sparkling in the still lake. All the night long cast after cast
          was made, and time after time the net was drawn in and nothing in it
          but tangle and mud. And when the first streak of the morning breaks
          pale over the Eastern hills they are still so absorbed in their tasks
          that they do not recognise the voice that hails them from the nearer
          shore: 'Lads, have ye any meat?' And they answer it with a half surly
          and wholly disappointed monosyllabic 'No!' It is an emblem for us all;
          weary and wet, tugging at the oar in the dark, and often seeming to
          fail. What then? If the last cast has brought nothing, try another.
          Out with the nets once more! Never mind the darkness, and the cold,
          and the wetting spray, and the weariness. You cannot expect to be as
          comfortable in a fishing-boat as in your drawing-room. You cannot
          expect that your nets will be always full. Failure and disappointment
          mingle in the most successful lives. Christian work has often to be
          done with no results at all apparent to the doer, but be sure of this,
          that they who learn and practise the homely, wholesome virtue of
          persistent adherence to the task that God sets them, will catch some
          gleams of a Presence most real and most blessed, and before they die
          will know that 'their labour has not been in vain in the Lord.' 'They
          that sow in tears shall reap in joy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, finally, about this first part of my subject, there stands out
          before us here the blessed picture of the Lord Himself, the Risen
          Lord, with the halo of death and resurrection round about Him; there,
          on the firm beach, in the increasing light of the morning, interested
          in, caring about, directing and crowning with His own blessing, the
          obedient work of His servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simple prose fact of the story, in its plain meaning, is more
          precious than any 'spiritualising' of it. Take the fact. Jesus Christ,
          fresh from the grave, who had been down into those dark regions of
          mystery where the dead sleep and wait, and had come back into this
          world, and was on the eve of ascending to the Father -- this Christ,
          the possessor of such experience, takes an interest in seven poor
          men's fishing, and cares to know whether their ragged old net is full
          or is empty. There never was a more sublime and wonderful binding
          together of the loftiest and the lowliest than in that question in the
          mouth of the Risen Lord. If men had been going to dream about what
          would be fitting language for a risen Saviour, if we had to do here
          with a legend, and not with a piece of plain, prosaic fact, do you
          think that the imagination would ever have entered the mind of the
          legend-maker to put such a question as that into such lips at such a
          time? 'Lads, have ye any meat?'
        </p>
        <p>
          It teaches us that anything that interests us is not without interest
          to Christ. Anything that is big enough to occupy our thoughts and our
          efforts is large enough to be taken into His. All our ignoble toils,
          and all our petty anxieties, touch a chord that vibrates in that deep
          and tender heart. Though other sympathy may be unable to come down to
          the minutenesses of our little lives, and to wind itself into the
          narrow room in which our histories are prisoned, Christ's sympathy can
          steal into the narrowest cranny. The risen Lord is interested in our
          poor fishing and our disappointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not only that, here is a promise for us, a prophecy for us, of
          certain guidance and direction, if only we will come to Him and
          acknowledge our dependence upon Him. The question that was put to
          them, 'Lads, have ye any meat?' was meant to evoke the answer, 'No!'
          The consciousness of my failure is the pre-requisite to my appeal to
          Him to prosper my work. And just as before He would, on the other
          margin of that same shore, multiply the loaves and the fishes, He put
          to them the question, 'How many have ye?' that they might know clearly
          the inadequacy of their own resources for the hungry crowd, so here,
          in order to prepare their hearts for the reception of His guidance and
          His blessing, He provides that they be brought to catalogue and
          confess their failures. So He does with us all, beats the
          self-confidence out of us, blessed be His name! and makes us know
          ourselves to be empty in order that He may pour Himself into us, and
          flood us with the joy of His presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes the guidance given. We may be sure that it is given to us
          all to-day, if we wait upon Him and ask Him. 'Cast the net on the
          right side of the ship, and ye shall find.' His command is followed by
          swift, unanswering, unquestioning obedience, which in its turn is
          immediately succeeded by the large blessing which the Master then gave
          on the instant, which He gives still, though often, in equal love and
          unquestioned wisdom, it comes long after faith has discerned His
          presence and obedience has bowed to His command.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be that we shall not see the results of our toil till the
          morning dawns and the great net is drawn to land by angel hands. But
          we may be sure that while we are toiling on the tossing sea, He
          watches from the shore, is interested in all our weary efforts, will
          guide us if we own to Him our weakness, and will give us to see at
          last issues greater than we had dared to hope from our poor service.
          The dying martyr looked up and saw Him 'standing at the right hand of
          God,' in the attitude of interested watchfulness and ready help. This
          Easter morning bids us lift our eyes to a risen Lord who 'has not left
          us to serve alone,' nor gone up on high, like some careless general to
          a safe height, while his forsaken soldiers have to stand the shock of
          onset without him. From this height He bends down and 'covers our
          heads in the day of battle.' 'He was received up,' says the
          Evangelist, 'and sat on the right hand of God, and they went forth and
          preached everywhere.' Strange contrast between His throned rest and
          their wandering toils for Him! But the contrast gives place to a
          deeper identity of work and condition, as the Gospel goes on to say,
          'The Lord also <i>working with them</i> and confirming the word with
          signs following.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Though we be on the tossing sea and He on the quiet shore, between us
          there is a true union and communion, His heart is with us, if our
          hearts be with Him, and from Him will pass over all strength, grace,
          and blessing to us, if only we know His presence, and owning our
          weakness, obey His command and expect His blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Look at the other half of this incident before us. I pass over the
          episode of the recognition of Jesus by John, and of Peter struggling
          to His feet, interesting as it is, in order to fix upon the central
          thought of the second part of the narrative, viz. the risen Lord on
          the shore, in the increasing light of the morning, 'preparing a table'
          for His toiling servants. That 'fire of coals' and the simple
          refreshment that was being dressed upon it had been prepared there by
          Christ's own hand. We are not told that there was anything miraculous
          about it. He had gathered the charcoal; He had procured the fish; He
          had dressed it and prepared it. They are bidden to 'bring of the fish
          they had caught'; He accepts their service, and adds the result of
          their toil, as it would seem, to the provision which His own hand has
          prepared. He summons them to a meal, not the midday repast, for it was
          still early morning. They seat themselves, smitten by a great awe. The
          meal goes on in silence. No word is spoken on either side. Their
          hearts know Him. He waits on them, making Himself their Servant as
          well as their Host. He 'taketh bread and giveth them and fish
          likewise,' as He had done in the miracles by the same shore and on
          that sad night in the upper room that seemed so far away now, and in
          the roadside inn at Emmaus, when something in His manner or action
          disclosed Him to the wondering two at the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now what does all that teach us? Two things; and first -- neglecting
          for a moment the difference between shore and sea -- here we have the
          fact of Christ's providing, even by doing menial offices, for His
          servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          These seven men were wet and weary, cold and hungry. The first thing
          they wanted when they came out of the fishing-boat was their
          breakfast. If they had been at home, their wives and children would
          have got it ready for them. Jesus had a great deal to say to them that
          day, a great deal to teach them, much to do for them, and for the
          whole world, by the words that followed; but the first thing that He
          thinks about is to feed them. And so, cherishing no overstrained
          contempt for material necessities and temporal mercies, let us
          remember that it is His hand that feeds us still, and let us be glad
          to think that this Christ, risen from the dead and with His heart full
          of the large blessings that He was going to bestow, yet paused to
          consider: 'They are coming on shore after a night's hard toil, they
          will be faint and weary; let Me feed their bodies before I begin to
          deal with their hearts and spirits.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And He will take care of you, brother! and of us all. The 'bread will
          be given' us, at any rate, and 'the water made sure.' It was a modest
          meal that He with His infinite resources thought enough for toiling
          fishermen. 'One fish,' as the original shows us, 'one loaf of bread.'
          No more! He could as easily have spread a sumptuous table for them.
          There is no covenant for superfluities, necessaries will be given. Let
          us bring down our wishes to His gifts and promises, and recognise the
          fact that 'he who needs least is the nearest the gods,' and he that
          needs least is surest of getting from Christ what he needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, besides that, the supply of all other deeper and loftier
          necessities is here guaranteed. The symbolism of our text divides,
          necessarily, the two things which in fact are not divided. It is not
          all toiling on the restless sea here, any more than it is all rest and
          fruition yonder; but all that your spirit needs, for wisdom, patience,
          heroism, righteousness, growth, Christ will give you <i>in</i> your
          work; and that is better than giving it to you after your work, and
          the very work which is blessed by Him, and furthered and prospered by
          Him, the very work itself will come to be moat and nourishment. 'Out
          of the eater will come forth meat,' and the slain 'lions' of past
          struggles and sorrows, the next time we come to them, will be 'full of
          honey.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, there is a great symbolical prophecy here if we emphasise the
          distinction between the night and the morning, between the shore and
          the sea. We can scarcely fail to catch this meaning in the incident
          which sets forth the old blessed assurance that the risen Lord is
          preparing a feast on the shore while His servants are toiling on the
          darkling sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the details, such as the solid shore in contrast with the
          changeful sea, the increasing morning in contrast with the toilsome
          night, the feast prepared, have been from of old consecrated to shadow
          forth the differences between earth and heaven. It would be blindness
          not to see here a prophecy of the glad hour when Christ shall welcome
          to their stable home, amid the brightness of unsetting day, the souls
          that have served Him amidst the fluctuations and storms of life, and
          seen Him in its darkness, and shall satisfy all their desires with the
          'bread of heaven.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Our poor work which He deigns to accept forms part of the feast which
          is spread at the end of our toil, when 'there shall be no more sea.'
          He adds the results of our toil to the feast which He has prepared.
          The consequences of what we have done here on earth make no small part
          of the blessedness of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Their works and alms and all their good endeavour<br />Stayed not
          behind, nor in the grave were trod.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The souls which a Paul or a John has won for the Master, in their
          vocation as 'fishers of men,' are their 'hope and joy and crown of
          rejoicing, in the presence of our Lord Jesus.' The great benediction
          which the Spirit bade the Apocalyptic seer write over 'the dead which
          die in the Lord,' is anticipated in both its parts by this mysterious
          meal on the beach. 'They rest from their labours' inasmuch as they
          find the food prepared for them, and sit down to partake; 'Their works
          do follow them' inasmuch as they 'bring of the fish which they have
          caught.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Christ Himself waits on them, therein fulfilling in symbol
          what He has told us in great words that dimly shadow wonders
          unintelligible until experienced: 'Verily I say unto you, He shall
          gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth,
          and serve them.'
        </p>

          So here is a vision to cheer us all. Life must be full of toil and of
          failure. We are on the midnight sea, and have to tug, weary and wet,
          at a heavy oar, and to haul an often empty net. But we do not labour
          alone. He comes to us across the storm, and is with us in the night, a
          most real, because unseen Presence. If we accept the guidance of His
          directing word, His indwelling Spirit, and His all-sufficient example,
          and seek to ascertain His will in outward Providences, we shall not be
          left to waste our strength in blunders, nor shall our labour be in
          vain. In the morning light we shall see Him standing serene on the
          steadfast shore. The 'Pilot of the Galilean lake' will guide our frail
          boat through the wild surf that marks the breaking of the sea of life
          on the shore of eternity; and when the sun rises over the Eastern
          hills we shall land on the solid beach, bringing our 'few small
          fishes' with us, which He will accept. And there we shall rest, nor
          need to ask who He is that serves us, for we shall know that 'It is
          the Lord!'
