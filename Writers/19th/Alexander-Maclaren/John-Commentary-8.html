          'But when the Comforter Is come, whom I will send unto you from the
          Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He
          shall testify of Me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have
          been with Me from the beginning.' -- JOHN xv.26, 27.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord has been speaking of a world hostile to His followers and to
          Him. He proceeds, in the words which immediately follow our text, to
          paint that hostility as aggravated even to the pitch of religious
          murder. But here He lets a beam of light in upon the darkness. These
          forlorn Twelve, listening to Him, might well have said, 'Thou art
          about to leave us; how can we alone face this world in arms, with
          which Thou dost terrify us?' And here He lets them see that they will
          not be left alone, but have a great Champion, clad in celestial
          armour, who, coming straight from God, will be with them and put into
          their hands a weapon, with which they may conquer the world, and turn
          it into a friend, and with which alone they must meet the world's
          hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, we have three things in this text; the great promise of an
          Ally in the conflict with the world; the witness which that Ally
          bears, to fortify against the world; and the consequent witness with
          which Christians may win the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Now consider briefly the first of these points, the great promise
          of an Ally in the conflict with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may touch, very lightly, upon the wonderful designation of this
          Champion-Friend whom Christ sends, because on former occasions in this
          course of sermons we have had to deal with the same thoughts, and
          there will be subsequent opportunities of recurring to them. But I may
          just emphasise in a few sentences the points which our Lord here
          signalises in regard to the Champion whom He sends. There is a double
          designation of that Spirit, 'the Comforter' and 'the Spirit of truth.'
          There is a double description of His mission, as being 'sent' by
          Jesus, and as 'proceeding from the Father,' and there is a single
          statement as to the position from which He comes to us. A word about
          each of these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already explained in former sermons that the notion of
          'Comforter,' as it is understood in modern English, is a great deal
          too restricted and narrow to cover the whole ground of this great and
          blessed promise. The Comforter whom Christ sends is no mere drier of
          men's tears and gentle Consoler of human sorrows, but He is a mightier
          Spirit than that, and the word by which He is described in our text,
          which means 'one who is summoned to the side of another,' conveys the
          idea of a helper who is brought to the man to be helped, in order to
          render whatever aid and succour that man's weakness and circumstances
          may require. The verses before our text suggest what sort of aid and
          succour the disciples will need. They are to be as sheep in the midst
          of wolves. Their defenceless purity will need a Protector, a strong
          Shepherd. They stand alone amongst enemies. There must be some one
          beside them to fight for them, to shield and to encourage them, to be
          their Safety and their Peace. And that Paraclete, who is called to our
          side, comes for the special help which these special circumstances
          require, and is a strong Spirit who will be our Champion and our Ally,
          whatever antagonism may storm against us, and however strong and
          well-armed may be the assaulting legions of the world's hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, still further, the other designation here of this strong
          Succourer and Friend is 'the Spirit of truth,' by which is designated,
          not so much His characteristic attribute, as rather the weapon which
          He wields, or the material with which He works. The 'truth' is His
          instrument; that is to say, the Spirit of God sent by Jesus Christ is
          the Strengthener, the Encourager, the Comforter, the Fighter for us
          and with us, because He wields that great body of truth, the perfect
          revelation of God, and man, and duty, and salvation, which is embodied
          in the incarnation and work of Jesus Christ our Lord. The truth is His
          weapon, and it is by it that He makes us strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, still further, there is a twofold description here of the
          mission of this divine Champion, as 'sent' by Christ, and 'proceeding
          from the Father.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the former, I need only remind you that, in a previous
          part of this wonderful discourse, our Lord speaks of that divine
          Spirit as being sent by the Father in His name and in answer to His
          prayer. The representation here is by no means antagonistic to, or
          diverse from, that other representation, but rather the fact that the
          Father and the Son, according to the deep teaching of Scripture, are
          in so far one as that 'whatsoever the Son seeth the Father do that
          also the Son doeth likewise,' makes it possible to attribute to Him
          the work which, in another place, is ascribed to the Father. In
          speaking of the <i>Persons</i> of the Deity, let us never forget that
          that word is only partially applicable to that ineffable Being, and
          that whilst with us it implies absolute separation of individuals, it
          does not mean such separation in the case of its imperfect
          transference to the mysteries of the divine nature; but rather, the
          Son doeth what the Father doeth, and therefore the Spirit is sent
          forth by the Father, and also the Son sends the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, on the other hand, we are not to regard that divine Spirit as
          merely a Messenger sent by another. He 'proceeds from the Father.'
          That word has been the battlefield of theological controversy, with
          which I do not purpose to trouble you now. For I do not suppose that
          in its use here it refers at all to the subject to which it has been
          sometimes applied, nor contains any kind of revelation of the eternal
          depths of the divine Nature and its relations to itself. What is meant
          here is the historical coming forth into human life of that divine
          Spirit. And, possibly, the word 'proceeds' is chosen in order to
          contrast with the word 'sent,' and to give the idea of a voluntary and
          personal action of the Messenger, who not only is <i>sent</i> by the
          Father, but of Himself <i>proceeds</i> on the mighty work to which He
          is destined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be that as it may, mark only, for the last thought here about the
          details of this great promise, that wonderful phrase, twice repeated
          in our Lord's words, and emphasised by its verbal repetition in the
          two clauses, which in all other respects are so different -- 'from the
          Father.' The word translated '<i>from</i>' is not the ordinary word so
          rendered, but rather designates <i>a position at the side of</i> than
          an <i>origin from</i>, and suggests much rather the intimate and
          ineffable union between Father, Son, and Spirit, than the source from
          which the Spirit comes. I touch upon these things very lightly, and
          gather them up into one sentence. Here, then, are the points. A Person
          who is spoken of as 'He' -- a divine Person whose home from of old has
          been close by the Father's side -- a Person whose instrument is the
          revealed truth ensphered and in germ in the facts of Christ's
          incarnation and life -- a divine Person, wielding the truth, who is
          sent by Christ as His Representative, and in some sense a continuance
          of His personal Presence -- a divine, personal Spirit coming from the
          Father, wielding the truth, sent by Christ, and at the side of all the
          persecuted and the weak, all world-hated and Christian men, as their
          Champion, their Combatant, their Ally, their Inspiration, and their
          Power. Is not that enough to make the weakest strong? Is not that
          enough to make us 'more than conquerors through Him that loved us'?
          All nations have legends of the gods fighting at the head of their
          armies, and through the dust of battle the white horses and the
          shining armour of the celestial champions have been seen. The childish
          dream is a historical reality. It is not we that fight, it is the
          Spirit of God that fighteth in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And so note, secondly, the witness of the Spirit which fortifies
          against the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He shall bear witness of Me.' Now we must especially observe here
          that little phrase, 'unto you.' For that tells us at once that the
          witness which our Lord has in mind here is something which is done
          within the circle of the Christian believers, and not in the wide
          field of the world's history or in nature. Of course it is a great
          truth that long before Jesus Christ, and to-day far beyond the limits
          of His name and knowledge, to say nothing of His faith and obedience,
          the Spirit of God is working. As of old He brooded over the chaotic
          darkness, ever labouring to turn chaos into order, and darkness into
          light, and deformity into beauty; so today, all over the field of
          humanity, He is operating. Grand as that truth is, it is not the truth
          here. What is spoken of here is something that is done in and on
          Christian men, and not even through them on the world, but in them for
          themselves. 'He shall testify of Me' to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is to be noted, also, that the first and special application of
          these words is to the little group listening to Him. Never were men
          more desolate and beaten down than these were, in the prospect of
          Christ's departure. Never were men more utterly bewildered and
          dispirited than these were, in the days between His crucifixion and
          His resurrection. Think of them during His earthly life, their narrow
          understandings, their manifold faults, moral as well as intellectual.
          How little perception they had of anything that He said to them, as
          their own foolish questions abundantly show! How little they had drunk
          in His spirit, as their selfish and ambitious janglings amongst
          themselves abundantly show! They were but Jews like their brethren,
          believing, indeed, that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, but not knowing
          what it was that they believed, or of what kind the Messiah was in
          whom they were thus partially trusting. But they loved Him and were
          led by Him, and so they were brought into a larger place by the Spirit
          whom Christ sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was it that made these dwarfs into giants in six weeks? What was
          it that turned their narrowness into breadth; that made them start up
          all at once as heroes, and that so swiftly matured them, as the fruits
          and flowers are ripened under tropical sunshine? The resurrection and
          ascension of Jesus Christ had a great deal to do with the change; but
          they were not its whole cause. There is no explanation of the
          extraordinary transformation of these men as we see them in the pages
          of the Gospels, and as we find them on the pages of the Acts of the
          Apostles, except this -- the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus
          Christ as facts, and the Spirit on Pentecost as an indwelling
          Interpreter of the facts. He came, and the weak became strong, and the
          foolish wise, and the blind enlightened, and they began to understand
          -- though it needed all their lives to perfect the teaching, -- what
          it was that their ignorant hands had grasped and their dim perceptions
          had seen, when they touched the hands and looked upon the face of
          Jesus Christ. The witness of the Spirit of God working within them,
          working upon what they knew of the historical facts of Christ's life,
          and interpreting these to them, was the explanation of their change
          and growth. And the New Testament is the product of that change.
          Christ's life was the truth which the Spirit used, and a product of
          His teaching was these Epistles which we have, and which for us step
          into the place which the historical facts held for them, and become
          the instrument with which the Spirit of God will deepen our
          understanding of Christ and enlarge our knowledge of what He is to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear friends, whilst here we have a promise which specially
          applies, no doubt, to these twelve Apostles, and the result of which
          in them was different from its result in us, inasmuch as the Spirit's
          teaching, recorded in the New Testament, becomes for us the
          authoritative rule of faith and practice, the promise still applies to
          each of us in a secondary and modified sense. For there is nothing in
          these great valedictory words of our Lord's which has not a universal
          bearing, and is not the revelation of a permanent truth in regard to
          the Christian Church. And, therefore, here we have the promise of a
          universal gift to all Christian men and women, of an actual divine
          Spirit to dwell with each of us, to speak in our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what will He speak there? He will teach us a deeper knowledge of
          Jesus Christ. He will help us to understand better what He is. He will
          show us more and more of the whole sweep of His work, of the whole
          infinite truth for morals and religion, for politics and society, for
          time and for eternity, about men and about God, which is wrapped up in
          that great saying which we first of all, perhaps under the pressure of
          our own sense of sin, grasp as our deliverance from sin: 'God so loved
          the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
          in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' That is the sum
          of truth which the Spirit of God interprets to every faithful heart.
          And as the days roll on, and new problems rise, and new difficulties
          present themselves, and new circumstances emerge in our personal life,
          we find the truth, which we at first dimly grasped as life and
          salvation, opening out into wisdom and depth and meaning that we never
          dreamed of in the early hours. A Spirit that bears witness of Christ
          and will make us understand Him better every day we live, if we
          choose, is the promise that is given here, for all Christian men and
          women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then note that this inward witness of Christ's depth and preciousness
          is our true weapon and stay against a hostile world. A little candle
          in a room will make the lightning outside almost invisible; and if I
          have burning in my heart the inward experience and conviction of what
          Jesus Christ is and what He has done and will do for me -- Oh! then,
          all the storm without may rage, and it will not trouble me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you take an empty vessel and bring pressure to bear upon it, in go
          the sides. Fill it, and they will resist the pressure. So with growing
          knowledge of Christ, and growing personal experience of His sweetness
          in our souls, we shall be able, untouched and undinted, to throw off
          the pressure which would otherwise have crushed us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, dear friends, here is the true secret of tranquillity, in
          an age of questioning and doubt. Let me have that divine Voice
          speaking in my heart, as I may have, and no matter what questions may
          be doubtful, this is sure -- 'We know in whom we have believed'; and
          we can say, 'Settle all your controversies any way you like: one thing
          I know, and that divine Voice is ever saying it to me in my deepest
          consciousness -- the Son of God is come and hath given us an
          understanding that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him
          that is true.' Labour for more of this inward, personal conviction of
          the preciousness of Jesus Christ to strengthen you against a hostile
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And remember that there are conditions under which this Voice speaks
          in our souls. One is that we attend to the instrument which the Spirit
          of God uses, and that is 'the truth.' If Christians will not read
          their Bibles, they need not expect to have the words of these Bibles
          interpreted and made real to them by any inward experience. If you
          want to have a faith which is vindicated and warranted by your daily
          experience, there is only one way to get it, and that is, to use the
          truth which the Spirit uses, and to bring yourself into contact,
          continual and reverent and intelligent, with the great body of divine
          truth that is conveyed in these authoritative words of the Spirit of
          God speaking through the first witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there must be moral discipline too. Laziness, worldliness, the
          absorption of attention with other things, self-conceit, prejudice,
          and, I was going to say, almost above all, the taking of our religion
          and religious opinions at secondhand from men and teachers and books
          -- all these stand in the way of our hearing the Spirit of God when He
          speaks. Come away from the babble and go by yourself, and take your
          Bibles with you, and read them, and meditate upon them, and get near
          the Master of whom they speak, and the Spirit which uses the truth
          will use it to fortify you.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And, lastly, note the consequent witness with which the Christian
          may win the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And ye also shall bear witness of Me, because ye have been with Me
          from the beginning.' That 'also' has, of course, direct reference to
          the Apostles' witness to the facts of our Lord's historical
          appearance, His life, His death, His resurrection, and His ascension;
          and therefore their qualification was simply the companionship with
          Him which enabled them to say, 'We saw what we tell you; we were
          witnesses from the beginning.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, again, I say that there is no word here that belongs only to
          the Apostles; it belongs to us all, and so here is the task of the
          Christian Church in all its members. They receive the witness of the
          Spirit, and they are Christ's witnesses in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note what we have to do -- to bear witness; not to argue, not to
          adorn, but simply to attest. Note what we have to attest -- the fact,
          not of the historical life of Jesus Christ, because we are not in a
          position to be witnesses of that, but the fact of His preciousness and
          power, and the fact of our own experience of what He has done for us.
          Note, that that is by far the most powerful agency for winning the
          world. You can never make men angry by saying to them, 'We have found
          tho Messias.' You cannot irritate people, or provoke them into a
          controversial opposition when you say, 'Brother, let me tell you my
          experience. I was dark, sad, sinful, weak, solitary, miserable; and I
          got light, gladness, pardon, strength, companionship, and a joyful
          hope. I was blind -- you remember me when my eyes were dark, and I sat
          begging outside the Temple; I was blind, now I see -- look at my
          eyeballs.' We can all say that. This is the witness that needs no
          eloquence, no genius, no anything except honesty and experience; and
          whosoever has tasted and felt and handled of the Word of Life may
          surely go to a brother and say, 'Brother, I have eaten and am
          satisfied. Will you not help yourselves?' We can all do it, and we
          ought to do it. The Christian privilege of being witnessed to by the
          Spirit of God in our hearts brings with it the Christian duty of being
          witnesses in our turn to the world. That is our only weapon against
          the hostility which godless humanity bears to ourselves and to our
          Master. We may win men by that; we can win them by nothing else. 'Ye
          are My witnesses, saith the Lord, and My servants whom I have chosen.'
          Christian friend, listen to the Master, who says, 'Him that confesseth
          Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father in heaven.'
