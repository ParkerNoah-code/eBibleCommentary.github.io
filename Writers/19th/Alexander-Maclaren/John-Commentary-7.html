          'But all these things will they do unto you for My name's sake,
          because they know not Him that sent Me. If I had not come and spoken
          unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their
          sin. He that hateth Me, hateth My Father also. If I had not done among
          them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now
          have they both seen and hated both Me and My Father. But this cometh
          to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their
          law, They hated Me without a cause.' -- JOHN XV.21-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord has been speaking of the world's hostility to His followers,
          and tracing that to its hostility to Himself. In these solemn words of
          our text He goes still deeper, and parallels the relation which His
          disciples bear to Him and the consequent hostility that falls on them,
          with the relation which He bears to the Father and the consequent
          hostility that falls on Him: 'They hate you because they hate Me.' And
          then His words become sadder and pierce deeper, and with a tone of
          wounded love and disappointed effort and almost surprise at the
          world's requital to Him, He goes on to say, 'They hate Me, because
          they hate the Father.'
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, here we have, in very pathetic and solemn words, Christ's
          view of the relation of the world to Him and to God.
        </p>
        <p>I. The first point that He signalises is the world's ignorance.</p>
        <p>
          'These things they will do unto you,' and they will do them 'for My
          name's sake'; they will do them 'because they know not Him that sent
          Me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'The world,' in Christ's language, is the aggregate of godless men.
          Or, to put it a little more sharply, our Lord, in this context, gives
          in His full adhesion to that narrow view which divides those who have
          come under the influence of His truth into two portions. There is no
          mincing of the matter in the antithesis which Christ here draws; no
          hesitation, as if there were a great central mass, too bad for a
          blessing perhaps, but too good for a curse; which was neither black
          nor white, but neutral grey. No! however it may be with the masses
          beyond the reach of the dividing and revealing power of His truth, the
          men that come into contact with Him, like a heap of metal filings
          brought into contact with a magnet, mass themselves into two bunches,
          the one those who yield to the attraction, and the other those who do
          not. The one is 'My disciples,' and the other is 'the world.' And now,
          says Jesus Christ, all that mass that stands apart from Him, and,
          having looked upon Him with the superficial eye of those men round
          about Him at that day, or of the men who hear of Him now, have no real
          love to Him -- have, as the underlying motive of their conduct and
          their feelings, a real ignorance of God, 'They know not Him that sent
          Me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord assumes that He is so completely the Copy and Revealer of the
          divine nature as that any man that looks upon Him has had the
          opportunity of becoming acquainted with God, and that any man who
          turns away from Him has lost that opportunity. The God that the men
          who do not love Jesus Christ believe in, is not the Father that sent
          Him. It is a fragment, a distorted image tinted by the lens. The world
          has its conception of God; but outside of Jesus Christ and His
          manifestation of the whole divine nature, the world's God is but a
          syllable, a fragment, a broken part of the perfect completeness. 'The
          Father of an infinite majesty,' and of as infinite a tenderness, the
          stooping God, the pitying God, the forgiving God, the loving God is
          known only where Christ is accepted. In other hearts He may be dimly
          hoped for, in other hearts He may be half believed in, in other hearts
          He may be thought possible; but hopes and anticipations and fears and
          doubts are not knowledge, and they who see not the light in Christ see
          but the darkness. Out of Him God is not known, and they that turn away
          from His beneficent manifestation turn their faces to the black north,
          from which no sun can shine. Brother, do you know God in Christ?
          Unless you do, you do not know the God who is.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is a deeper meaning in that word than simply the possession
          of true thoughts concerning the divine nature. We know God as we know
          one another; because God is a Person, as we are persons, and the only
          way to know persons is through familiar acquaintance and sympathy. So
          the world which turns away from Christ has no acquaintance with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a surface fact. Our Lord goes on to show what lies below it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. His second thought here is -- the world's ignorance in the face of
          Christ's light is worse than ignorance; it is sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark how He speaks: 'If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had
          not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.' And then
          again: 'If I had not done amongst them the works which none other men
          did, they had not had sin.' So then He puts before us two forms of His
          manifestation of the divine nature, by His words and His works. Of
          these two He puts His words foremost, as being a deeper and more
          precious and brilliant revelation of what God is than are His
          miracles. The latter are subordinate, they come as a second source of
          illumination. Men who will not see the beauty and listen to the truth
          that lie in His word may perchance be led by His deed. But the word
          towers in its nature high above the work, and the miracle to the word
          is but like the picture in the child's book to the text, fit for
          feeble eyes and infantile judgments, but containing far less of the
          revelation of God than the sacred words which He speaks. First the
          words, next the miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But notice, too, how decisively, and yet simply and humbly and
          sorrowfully, our Lord here makes a claim which, on the lips of any but
          Himself, would have been mere madness of presumption. Think of any of
          us saying that our words made all the difference between innocent
          ignorance and criminality! Think of any of us saying that to listen to
          us, and not be persuaded, was the sin of sins! Think of any of us
          pointing to our actions and saying, In these God is so manifest that
          not to see Him augurs wickedness, and is condemnation! And yet Jesus
          Christ says all this. And, what is more wonderful, nobody wonders that
          He says it, and the world believes that He is saying the truth when He
          says it.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does that come? There is only one answer; only one. His words were
          the illuminating manifestation of God, and His deeds were the plain
          and unambiguous operation of the divine hand then and there, only
          because He Himself was divine, and in Him 'God was manifested in the
          flesh.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But passing from that, notice how our Lord here declares that in
          comparison with the sin of not listening to His words, and being
          taught by His manifestation, all other sins dwindle into nothing. 'If
          I had not spoken, they had not had sin.' That does not mean, of
          course, that these men would have been clear of all moral delinquency;
          it does not mean that there would not have been amongst them crimes
          against their own consciences, crimes against the law written on their
          own hearts, crimes against the law of revelation. There were liars,
          impure men, selfish men, and men committing all the ordinary forms of
          human transgression amongst them. And yet, says Christ, black and
          bespattered as these natures are, they are white in comparison with
          the blackness of the man who, looking into His face, sees nothing
          there that he should desire. Beside the mountain belching out its
          sulphurous flame the little pimple of a molehill is nought. And so,
          says Christ, heaven heads the count of sins with this -- unbelief in
          Me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, brother, as light grows responsibility grows, and this is the
          misery of all illumination that comes through Jesus Christ, that where
          it does not draw a man into His sweet love, and fill him with the
          knowledge of God which is eternal life, it darkens his nature and
          aggravates his condemnation, and lays a heavier burden upon his soul.
          The truth that the measure of light is the measure of guilt has many
          aspects. It turns a face of alleviation to the dark places of the
          earth; but just in the measure that it lightens the condemnation of
          the heathen, it adds weight to the condemnation of you men and women
          who are bathed in the light of Christianity, and all your days have
          had it streaming in upon you. The measure of the guilt is the
          brightness of the light. No shadows are so black as those which the
          intense sunshine of the tropics casts. And you and I live in the very
          tropical regions of divine revelation, and 'if we turn away from Him
          that spoke on earth and speaketh from heaven, of how much sorer
          punishment, think you, shall we be thought worthy' than those who live
          away out in the glimmering twilight of an unevangelised paganism, or
          who stood by the side of Jesus Christ when they had only His earthly
          life to teach them?
        </p>
        <p>III. The ignorance which is sin is the manifestation of hatred.</p>
        <p>
          Our Lord has sorrowfully contemplated the not knowing God, which in
          the blaze of His light can only come from wilful closing of the eyes,
          and is therefore the very sin of sins. But that, sad as it is, is not
          all which has to be said about that blindness of unbelief in Him. It
          indicates a rooted alienation of heart and mind and will from God, and
          is, in fact, the manifestation of an unconscious but real hatred. It
          is an awful saying, and one which the lips 'into which grace was
          poured' could not pronounce without a sigh. But it is our wisdom to
          listen to what it was His mercy to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe our Lord's identification of Himself with the Father, so as
          that the feelings with which men regard Him are, <i>ipso facto</i>,
          the feelings with which they regard the Father God. 'He that hath seen
          Me hath seen the Father.' 'He that hath loved Me hath loved the
          Father.' 'He that hath hated Me hath hated the Father.' An ugly word
          -- a word that a great many of us think far too severe and harsh to be
          applied to men who simply are indifferent to the divine love. Some
          say, 'I am conscious of no hatred. I do not pretend to be a Christian,
          but I do not hate God. Take the ordinary run of people round about us
          in the world; if you say God is not in all their thoughts, I agree
          with you; but if you say that they <i>hate</i> God, I do not believe
          it.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, what do you think the fact that men go through their days and
          weeks and months and years, and have not God in all their thoughts,
          indicates as to the central feeling of their hearts towards God?
          Granted that there is not actual antagonism, because there is no
          thought at all, do you think it would be possible for a man who loved
          God to go on for a twelvemonth and never think of, or care to please,
          or desire to be near, the object that he loved? And inasmuch as, deep
          down at the bottom of our moral being, there is no such thing possible
          as indifference and a perfect equipoise in reference to God, it is
          clear enough, I think, that -- although the word must not be pressed
          as if it meant conscious and active antagonism, -- where there is no
          love there is hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a man does not love God as He is revealed to him in Jesus Christ,
          he neither cares to please Him nor to think about Him, nor does he
          order his life in obedience to His commands. And if it be true that
          obedience is the very life-breath of love, disobedience or non-
          obedience is the manifestation of antagonism, and antagonism towards
          God is the same thing as hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, I want some of my hearers to-day who have never honestly
          asked themselves the question of what their relation to God is, to go
          down into the deep places of their hearts and test themselves by this
          simple inquiry: 'Do I do anything to please Him? Do I try to serve
          Him? Is it a joy to me to be near Him? Is the thought of Him a
          delight, like a fountain in the desert or the cool shadow of a great
          rock in the blazing wilderness? Do I turn to Him as my Home, my
          Friend, my All? If I do not, am I not deceiving myself by fancying
          that I stand neutral?' There is no neutrality in a man's relation to
          God. It is one thing or other. 'Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.' 'The
          friendship of the world is enmity against God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. And now, lastly, note how our Lord here touches the deep thought
          that this ignorance, which is sin, and is more properly named hatred,
          is utterly irrational and causeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          'All this will they do that it might be fulfilled which is written in
          their law, They hated Me without a cause.' One hears sighing through
          these words the Master's meek wonder that His love should be so met,
          and that the requital which He receives at men's hands, for such an
          unexampled and lavish outpouring of it, should be such a carelessness,
          reposing upon a hidden basis of such a rooted alienation.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Without a cause'; yes! that suggests the deep thought that the most
          mysterious and irrational thing in men's whole history and experience
          is the way in which they recompense God in Christ for what He has done
          for them. 'Be astonished, O ye heavens! and wonder, O ye earth!' said
          one of the old prophets; the mystery of mysteries, which can give no
          account of itself to satisfy reason, which has no apology, excuse, or
          vindication, is just that when God loves me I do not love Him back
          again; and that when Christ pours out the whole fullness of His heart
          upon me, nay dull and obstinate heart gives back so little to Him who
          has given me so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Without a cause.' Think of that Cross; think, as every poor creature
          on earth has a right to think, that he and she individually were in
          the mind and heart of the Saviour when He suffered and died, and then
          think of what we have brought Him for it. De we not stand ashamed at-
          if I might use so trivial a word, -- the absurdity as well as at the
          criminality of our requital? Causeless love on the one side,
          occasioned by nothing but itself, and causeless indifference on the
          other, occasioned by nothing but itself, are the two powers that meet
          in this mystery-men's rejection of the infinite love of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friend, come away from the unreasonable people, come away from the
          men who can give no account of their attitude. Come away from those
          who pay benefits by carelessness, and a Love that died by an
          indifference that will not cast an eye upon that miracle of mercy, and
          let His love kindle the answering flame in your hearts. Then you will
          know God as only they who love Christ know Him, and in the sweetness
          of a mutual bond will lose the misery of self, and escape the
          deepening condemnation of those who see Christ on the Cross and do not
          care for the sight, nor learn by it to know the infinite tenderness
          and holiness of the Father that sent Him.
