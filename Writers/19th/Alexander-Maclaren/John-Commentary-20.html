          'These words spake Jesus, and lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said,
          Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may
          glorify Thee: As Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that He
          should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him. And this
          is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and
          Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent. I have glorified Thee on the earth:
          I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do. And now, O
          Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own Self with the glory which I had
          with Thee before the world was. I have manifested Thy name unto the
          men which Thou gavest Me out of the world: Thine they were, and Thou
          gavest them Me; and they have kept Thy word. Now they have known that
          all things whatsoever Thou hast given Me, are of Thee. For I have
          given unto them the words which Thou gavest Me; and they have received
          them, and have known surely that I came out from Thee, and they have
          believed that Thou didst send Me. I pray for them: I pray not for the
          world, but for them which Thou hast given Me; for they are Thine. And
          all Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine; and I am glorified in them.
          And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I
          come to Thee. Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou
          hast given Me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them
          in the world, I kept them in Thy name: those that Thou gavest Me I
          have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that
          the Scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I to Thee; and these
          things I speak in the world, that they might have My joy fulfilled in
          themselves. I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them,
          because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I
          pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou
          shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as
          I am not of the world. Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is
          truth. As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent
          them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they
          also might be sanctified through the truth.' -- JOHN xvii.1-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may well despair of doing justice to the deep thoughts of this
          prayer, which volumes would not exhaust. Who is worthy to speak or to
          write about such sacred words? Perhaps we may best gain some glimpses
          of their great and holy sublimity by trying to gather their teaching
          round the centres of the three petitions, 'glorify' (vs.1, 5), 'keep'
          (v.11), and 'sanctify' (v.17).
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In verses 1-5, Jesus prays for Himself, that He may be restored to
          His pre-incarnate glory; but yet the prayer desires not so much that
          glory as affecting Himself, as His being fitted thereby for completing
          His work of manifesting the Father. There are three main points in
          these verses-the petition, its purpose, and its grounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the first, the repetition of the request in verses 1 and 5 is
          significant, especially if we note that in the former the language is
          impersonal, 'Thy Son,' and continues so till verse 4, where 'I' and
          'Me' appear. In verses 1-3, then, the prayer rests upon the ideal
          relations of Father and Son, realised in Jesus, while in verses 4 and
          5 the personal element is emphatically presented. The two petitions
          are in their scope identical. The 'glorifying' in the former is more
          fully explained in the latter as being that which He possessed in that
          ineffable fellowship with the Father, not merely before incarnation,
          but before creation. In His manhood He possessed and manifested the
          'glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and
          truth'; but that glory, lustrous though it was, was pale, and
          humiliation compared with the light inaccessible, which shone around
          the Eternal Word in the bosom of the Father. Yet He who prayed was the
          same Person who had walked in that light before time was, and now in
          human flesh asked for what no mere manhood could bear. The first form
          of the petition implies that such a partaking in the uncreated glory
          of the Father is the natural prerogative of One who is 'the Son,'
          while the second implies that it is the appropriate recompense of the
          earthly life and character of the man Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The petition not only reveals the conscious divinity of the Son, but
          also His willing acceptance of the Cross; for the glorifying sought is
          that reached through death, resurrection, and ascension, and that
          introductory clause, 'the hour is come,' points to the impending
          sufferings as the first step in the answer to the petition. The
          Crucifixion is always thus treated in this Gospel, as being both the
          lowest humiliation and the 'lifting up' of the Son; and here He is
          reaching out His hand, as it were, to draw His sufferings nearer. So
          willingly and desiringly did this Isaac climb the mount of sacrifice.
          Both elements of the great saying in the Epistle to the Hebrews are
          here: 'For the joy that was set before Him, [He] endured the Cross.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the petition is to be noted; namely, the Son's
          glorifying of the Father. No taint of selfishness corrupted His
          prayer. Not for Himself, but for men, did He desire His glory. He
          sought return to that serene and lofty seat, and the elevation of His
          limited manhood to the throne, not because He was wearied of earth or
          impatient of weakness, sorrows, or limitations, but that He might more
          fully manifest by that Glory, the Father's name. To make the Father
          known is to make the Father glorious; for He is all fair and lovely.
          That revelation of divine perfection, majesty, and sweetness was the
          end of Christ's earthly life, and is the end of His heavenly divine
          activity. He needs to reassume the prerogatives of which He needed to
          divest Himself, and both necessities have one end. He had to lay aside
          His garments and assume the form of a servant, that He might make God
          known; but, that revelation being complete, He must take His garments
          and sit down again, before He can go on to tell all the meaning of
          what He has 'done unto us.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground of the petition is twofold. Verses 2 and 3 represent the
          glory sought for, as the completion of the Son's mission and task.
          Already He had been endowed with 'authority over all flesh,' for the
          purpose of bestowing eternal life; and that eternal life stands in the
          knowledge of God, which is the same as the knowledge of Christ. The
          present gift to the Son and its purpose are thus precisely parallel
          with the further gift desired, and that is the necessary carrying out
          of this. The authority and office of the incarnate Christ demand the
          glory of, and consequent further manifestation by, the glorified
          Christ. The life which He comes to give is a life which flows from the
          revelation that He makes of the Father, received, not as mere
          intellectual knowledge, but as loving acquaintance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second ground for the petition is in verse 4, the actual perfect
          fulfilment by the Son of that mission. What untroubled consciousness
          of sinless obedience and transparent shining through His life of the
          Father's likeness and will He must have had, who could thus assert His
          complete realisation of that Father's revealing purpose, as the ground
          of His deserving and desiring participation in the divine glory!
          Surely such words are either the acme of self-righteousness or the
          self-revealing speech of the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. With verse 6 we pass to the more immediate reference to the
          disciples, and the context from thence to verse 15 may be regarded as
          all clustered round the second petition 'keep' (v.11). That central
          request is preceded and followed by considerations of the disciples'
          relation to Christ and to the world, which may be regarded as its
          grounds. The whole context preceding the petition may be summed up in
          two grounds for the prayer -- the former set forth at length, and the
          latter summarily; the one being the genuine, though incomplete
          discipleship of the men for whom Christ prays (vs.6-10), and the
          latter their desolate condition without Jesus (v.11).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is beautiful to see how our Lord here credits the disciples with
          genuine grasp, both in heart and head, of His teaching. He had shortly
          before had to say, 'Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast
          thou not known Me?' and soon 'they all forsook Him and fled.' But
          beneath misconception and inadequate apprehension there lived faith
          and love; and He saw 'the full corn in the ear,' when only the green
          'blade' was visible, pushing itself above the surface. We may take
          comfort from this generous estimate of imperfect disciples. If He did
          not tend, instead of quenching, 'dimly burning wicks,' where would He
          have 'lights in the world?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Verse 6 lays down the beginning of discipleship as threefold: Christ's
          act in revealing; the Father's, in giving men to Jesus; and men's, in
          keeping the Father's word. 'Thy word' is the whole revelation by
          Christ, which is, as this Gospel so often repeats, not His own, but
          the Father's. These three facts underlying discipleship are pleas for
          the petition to follow; for unless the feeble disciples are 'kept' in
          the name, as in a fortress, Christ's work of revelation is
          neutralised, the Father's gift to Him made of none effect, and the
          incipient disciples will not 'keep' His word. The plea is, in effect,
          'Forsake not the works of thine own hands'; and, like all Christ's
          prayers, it has a promise in its depths, since God does not begin what
          He will not finish; and it has a warning, too, that we cannot keep
          ourselves unless a stronger Hand keeps us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verses 7 and 8 carry on the portraiture of discipleship, and thence
          draw fresh pleas. The blessed result of accepting Christ's revelation
          is a knowledge, built on happy experience, and, like the acquaintance
          of heart with heart, issuing in the firm conviction that Christ's
          words and deeds are from God. Why does He say, 'All things whatsoever
          Thou hast given,' instead of simply 'that I have' or 'declare'?
          Probably it is the natural expression of His consciousness, the lowly
          utterance of His obedience, claiming nothing as His own, and yet
          claiming all, while the subsequent clause 'are of Thee' expresses the
          disciples' conviction. In like fashion our Lord, in verse 8, declares
          that His words, in their manifoldness (contrast v.6, 'Thy word'), were
          all received by Him from the Father, and accepted by the disciples,
          with the result that they came, as before, to 'know' by inward
          acquaintance with Him as a person, and so to have the divinity of His
          Person certified by experience, and further came to 'believe' that God
          had sent Him, which was a conviction arrived at by faith. So
          knowledge, which is personal experience and acquaintance, and faith,
          which rises to the heights of the Father's purpose, come from the
          humble acceptance of the Christ declaring the Father's name. First
          faith, then knowledge, and then a fuller faith built on it, and that
          faith in its turn passing into knowledge (v.25) -- these are the
          blessings belonging to the growth of true discipleship, and are
          discerned by the loving eye of Jesus in very imperfect followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In verse 9 Jesus assumes the great office of Intercessor. 'I pray for
          them' is not so much prayer as His solemn presentation of Himself
          before the Father as the High-priest of His people. It marks an epoch
          in His work. The task of bringing God to man is substantially
          complete. That of bringing men by supplication to God is now to begin.
          It is the revelation of the permanent office of the departed Lord.
          Moses on the Mount holds up the rod, and Israel prevails (Exod.
          xvii.9). The limitation of this prayer to the disciples applies only
          to the special occasion, and has no bearing on the sweep of His
          redeeming purpose or the desires of His all-pitying heart. The reasons
          for His intercession follow in verses 9-11a. The disciples are the
          Father's, and continue so even when 'given' to Christ, in accordance
          with the community of possession, which oneness of nature and
          perfectness of love establish between the Father and the Son. God
          cannot but care for those who are His. The Son cannot but pray for
          those who are His. Their having recognised Him for what He was binds
          Him to pray for them. He is glorified in disciples, and if we show
          forth His character, He will be our Advocate. The last reason for His
          prayer is the loneliness of the disciples and their exposure in the
          world without Him. His departure impelled Him to Intercede, both as
          being a leaving them defenceless and as being an entrance into the
          heavenly state of communion with the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the petition itself (v.11b), observe the invocation 'Holy Father!'
          with special reference to the prayer for preservation from the
          corruption of the world. God's holiness is the pledge that He will
          make us holy, since He is 'Father' as well. Observe the substance of
          the request, that the disciples should be kept, as in a fortress,
          within the enclosing circle of the name which God has given to Jesus.
          The name is the manifestation of the divine nature. It was given to
          Jesus, inasmuch as He, 'the Word,' had from the beginning the office
          of revealing God; and that which was spoken of the Angel of the
          Covenant is true in highest reality of Jesus: 'My name is in Him.'
          'The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it
          and is safe.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe the issue of this keeping; namely, the unity of believers. The
          depths of that saying are beyond us, but we can at least see thus far
          -- that the true bond of unity is the name in which all who are one
          are kept; that the pattern of the true unity of believers is the
          ineffable union of Father and Son, which is oneness of will and
          nature, along with distinctness of persons; and that therefore this
          purpose goes far deeper than outward unity of organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then follow other pleas, which are principally drawn from Christ's
          relation to the disciples, now ending; whereas the former ones were
          chiefly deduced from the disciples' relation to Him. He can no more do
          what He has done, and commits it to the Father. Happy we if we can
          leave our unfinished tasks to be taken up by God, and trust those whom
          we leave undefended to be shielded by Him! 'I kept' is, in the Greek,
          expressive of continuous, repeated action, while 'I guarded' gives the
          single issue of the many acts of keeping. Jesus keeps His disciples
          now as He did then, by sedulous, patient, reiterated acts, so that
          they are safe from evil. But note where He kept them -- 'in Thy name.'
          That is our place of safety, a sure defence and inexpugnable fortress.
          One, indeed, was lost; but that was not any slur on Christ's keeping,
          but resulted from his own evil nature, as being 'a son of loss' (if we
          may so preserve the affinity of the words in the Greek), and from the
          divine decree from of old. Sharply defined and closely united are the
          two apparent contradictories of man's free choice of destruction and
          God's foreknowledge. Christ saw them in harmony, and we shall do so
          one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the flow of the prayer recurs to former thoughts. Going away so
          soon, He yearned to leave them sharers of His own emotions in the
          prospect of His departure to the Father, and therefore He had admitted
          them (and us) to hear this sacred outpouring of His desires. If we
          laid to heart the blessed revelations of this disclosure of Christ's
          heart, and followed Him with faithful gaze as He ascends to the
          Father, and realised our share in that triumph, our empty vessels
          would be filled by some of that same joy which was His. Earthly joy
          can never be full; Christian joy should never be anything less than
          full.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then follows a final glance at the disciples' relation to the world,
          to which they are alien because they are of kindred to Him. This is
          the ground for the repetition of the prayer 'keep', with the
          difference that formerly it was 'keep <i>in</i> Thy name,' and now it
          is '<i>from</i> the evil.' It is good to gaze first on our defence,
          the 'munitions of rocks' where we lie safely, and then we can venture
          to face the thought of 'the evil,' from which that keeps us, whether
          it be personal or abstract.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Verses 16-19 give the final petition for the immediate circle of
          disciples, with its grounds. The position of alienation from the
          world, in which the disciples stand by reason of their assimilation to
          Jesus, is repeated here. It was the reason for the former prayer,
          'keep'; it is the reason for the new petition, 'sanctify.' Keeping
          comes first, and then sanctifying, or consecration. Security from evil
          is given that we may be wholly devoted to the service of God. The evil
          in the world is the great hindrance to that. The likeness to Jesus is
          the great ground of hope that we shall be truly consecrated. We are
          kept 'in the name'; we are consecrated 'in the truth,' which is the
          revelation made by Jesus, and in a very deep sense is Himself. That
          truth is, as it were, the element in which the believer lives, and by
          abiding in which his real consecration is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's prayer for us should be our aim and deepest desire for
          ourselves, and His declaration of the condition of its fulfilment
          should prescribe our firm adhesion to, and constant abiding in, the
          truth as revealed and embodied in Him, as the only means by which we
          can attain the consecration which is at once, as the closing verses of
          the passage tell us, the means by which we may fulfil the purpose for
          which we are sent into the world, and the path on which we reach
          complete assimilation to His perfect self-surrender. All Christians
          are sent into the world by Jesus, as Jesus was sent by the Father. We
          have the charge to glorify Him. We have the presence of the Sender
          with us, the sent. We are inspired with His Spirit. We cannot do His
          work without that entire consecration which shall copy His devotion to
          the Father and eager swiftness to do His will. How can such ennobling
          and exalted consecration be ours? There is but one way. He has
          'consecrated Himself,' and by union with Him through faith, our
          selfishness may be subdued, and the Spirit of Christ may dwell in our
          hearts, to make us 'living sacrifices, consecrated and acceptable to
          God.' Then shall we be truly 'consecrated,' and then only, when we can
          say, 'I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' That is the end of
          Christ's consecration of Himself -- the prayer which He prayed for His
          disciples -- and should be the aim which every disciple earnestly
          pursues.
