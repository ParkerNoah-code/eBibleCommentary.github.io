          'I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in
          Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that
          beareth fruit He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now
          ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in
          Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it
          abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.' -- JOHN
          xv.14.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHAT suggested this lovely parable of the vine and the branches is
          equally unimportant and undiscoverable. Many guesses have been made,
          and, no doubt, as was the case with almost all our Lord's parables,
          some external object gave occasion for it. It is a significant token
          of our Lord's calm collectedness, even at that supreme and heart-
          shaking moment, that He should have been at leisure to observe, and to
          use for His purposes of teaching, something that was present at the
          instant. The deep and solemn lessons which He draws, perhaps from some
          vine by the wayside, are the richest and sweetest clusters that the
          vine has ever grown. The great truth in this chapter, applied in
          manifold directions, and viewed in many aspects, is that of the living
          union between Christ and those who believe on Him, and the parable of
          the vine and the branches affords the foundation for all which
          follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take the first half of that parable now. It is somewhat difficult
          to trace the course of thought in it, but there seems to be, first of
          all, the similitude set forth, without explanation or interpretation,
          in its most general terms, and then various aspects in which its
          applications to Christian duty are taken up and reiterated, I simply
          follow the words which I have read for my text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We have then, first, the Vine in the vital unity of all its parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I am the True Vine,' of which the material one to which He perhaps
          points, is but a shadow and an emblem. The reality lies in Him. We
          shall best understand the deep significance and beauty of this thought
          if we recur in imagination to some of those great vines which we
          sometimes see in royal conservatories, where for hundred of yards the
          pliant branches stretch along the espaliers, and yet one life pervades
          the whole, from the root, through the crooked stem, right away to the
          last leaf at the top of the farthest branch, and reddens and mellows
          every cluster, 'So,' says Christ, 'between Me and the totality of them
          that hold by Me in faith there is one life, passing ever from root
          through branches, and ever bearing fruit.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you that this great thought of the unity of life between
          Jesus Christ and all that believe upon Him is the familiar teaching of
          Scripture, and is set forth by other emblems besides that of the vine,
          the queen of the vegetable world; for we have it in the metaphor of
          the body and its members, where not only are the many members declared
          to be parts of one body, but the name of the collective body, made up
          of many members, is Christ. 'So also is' -- not as we might expect,
          'the Church,' but -- 'Christ,' the whole bearing the name of Him who
          is the Source of life to every part. Personality remains,
          individuality remains: I am I, and He is He, and thou art thou; but
          across the awful gulf of individual consciousness which parts us from
          one another, Jesus Christ assumes the Divine prerogative of passing
          and joining Himself to each of us, if we love Him and trust Him, in a
          union so close, and with a communication of life so real, that every
          other union which we know is but a faint and far-off adumbration of
          it. A oneness of life from root to branch, which is the sole cause of
          fruitfulness and growth, is taught us here.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then let me remind you that that living unity between Jesus Christ
          and all who love Him is a oneness which necessarily results in oneness
          of relation to God and men, in oneness of character, and in oneness of
          destiny. In relation to God, He is the Son, and we in Him receive the
          standing of sons. He has access ever into the Father's presence, and
          we through Him and in Him have access with confidence and are accepted
          in the Beloved. In relation to men, since He is Light, we, touched
          with His light, are also, in our measure and degree, the lights of the
          world; and in the proportion in which we receive into our souls, by
          patient abiding in Jesus Christ, the very power of His Spirit, we,
          too, become God's anointed, subordinately but truly His messiahs, for
          He Himself says: 'As the Father hath sent Me, even so I send you.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to character, the living union between Christ and His
          members results in a similarity if not identity of character, and with
          His righteousness we are clothed, and by that righteousness we are
          justified, and by that righteousness we are sanctified. The oneness
          between Christ and His children is the ground at once of their
          forgiveness and acceptance, and of all virtue and nobleness of life
          and conduct that can ever be theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, in like manner, we can look forward and be sure that we are so
          closely joined with Him, if we love Him and trust Him, that it is
          impossible but that where He is there shall also His servants be; and
          that what He is that shall also His servants be. For the oneness of
          life, by which we are delivered from the bondage of corruption and the
          law of sin and death here, will never halt nor cease until it brings
          us into the unity of His glory, 'the measure of the stature of the
          fullness of Christ.' And as He sits on the Father's throne, His
          children must needs sit with Him, on His throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the name of the collective whole, of which the individual
          Christian is part, is Christ. And as in the great Old Testament
          prophecy of the Servant of the Lord, the figure that rises before
          Isaiah's vision fluctuates between that which is clearly the
          collective Israel and that which is, as clearly, the personal Messiah;
          so the 'Christ' is not only the individual Redeemer who bears the body
          of the flesh literally here upon earth, but the whole of that redeemed
          Church, of which it is said, 'It is His body, the fullness of Him that
          filleth all in all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now note, secondly, the Husbandman, and the dressing of the vine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one tool that a vinedresser needs is a knife. The chief secret of
          culture is merciless pruning. And so says my text, 'The Father is the
          Husbandman.' Our Lord assumes that office in other of His parables.
          But here the exigencies of the parabolic form require that the office
          of Cultivator should be assigned only to the Father; although we are
          not to forget that the Father, in that office, works through and in
          His Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we should note that the one kind of husbandry spoken of here is
          pruning -- not manuring, not digging, but simply the hacking away of
          all that is rank and all that is dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Were you ever in a greenhouse or in a vineyard at the season of
          cutting back the vines? What flagitious waste it would seem to an
          ignorant person to see scattered on the floor the bright green leaves
          and the incipient clusters, and to look up at the bare stem, bleeding
          at a hundred points from the sharp steel. Yes! But there was not a
          random stroke in it all, and there was nothing cut away which it was
          not loss to keep and gain to lose; and it was all done artistically,
          scientifically, for a set purpose -- that the plant might bring forth
          more fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, says Christ, the main thing that is needed -- not, indeed, to
          improve the life in the branches, but to improve the branches in which
          the life is -- is excision. There are two forms of it given here --
          absolutely dead wood has to be cut out; wood that has life in it, but
          which has also rank shoots, that do not come from the all- pervading
          and hallowed life, has to be pruned back and deprived of its shoots.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to me that the very language of the metaphor before us
          requires us to interpret the fruitless branches as meaning all those
          who have a mere superficial, external adherence to the True Vine. For,
          according to the whole teaching of the parable, if there be any real
          union, there will be some life, and if there be any life, there will
          be some fruit, and, therefore, the branch that has no fruit has no
          life, because it has no real union. And so the application, as I take
          it, is necessarily to those professing Christians, nominal adherents
          to Christianity or to Christ's Church, people that come to church and
          chapel, and if you ask them to put down in the census paper what they
          are, will say that they are Christians -- Churchmen or Dissenters, as
          the case may be -- but who have no real hold upon Jesus Christ, and no
          real reception of anything from Him; and the 'taking away' is simply
          that, somehow or other, God makes visible, what is a fact, that they
          do not belong to Him with whom they have this nominal connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The longer Christianity continues in any country, the more does the
          Church get weighted and lowered in its temperature by the aggregation
          round about it of people of that sort. And one sometimes longs and
          prays for a storm to come, of some sort or other, to blow the dead
          wood out of the tree, and to get rid of all this oppressive and
          stifling weight of sham Christians that has come round every one of
          our churches. 'His fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His
          floor,' and every man that has any reality of Christian life in him
          should pray that this pruning and cutting out of the dead wood may be
          done, and that He would 'come as a refiner's fire and purify' His
          priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is the other side, the pruning of the fruitful branches. We
          all, in our Christian life, carry with us the two natures -- our own
          poor miserable selves, and the better life of Jesus Christ within us.
          The one flourishes at the expense of the other; and it is the
          Husbandman's merciful, though painful work, to cut back unsparingly
          the rank shoots that come from self, in order that all the force of
          our lives may be flung into the growing of the cluster which is
          acceptable to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear friends, let us understand the meaning of all that comes to
          us. The knife is sharp and the tendrils bleed, and things that seem
          very beautiful and very precious are unsparingly shorn away, and we
          are left bare, and, as it seems to ourselves, impoverished. But Oh! it
          is all sent that we may fling our force into the production of fruit
          unto God. And no stroke will be a stroke too many or too deep if it
          helps us to that. Only let us take care that we do not let regrets for
          the vanished good harm us just as much as joy in the present good did,
          and let us rather, in humble submission of will to His merciful knife,
          say to Him, 'Cut to the quick, Lord, if only thereby my fruit unto
          Thee may increase.'
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, we have here the branches abiding in the Vine, and
          therefore fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord deals with the little group of His disciples as incipiently
          and imperfectly, but really, cleansed through 'the word which He has
          spoken to them,' and gives them His exhortation towards that conduct
          through which the cleansing and the union and the fruitfulness will
          all be secured. 'Now ye are clean: abide in Me and I in you. As the
          branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no
          more can ye except ye abide in Me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Union with Christ is the condition of all fruitfulness. There may be
          plenty of activity and yet barrenness. Works are not fruit. We can
          bring forth a great deal 'of ourselves,' and because it is of
          ourselves it is nought. Fruit is possible only on condition of union
          with Him. He is the productive source of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the great glory and distinctive blessedness of the Gospel.
          Other teachers come to us and tell us how we ought to live, and give
          us laws, patterns and examples, reasons and motives for pure and noble
          lives. The Gospel comes and gives us life, if we will take it, and
          unfolds itself in us into all the virtues that we have to possess.
          What is the use of giving a man a copy if he cannot copy it? Morality
          comes and stands over the cripple, and says to him, 'Look here! This
          is how you ought to walk,' and he lies there, paralysed and crippled,
          after as before the exhibition of what graceful progression is. But
          Christianity comes and bends over him, and lays hold of his hand, and
          says, 'In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk,' and
          his feet and ankle bones receive strength, and 'he leaps, and walks,
          and praises God.' Christ gives more than commandments, patterns,
          motives; He gives the power to live soberly, righteously, and godly,
          and in Him alone is that power to be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then note that our reception of that power depends upon our own
          efforts. 'Abide in Me and I in you.' Is that last clause a commandment
          as well as the first? How can His abiding in us be a duty incumbent
          upon us? But it is. And we might paraphrase the intention of this
          imperative in its two halves, by -- Do you take care that you abide in
          Christ, and that Christ abides in you. The two ideas are but two sides
          of the one great sphere; they complement and do not contradict each
          other. We dwell in Him as the part does in the whole, as the branch
          does in the vine, recipient of its life and fruit- bearing energy. He
          dwells in us as the whole does in the part, as the vine dwells in the
          branch, communicating its energy to every part; or as the soul does in
          the body, being alive equally in every part, though it be sight in the
          eyeball, and hearing in the ear, and colour in the cheek, and strength
          in the hand, and swiftness in the foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Abide in Me and I in you.' So we come down to very plain, practical
          exhortations. Dear brethren, suppress yourselves, and empty your lives
          of self, that the life of Christ may come in. A lock upon a canal, if
          it is empty, will have its gates pressed open by the water in the
          canal and will be filled. Empty the heart and Christ will come in.
          'Abide in Him' by continual direction of thought, love, desire to Him;
          by continual and reiterated submission of the will to Him, as
          commanding and as appointing; by the honest reference to Him of daily
          life and all petty duties which otherwise distract us and draw us away
          from Him. Then, dwelling in Him we shall share in His life, and shall
          bring forth fruit to His praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is encouragement for us all. To all of us, sometimes, our lives
          seem barren and poor; and we feel as if we had brought forth no fruit
          to perfection. Let us get nearer to Him and He will see to the fruit.
          Some poor stranded sea-creature on the beach, vainly floundering in
          the pools, is at the point of death; but the great tide comes, leaping
          and rushing over the sands, and bears it away out into the middle
          deeps for renewed activity and joyous life. Let the flood of Christ's
          life bear you on its bosom, and you will rejoice and expatiate
          therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a lesson of solemn warning to professing Christians. The lofty
          mysticism and inward life in Jesus Christ all terminate at last in
          simple, practical obedience; and the fruit is the test of the life.
          'Depart from Me, I never knew you, ye that work iniquity.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And here is a lesson of solemn appeal to us all. Our only opportunity
          of bearing any fruit worthy of our natures and of God's purpose
          concerning us is by vital union with Jesus Christ. If we have not
          that, there may be plenty of activity and mountains of work in our
          lives, but there will be no fruit. Only that is fruit which pleases
          God and is conformed to His purpose concerning us, and all the rest of
          our busy doings is no more the fruit a man should bear than cankers
          are roses, or than oak-galls are acorns. They are but the work of a
          creeping grub, and diseased excrescences that suck into themselves the
          juices that should swell the fruit. Open your hearts to Christ and let
          His life and His Spirit come into you, and then you will have 'your
          fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.'
