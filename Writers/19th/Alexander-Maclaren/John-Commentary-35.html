        <p>'In the garden a new tomb.' -- JOHN xix.41 (R.V.).</p>
        <p>
          This is possibly no more than a topographical note introduced merely
          for the sake of accuracy. But it is quite in John's manner to attach
          importance to these apparent trifles and to give no express statement
          that he is doing so. There are several other instances in the Gospel
          where similar details are given which appear to have had in his eyes a
          symbolical meaning -- e.g. 'And it was night.' There may have been
          such a thought in his mind, for all men in high excitement love and
          seize symbols, and I can scarcely doubt that the reason which induced
          Joseph to make his grave in a garden was the reason which induced John
          to mention so particularly its situation, and that they both discerned
          in that garden round the sepulchre, the expression of what was to the
          one a dim desire, to the other 'a lively hope by the resurrection of
          Jesus Christ from the dead' -- that they who are laid to rest in the
          grave shall come forth again in new and fairer life, as 'the garden
          causeth the things that are sown in it to bud.'
        </p>
        <p>
          To us at all events on Easter morning, with nature rising on every
          hand from her winter death, and 'life re-orient out of dust,' that new
          sepulchre in the garden may well serve for the starting-point of the
          familiar but ever-precious lessons of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. A symbol of death and decay as interwoven with all nature and every
          joy.
        </p>
        <p>We think of Eden and the first coming of death.</p>
        <p>
          The grave was fittingly in the garden, because nature too is subject
          to the law of decay and death. The flowers fade and men die.
          Meditative souls have ever gathered lessons of mortality there, and
          invested death with an alien softness by likening it to falling leaves
          and withered blooms. But the contrast is greater than the resemblance,
          and painless dropping of petals is not a parallel to the rending of
          soul and body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The garden's careless wealth of beauty and joy continues unconcerned
          whatever befalls us. 'One generation cometh and another goeth, but the
          earth abideth for ever.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The grave is in the garden because all our joys and works have sooner
          or later death associated with them.
        </p>
        <p>Every relationship.</p>
        <p>Every occupation.</p>
        <p>Every joy.</p>
        <p>
          The grave in the garden bids us bring the wholesome contemplation of
          death into all life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be a harm and weakening to think of it, but should be a
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>II. The dim hopes with which men have fought against death.</p>
        <p>
          To lay the dead amid blooming nature and fair flowers has been and is
          natural to men. The symbolism is most natural, deep, and beautiful,
          expressing the possibility of life and even of advance in the life
          after apparent decay. There is something very pathetic in so eager a
          grasping after some stay for hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these natural symbols are insufficient. They are not proofs, they
          are only pretty analogies. But they are all that men have on which to
          build their hopes as to a future life apart from Christ. That future
          was vague, a region for hopes and wishes or fears, not for certainty,
          a region for poetic fancies. The thoughts of it were very faintly
          operative. Men asked, Shall we live again? Conscience seemed to
          answer, Yes! The instinct of immortality in men's souls grasped at
          these things as proofs of what it believed without them, but there was
          no clear light.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The clear light of certain hope which Christ's resurrection
          brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grave in the garden reversed Adam's bringing of death into Eden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's resurrection as a fact bears on the belief in a future state
          as nothing else can.
        </p>
        <p>
          It changes hope into certainty. It shows by actual example that death
          has nothing to do with the soul; that life is independent of the body;
          that a man after death is the same as before it. The risen Lord was
          the same in His relations to His disciples, the same in His love, in
          His memory, and in all else.
        </p>
        <p>
          It changes shadowy hopes of continuous life into a solid certainty of
          resurrection life. The former is vague and powerless. It is impossible
          to conceive of the future with vividness unless as a bodily life. And
          this is the strength of the Christian conception of the future life,
          that corporeity is the end and goal of the redeemed man.
        </p>
        <p>
          It changes terror and awe into joy, and opens up a future in which He
          is.
        </p>
        <p>We shall be with Him.</p>
        <p>We shall be like Him.</p>
        <p>
          Now we can go back to all these incomplete analogies and use them
          confidently. Our faith does not rest upon them but upon what has
          actually been done on this earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is 'the First fruits of them that slept.' What will the harvest
          be!
        </p>
        <p>
          As the single little seed is poor and small by the side of the
          gorgeous flower that comes from it; so will be the change. 'God giveth
          it a body as it hath pleased Him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          How then to think of death for ourselves and for those who are gone?
          Thankfully and hopefully.
