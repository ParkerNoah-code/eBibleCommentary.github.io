          'Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
          on Me through their word; That they all may be one; as Thou, Father,
          art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: that the
          world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou
          givest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
          I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
          that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them,
          as Thou hast loved Me. Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast
          given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory, which
          Thou hast given Me: for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the
          world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee: but I have
          known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent Me. And I have
          declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it; that the love
          wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them.' -- JOHN
          xvii.20-26.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remainder of this prayer reaches out to all generations of
          believers to the end. We may incidentally note that it shows that
          Jesus did not anticipate a speedy end of the history of the world or
          the Church; and also that it breathes but one desire, that for the
          Church's unity, as though He saw what would be its greatest peril.
          Characteristic, too, of the idealism of this Gospel is it that there
          is no name for that future community. It is not called 'church,' or
          'congregation,' or the like -- it is 'them also that believe on Me
          through their word,' a great spiritual community, held together by
          common faith in Him whom the Apostles preached. Is not that still the
          best definition of Christians, and does not such a conception of it
          correspond better to its true nature than the formal abstraction, 'the
          Church'?
        </p>
        <p>
          We can but touch in the most inadequate fashion the profound words of
          this section of the prayer which would take volumes to expound fitly.
          We note that it contains four periods, in each of which something is
          asked or stated, and then a purpose to be attained by the petition or
          statement is set forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          First comes the prayer for unity and what the answer to it will effect
          (v.21). Now in this verse the unity of believers is principally
          regarded as resulting from the inclusion, if we may so say, of them
          all in the ineffable union of the Father and the Son. Jesus prays that
          'they may all be one,' and also 'that they also may be in us' (Rev.
          Ver.). And their unity is no mere matter of formal external
          organisation nor of unanimity of creed, or the like, but it is a deep,
          vital unity. The pattern of it is the unity of the Father and the Son,
          and the power that brings it about is the abiding of all believers 'in
          us.' The result of such a manifestation in the world of a multitude of
          men, in all of whom one life evidently moves, fusing their
          individualities while retaining their personalities, will be the
          world's conviction of the divine mission of Jesus. The world was
          beginning to feel its convictions moving slowly in that direction,
          when it exclaimed: 'Behold how these Christians love one another!' The
          alienation of Christians has given barbs and feathers to its arrows of
          scorn. But it is 'the unity of the Spirit,' not that of a, great
          corporation, that Christ's prayer desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          The petitions for what would be given to believers passes for a moment
          into a statement of what Jesus had already given to them. He had begun
          the unifying gift, and that made a plea for its perfecting. The
          'glory' which He had given to these poor bewildered Galilaeans was but
          in a rudimentary stage; but still, wherever there is faith in Him,
          there is some communication of His life and Spirit, and some of that
          veiled and yet radiant glory, 'full of grace and truth,' which shone
          through the covering when the Incarnate Word 'became flesh.' It is the
          Christ-given Christ-likeness in each which knits believers into one.
          It is Christ in us and we in Christ that fuses us into one, and
          thereby makes each perfect. And such flashing back of the light of
          Jesus from a million separate crystals, all glowing with one light and
          made one in the light, would flash on darkest eyes the lustre of the
          conviction that God sent Christ, and that God's love enfolded those
          Christlike souls even as it enfolded Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again (v.24) comes a petition with its result. And here there is no
          mention of the effect of the answer on the world. For the moment the
          thoughts of isolation in, and a message to, the world fade away. The
          partially-possessed 'glory' seems to have led on Christ's thoughts to
          the calm home of perfection waiting for Him who was 'not of the world'
          and was sent into it, and for the humble ones who had taken Him for
          Lord. 'I will that' -- that is a strange tone for a prayer. What
          consciousness on Christ's part does it involve? The disciples are not
          now called 'them that should believe on Me,' but 'that which Thou hast
          given Me,' the individuals melt into the great whole. They are
          Christ's, not merely by their faith or man's preaching, but by the
          Father's gift. And the fact of that gift is used as a plea with Him,
          to 'perfect that which concerneth' them, and to complete the unity of
          believers with Jesus by bringing them to be 'with Him' in His
          triumphant session at the right hand. To 'behold' will be the same as
          to share His glory, not only that which we beheld when He tabernacled
          among us, but that which He had in the pouring out on Him of God's
          love 'before the foundation of the world.' Our dim eyes cannot follow
          the happy souls as they are lost in the blaze, but we know that they
          walk in light and are like Him, for they 'see Him as He is.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The last statement (vs.25, 26) is not petition but vow, and, to our
          ears, promise. The contrast of the world and believers appears for the
          last time. What made the world a 'world' was its not knowing God; what
          made believers isolated in, and having an errand to, the world, was
          that they 'knew' (not merely 'believed,' but knew by experience) that
          Jesus had been sent from God to make known His name. All our knowledge
          of God comes through Him; it is for us to recognise His divine
          mission, and then He will unveil, more and more, with blessed
          continuity of increasing knowledge, the Name, and with growing
          knowledge of it growing measures of God's love will be in us, and
          Jesus Himself will 'dwell in our hearts by faith' more completely and
          more blessedly through an eternity of wider knowledge and more fervent
          love.
