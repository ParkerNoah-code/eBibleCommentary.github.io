          '...They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray
          not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou
          shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as
          I am not of the world.' -- JOHN xvii.14-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have here a petition imbedded in a reiterated statement of the
          disciples' isolated position when left in a hostile world without
          Christ's sheltering presence. We cannot fathom the depth of the
          mystery of the <i>praying</i> Christ, but we may be sure of this, that
          His prayers were always in harmony with the Father's will, were, in
          fact, the expression of that will, and were therefore promises and
          prophecies. What He prays the Father for His disciples He gives to His
          disciples. Once only had He to say, 'If it be possible'; at all other
          times He prayed as sure that 'Thou hearest Me always,' and in this
          very prayer He speaks in a tone of strange authority, when He prays
          for all believers in future ages, and says: 'I will that, where I am,
          they also may be with Me.' In this High-priestly prayer, offered when
          Gethsemane was almost in sight, and the Judgment Hall and Calvary were
          near, our Lord's tender interest in His disciples fills His mind, and
          even in its earlier portion, which is in form a series of petitions
          for Himself, it is in essence a prayer for them, whilst this central
          section which concerns the Apostles, and the closing section which
          casts the mantle of His love and care over all who hereafter shall
          'believe on Me through their word,' witnesses to the sublime
          completeness of His self-oblivion. Gethsemane heard His prayer for
          Himself; here He prays for His people, and the calm serenity and
          confident assurance of this prayer, set against the agitation of that
          other, receives and gives emphasis by the contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text falls into two parts, the enclosing circle of the repeated
          statement of the disciples' isolation in an alien world, and the
          enclosed jewel of the all-sufficient prayer which guarantees their
          protection. We shall best make its comfort and cheer our own by
          dealing with these two successively.
        </p>
        <p>I. The disciples' isolation.</p>
        <p>
          Of course we are to interpret the 'world' here in accordance with the
          ethical usage of that term in this Gospel, according to which it means
          the aggregate of mankind considered as apart from and alien to God. It
          is roughly equivalent to the modern phrase, 'society.'
        </p>
        <p>
          With that order of things Christ's real followers are not in accord.
        </p>
        <p>That want of accord depends upon their accord with Jesus.</p>
        <p>
          Every Christian has the 'mind of Christ' in him, in the measure of his
          Christianity. 'It is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master'
          But Christian discipleship has a better guarantee for the assimilation
          of the disciple to his Lord than the ordinary forms of the relation of
          teacher and taught ever present. There is a participation in the
          Master's life, an implantation in the scholar's spirit of the
          Teacher's Spirit. 'Christ in us' is not only 'the hope of glory,' but
          the power which makes possible and actual the present possession of a
          life kindred with, because derived from, and essentially one with, His
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          They whose spirits are touched by the indwelling Christ to the 'fine
          issues' of sympathy with the law of His earthly life cannot but live
          in the world as aliens, and wander amid its pitfalls with 'blank
          misgivings' and a chill sense that this is not their rest. They are
          knit to One whose 'meat and drink' was to do the will of the Father in
          heaven, who 'pleased not Himself,' whose life was all one long service
          and sacrifice for men, whose joys were not fed by earthly possessions
          or delights. How should they have a sense of community of aims with
          grovelling hearts that cling to wealth or ambition, that are not at
          peace with God, and have no holdfasts beyond this 'bank and shoal of
          time'? A man who has drunk into the spirit of Christ's life is thereby
          necessarily thrown out of gear with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy is he if his union with Jesus is so deep and close that it is
          but deepened by his experience of the lack of sympathy between the
          world and himself! Happy if his consciousness of not being 'of the
          world' but quickens his desire to help the world and glorify his Lord,
          by bringing His all-sufficiency into its emptiness, and leading it,
          too, to discern His sweetness and beauty!
        </p>
        <p>
          But how little the life of the average Christian corresponds to this
          reiterated utterance of our Lord! Who of us dare venture to take it on
          our lips and to say that we are 'not of the world even as He is not of
          the world'? Is not our relation to that world of which Jesus here
          speaks a contrast rather than a parallel to His? The 'prince of this
          world' had nothing in Christ, as He himself declared, but He has much
          in each of us. There are stored up heaps of combustibles in every one
          of us which catch fire only too swiftly, and burn but too fiercely,
          when the 'fiery darts of the wicked' fall among them. Instead of an
          instinctive recoil from the view of life characteristic of 'the
          world,' we must confess, if we are honest, that it draws us strongly,
          and many of us are quite at home with it. Why is this but because we
          do not habitually live near enough to our Lord to drink in His Spirit?
          The measure of our discord with the world is the measure of our accord
          with our Saviour. It is in the degree in which we possess His life
          that we come to be aliens here, and it is in the degree in which we
          keep in touch with Jesus, and keep our hearts wide open for the
          entrance of His Spirit, that we possess His life. A worldly Christian
          -- no uncommon character -- is a Christian who has all but shut
          himself off from the life which Christ breathes into the expectant
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>II. The disciples' guarded security.</p>
        <p>
          Jesus encloses His prayer between the two parts of that repeated
          statement of the disciples' isolation. It is like some lovely,
          peaceful plain circled by grim mountains. The isolation is a necessary
          consequence of the disciples' previous union with Him. It involves
          much that is painful to the unrenewed part of their natures, but their
          Lord's prayer is more than enough for their security and peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world.' They are
          in it by God's appointment for great purposes, affecting their own
          characters and affecting the world, with which Christ will not
          interfere. It is their training ground, their school. The sense of
          belonging to another order is to be intensified by their experiences
          in it, and these are to make more vivid the hopes that yearn towards
          the true home, and to develop the 'wrestling thews that throw the
          world.' The discipline of life is too precious to be tampered with
          even by a Saviour's prayer, and He loves His people too wisely to seek
          to shelter them from its roughness, and to procure for them exemption
          which would impoverish their characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let us learn the lesson and shape our desires after the pattern of
          our Lord's prayer for us, nor blindly seek for that ease which He
          would not ask for us. False asceticism that shrinks from contact with
          an alien world, weak running from trials and temptations, selfish
          desires for exemption from sorrows, are all rebuked by this prayer.
          Christ's relation to the world is our pattern, and we are not to seek
          for pillows in an order of things where He 'had not where to lay His
          head.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But He does ask for His people that they may be kept 'from evil,' or
          from 'the evil One.' That prayer is, as we have said, a promise and a
          prophecy. But the fulfilment of it in each individual disciple hinges
          on the disciple's keeping himself in touch with Jesus, whereby the
          'much virtue' of His prayer will encompass him and keep him safe. We
          do not discuss the alternative renderings, according to one of which
          'the evil' is impersonal, and according to the other of which it is
          concentrated in the personal 'prince of this world.' In either case,
          it is 'the evil' against which the disciples are to be guarded,
          whether it has a personal source or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, in Christ's intercession, is the firm ground of our confidence
          that we may be 'more than conquerors' in the life-long fight which we
          have to wage. The sweet strong old psalm is valid in its assurances
          to-day for every soul which puts itself under the shadow of Christ's
          protecting intercession: 'The Lord shall keep thee from all evil, He
          shall keep thy soul.' We have not 'to lift up our eyes unto the
          hills,' for 'vainly is help hoped for from the multitude of the
          mountains,' but 'Our help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and
          earth.' Therefore we may dwell at peace in the midst of an alien
          world, having the Father for our Keeper, and the Son, who overcame the
          world, for our Intercessor, our Pattern and our Hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parallel between Christ and His people applies to their relations
          to the present order of things: 'They are not of the world, even as I
          am not of the world.' It applies to their mission here: 'As Thou didst
          send Me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.' It
          applies to the future: 'I am no more in the world, but these are in
          the world, and I come to Thee,' and in that 'coming' lies the
          guarantee that His servants will, each in his due time, come out from
          this alien world and pass into the state which is home, because He is
          there. The prayer that they might be kept from the evil, while
          remaining in the scene where evil is rampant, is crowned by the
          prayer: 'I will that, where I am, they also may be with Me, that they
          may behold My glory.'
