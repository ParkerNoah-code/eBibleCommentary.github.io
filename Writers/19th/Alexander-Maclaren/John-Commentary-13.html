          'A little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little while,
          and ye shall see Me, because I go to the Father. Then said some of His
          disciples among themselves, What is this that He saith unto us, A
          little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and
          ye shall see Me: and, Because I go to the Father? They said therefore,
          What is this that He saith, A little while? we cannot tell what He
          saith. Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask Him, and said
          unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little
          while, and ye shall not see Me: and again a little while, and ye shall
          see Me?' -- JOHN xvi.16-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          A superficial glance at the former part of these verses may fail to
          detect their connection with the great preceding promise of the Spirit
          who is to guide the disciples 'into all truth.' They appear to stand
          quite isolated and apart from that. But a little thought will bring
          out an obvious connection. The first words of our text are really the
          climax and crown of the promise of the Spirit; for that Spirit is to
          'guide into all the truth' by declaring to the disciples the things
          that are Christ's, and in consequence of that ministration, they are
          to be able to see their unseen Lord. So this is the loftiest thought
          of what the divine Spirit does for the Christian heart, that it shows
          Him a visible though absent Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have in the subsequent part of our text the blundering of the
          bewildered disciples and the patient answer of the long-suffering
          Teacher. So that there are these three points to take up: the times of
          disappearance and of sight; the bewildered disciples; and the patient
          Teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all, then, note the deep teaching of our Lord here, about
          the times of disappearance and of Sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words are plain enough; the difficulty lies in the determination
          of the periods to which they refer. He tells us that, after a brief
          interval from the time at which He was speaking, there would come a
          short parenthesis during which He was not to be seen; and that upon
          that would follow a period of which no end is hinted at, during which
          He is to be seen. The two words employed in the two consecutive
          clauses, for 'sight,' are not the same, and so they naturally suggest
          some difference in the manner of vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the question arises, Where are the limits of these times of which
          the Lord speaks? Now it is quite clear, I suppose, that the first of
          the 'little whiles' is the few hours that intervened between His
          speaking and the Cross. And it is equally clear that His death and
          burial began, at all events, the period during which they were not to
          see Him. But where does the second period begin, during which they are
          to see Him? Is it at His resurrection or at His ascension, when the
          process of 'going to the Father' was completed in all its stages; or
          at Pentecost, when the Spirit, by whose ministration He was to be made
          visible, was poured out? The answer is, perhaps, not to be restricted
          to any one of these periods; but I think if we consider that all
          disciples, in all ages, have a portion in all the rest of these great
          discourses, and if we note the absence of any hint that the promised
          seeing of Christ was ever to terminate, and if we mark the diversity
          of words under which the two manners of vision are described, and,
          above all, if we note the close connection of these words with those
          which precede, we shall come to the conclusion that the full
          realisation of this great promise of a visible Christ did not begin
          until that time when the Spirit, poured out, opened the eyes of His
          servants, and 'they saw His glory.' But however we settle the minor
          question of the chronology of these periods, the great truth shines
          out here that, through all the stretch of the ages, true hearts may
          truly see the true Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we might venture to suppose that in our text the second of the
          periods to which He refers, when they did not see Him, was not
          coterminous with, but preceded, the second 'little while,' all would
          be clear. Then the first 'little while' would be the few hours before
          the Cross. 'Ye shall not see Me' would refer to the days in which He
          lay in the tomb. 'Again, a little while' would point to that strange
          transitional period between His death and His ascension, in which the
          disciples had neither the close intercourse of earlier days nor the
          spiritual communion of later ones. And the final period, 'Ye shall see
          Me,' would cover the whole course of the centuries till He comes
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          However that may be, and I only offer it as a possible suggestion, the
          thing that we want to fasten upon for ourselves is this -- we all, if
          we will, may have a vision of Christ as close, as real, as firmly
          certifying us of His reality, and making as vivid an impression upon
          us, as if He stood there, visible to our senses. And so, 'by this
          vision splendid' we may 'be everywhere attended,' and whithersoever we
          go, have burning before us the light of His countenance, in the
          sunshine of which we shall walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brother! that is personal Christianity -- to see Jesus Christ, and to
          live with the thrilling consciousness, printed deep and abiding upon
          our spirits, that, in very deed, He is by our sides. O how that
          conviction would make life strong and calm and noble and blessed! How
          it would lift us up above temptation! 'He endured as seeing Him who is
          Invisible.' What should terrify us if Christ stood before us? What
          should charm us if we saw Him? Competing glories and attractions would
          fade before His presence, as a dim candle dies at noon. It would make
          all life full of a blessed companionship. Who could be solitary if he
          saw Christ? or feel that life was dreary if that Friend was by his
          side? It would fill our hearts with joy and strength, and make us
          evermore blessed by the light of His countenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how are we to get that vision? Remember the connection of my text.
          It is because there is a divine Spirit to show men the things that are
          Christ's that therefore, unseen, He is visible to the eye of faith.
          And therefore the shortest and directest road to the vision of Jesus
          is the submitting of heart and mind and spirit to the teaching of that
          divine Spirit, who uses the record of the Scriptures as the means by
          which He makes Jesus Christ known to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But besides this waiting upon that divine Teacher, let me remind you
          that there are conditions of discipline which must be fulfilled upon
          our parts, if any clear vision of Jesus Christ is to bless us pilgrims
          in this lonely world. And the first of these conditions is -- If you
          want to see Jesus Christ, think about Him. Occupy your minds with Him.
          If men in the city walk the pavements with their eyes fixed upon the
          gutters, what does it matter though all the glories of a sunset are
          dyeing the western sky? They will see none of them; and if Christ
          stood beside you, closer to you than any other, if your eyes were
          fixed upon the trivialities of this poor present, you would not see
          Him. If you honestly want to see Christ, meditate upon Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you want to see Him, shut out competing objects, and the
          dazzling cross-lights that come in and hide Him from us. There must be
          a 'looking <i>off</i> unto Jesus.' There must be a rigid limitation,
          if not excision, of other objects, if we are to grasp Him. If we would
          see, and have our hearts filled with, the calm sublimity of the
          solemn, white wedge that lifts itself into the far-off blue, we must
          not let our gaze stop on the busy life of the valleys or the green
          slopes of the lower Alps, but must lift it and keep it fixed aloft.
          Meditate upon Him, and shut out other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to see Christ, do His will. One act of obedience has more
          power to clear a man's eyes than hours of idle contemplation; and one
          act of disobedience has more power to dim his eyes than anything
          besides. It is in the dusty common road that He draws near to us, and
          the experience of those disciples that journeyed to Emmaus may be
          ours. He meets us in the way, and makes 'our hearts burn within us.'
          The experience of the dying martyr outside the city gate may be ours.
          Sorrows and trials will rend the heavens if they be rightly borne, and
          so we shall see Christ 'standing at the right hand of God.' Rebellious
          tears blind our eyes, as Mary's did, so that she did not know the
          Master and took Him for 'the gardener.' Submissive tears purge the
          eyes and wash them clean to see His face. To do His will is the
          sovereign method for beholding His countenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, is this our experience? You professing Christians, do you
          see Christ? Are your eyes fixed upon Him? Do you go through life with
          Him consciously nearer to you than any beside? Is He closer than the
          intrusive insignificances of this fleeting present? Have you Him as
          your continual Companion? Oh! when we contrast the difference between
          the largeness of this promise -- a promise of a thrilling
          consciousness of His presence, of a vivid perception of His character,
          of an unwavering certitude of His reality -- and the fly-away glimpses
          and wandering sight, and faint, far-off views, as of a planet
          weltering amid clouds, which the most of Christian men have of Christ,
          what shame should cover our faces, and how we should feel that if we
          have not the fulfilment, it is our own fault! Blessed they of whom it
          is true that they see 'no man any more save Jesus only'! and to whom
          all sorrow, joy, care, anxiety, work, and repose are but the means of
          revealing that sweet and all-sufficient Presence! 'I have set the Lord
          always before me, therefore I shall not be moved.'
        </p>
        <p>II. Now notice, secondly, these bewildered disciples.</p>
        <p>
          We find, in the early portion of these discourses, that twice they
          ventured to interrupt our Lord with more or less relevant questions,
          but as the wonderful words flowed on, they seem to have been awed into
          silence; and our Lord Himself almost complains of them that 'None of
          you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou?' The inexhaustible truths that He
          had spoken seem to have gone clear over their heads, but the verbal
          repetition of the 'little whiles,' and the recurring ring of the
          sentences, seem to have struck upon their ears. So passing by all the
          great words, they fasten upon this minor thing, and whisper among
          themselves, perhaps lagging behind on the road, as to what He means by
          these 'little whiles.' The Revised Version is probably correct, or at
          least it has strong manuscript authority in its favour, in omitting
          the clause in our Lord's words, 'Because I go to the Father.' The
          disciples seem to have quoted, not from the preceding verse, but from
          a verse a little before that in the context, where He said that 'the
          Spirit will convince the world of righteousness because I go to My
          Father, and ye see Me no more.' The contradiction seems to strike
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          These disciples in their bewilderment seem to me to represent some
          very common faults which we all commit in our dealing with the Lord's
          words, and to one or two of these I turn for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note this to begin with, how they pass by the greater truths in order
          to fasten upon a smaller outstanding difficulty. They have no
          questions to ask about the gifts of the Spirit, nor about the unity of
          Christ and His disciples as represented in the vine and the branches,
          nor about what He tells them of the love that 'lays down its life for
          its friends.' But when He comes into the region of chronology, they
          are all agog to know the 'when' about which He is so enigmatically
          speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now is not that exactly like us, and does not the Christianity of this
          day very much want the hint to pay most attention to the greatest
          truths, and let the little difficulties fall into their subordinate
          place? The central truths of Christianity are the incarnation and
          atonement of Jesus Christ. And yet outside questions, altogether
          subordinate and, in comparison with this, unimportant, are filling the
          attention and the thoughts of people at present to such an extent that
          there is great danger of the central truth of all being either passed
          by, or the reception of it being suspended on the clearing up of
          smaller questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth that Christ is the Son of God, who has died for our
          salvation, is the heart of the Gospel. And why should we make our
          faith in that, and our living by it, contingent on the clearing up of
          certain external and secondary questions; chronological, historical,
          critical, philological, scientific, and the like? And why should men
          be so occupied in jangling about the latter as that the towering
          supremacy, the absolute independence, of the former should be lost
          sight of? What would you think of a man in a fire who, when they
          brought the fire-escape to him, said, 'I decline to trust myself to
          it, until you first of all explain to me the principles of its
          construction; and, secondly, tell me all about who made it; and,
          thirdly, inform me where all the materials of which it is made came
          from?' But that is very much what a number of people are doing to-day
          in reference to 'the Gospel of our salvation,' when they demand that
          the small questions -- on which the central verity does not at all
          depend -- shall be answered and settled before they cast themselves
          upon that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another of the blunders of these disciples, in which they show
          themselves as our brethren, is that they fling up the attempt to
          apprehend the obscurity in a very swift despair. 'We cannot tell what
          He saith, and we are not going to try any more. It is all cloud-land
          and chaos together.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Intellectual indolence, spiritual carelessness, deal thus with
          outstanding difficulties, abandoning precipitately the attempt to
          grasp them or that which lies behind them. And yet although there are
          no gratuitous obscurities in Christ's teaching, He said a great many
          things which could not possibly be understood at the time, in order
          that the disciples might stretch up towards what was above them, and,
          by stretching up, might grow. I do not think that it is good to break
          down the children's bread too small. A wise teacher will now and then
          blend with the utmost simplicity something that is just a little in
          advance of the capacity of the listener, and so encourage a little
          hand to stretch itself out, and the arm to grow because it is
          stretched. If there are no difficulties there is no effort, and if
          there is no effort there is no growth. Difficulties are there in order
          that we may grapple with them, and truth is sometimes hidden in a well
          in order that we may have the blessing of the search, and that the
          truth found after the search may be more precious. The tropics, with
          their easy, luxuriant growth, where the footfall turns up the warm
          soil, grow languid men, and our less smiling latitude grows strenuous
          ones. Thank God that everything is not easy, even in that which is
          meant for the revelation of all truth to all men! Instead of turning
          tail at the first fence, let us learn that it will do us good to
          climb, and that the fence is there in order to draw forth our effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another point in which these bewildered disciples are
          uncommonly like the rest of us; and that is that they have no patience
          to wait for time and growth to solve the difficulty. They want to know
          all about it now, or not at all. If they would wait for six weeks they
          would understand, as they did. Pentecost explained it all. We, too,
          are often in a hurry. There is nothing that the ordinary mind, and
          often the educated mind, detests so much as uncertainty, and being
          consciously baffled by some outstanding difficulty. And in order to
          escape that uneasiness, men are dogmatical when they should be
          doubtful, and positively asserting when it would be a great deal more
          for the health of their souls and of their listeners to say, 'Well,
          really I do not know, and I am content to wait.' So, on both sides of
          great controversies, you get men who will not be content to let things
          wait, for all must be made clear and plain to-day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, brethren! for ourselves, for our own intellectual difficulties,
          and for the difficulties of the world, there is nothing like time and
          patience. The mysteries that used to plague us when we were boys
          melted away when we grew up. And many questions which trouble me to-
          day, and through which I cannot find my way, if I lay them aside, and
          go about my ordinary duties, and come back to them to-morrow with a
          fresh eye and an unwearied brain, will have straightened themselves
          out and become clear. We grow into our best and deepest convictions,
          we are not dragged into them by any force of logic. So for our own
          sorrows, questions, pains, griefs, and for all the riddle of this
          painful world,
        </p>
        <p>
          'Take it on trust a little while,<br />Thou soon shalt read the
          mystery right,<br />In the full sunshine of His smile.'
        </p>
        <p>III. Lastly, and very briefly, a word about the patient Teacher.</p>
        <p>
          'Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask Him.' He knows all our
          difficulties and perplexities. Perhaps it is His supernatural
          knowledge that is indicated in the words before us, or perhaps it is
          merely that He saw them whispering amongst themselves and so inferred
          their wish. Be that as it may, we may take the comfort that we have to
          do with a Teacher who accurately understands how much we understand
          and where we grope, and will shape His teaching according to our
          necessities.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had not a word of rebuke for the slowness of their apprehension. He
          might well have said to them, 'O fools and slow of heart to believe!'
          But that word was not addressed to them then, though two of them
          deserved it and got it, after events had thrown light on His teaching.
          He never rebukes us for either our stupidity or for our carelessness,
          but 'has long patience' with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does give them a kind of rebuke. 'Do ye inquire
          <i>among yourselves</i>?' That is a hopeful source to go to for
          knowledge. Why did they not ask Him, instead of whispering and
          muttering there behind Him, as if two people equally ignorant could
          help each other to knowledge? Inquiry 'among yourselves' is folly; to
          ask Him is wisdom. We can do much for one another, but the deepest
          riddles and mysteries can only be wisely dealt with in one way. Take
          them to Him, tell Him about them. Told to Him, they often dwindle.
          They become smaller when they are looked at beside Him, and He will
          help us to understand as much as may be understood, and patiently to
          wait and leave the residue unsolved, until the time shall come when
          'we shall know even as we are known.'

          In the context here, Jesus Christ does not explain to the disciples
          the precise point that troubled them. Olivet and Pentecost were to do
          that; but He gives them what will tide them over the time until the
          explanation shall come, in triumphant hopes of a joy and peace that
          are drawing near.

          And so there is a great deal in all our lives, in His dealings with
          us, in His revelation of Himself to us, that must remain mysterious
          and unintelligible. But if we will keep close to Him, and speak
          plainly to Him in prayer and communion about our difficulties, He will
          send us triumphant hope and large confidence of a coming joy, that
          will float us over the bar and make us feel that the burden is no
          longer painful to carry. Much that must remain dark through life will
          be lightened when we get yonder; for the vision here is not perfect,
          and the knowledge here is as imperfect as the vision.

          Dear friends! the one question for us all is, Do our eyes fix and
          fasten on that dear Lord, and is it the description of our own whole
          lives, that we see Him and walk with Him? Oh! if so, then life will be
          blessed, and death itself will be but as 'a little while' when we
          'shall not see Him,' and then we shall open our eyes and behold Him
          close at hand, whom we saw from afar, and with wandering eyes, amidst
          the mists and illusions of earth. To see Him as He became for our
          sakes is heaven on earth. To see Him as He is will be the heaven of
          heaven, and before that Face, 'as the sun shining in His strength,'
          all sorrows, difficulties, and mysteries will melt as morning mists.
