          'His disciples said unto Jesus, Lo! now speakest Thou plainly, and
          speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that Thou knowest all things, and
          needest not that any man should ask Thee: by this we believe that Thou
          earnest forth from God. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
          Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered,
          every man to his own, and shall leave Me alone: and yet I am not
          alone, because the Father is with Me.' -- JOHN xvi.29-32.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first words of these wonderful discourses were, 'Let not your
          heart be troubled.' They struck the key-note of the whole. The aim of
          all was to bring peace and confidence unto the disciples' spirits. And
          this joyful burst of confession which wells up so spontaneously and
          irrepressibly from their hearts, shows that the aim has been reached.
          For a moment sorrow, bewilderment, dullness of apprehension, had all
          passed away, and the foolish questioners and non-receptive listeners
          had been lifted into a higher region, and possessed insight, courage,
          confidence. The last sublime utterance of our Lord had gathered all
          the scattered rays into a beam so bright that the blindest could not
          but see, and the coldest could not but be warmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet the calm, clear eye of Christ sees something not wholly
          satisfactory in this outpouring of the disciples' confidence. He does
          not reject their imperfect faith, but He warns them, as if seeing the
          impending hour of denial which was so terribly to contradict the
          rapture of that moment. And then, with most pathetic suddenness, He
          passes from them to Himself; and in a singularly blended utterance
          lets us get a glimpse into His deep solitude and the companions that
          shared it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My words now make no attempt at anything more than is involved in
          following the course of thought in the words before us.
        </p>
        <p>I. Note the disciples' joyful confession.</p>
        <p>
          Their words are permeated throughout with allusions to the previous
          promises and sayings of our Lord, and the very allusions show how
          shallow was their understanding of what they thought so plain. He had
          said to them that, in that coming day which was so near its dawn, He
          would speak to them 'no more in proverbs, but show them plainly of the
          Father'; and they answer, with a kind of rapture of astonishment, that
          the promised day has come already, and that even now He is speaking to
          them 'plainly,' and without mysterious sayings. Did they understand
          His words when they thought them so plain? 'I came forth from the
          Father, and am come into the world? Again I leave the world and go
          unto the Father,' that summary statement of the central mysteries of
          Christianity, which the generations have found to be inexhaustible,
          and which to so many minds has been absolutely incredible, seemed to
          the shallow apprehension of these disciples to be sun-clear. If they
          had understood what He meant, could they have spoken thus, or have
          left Him so soon?
        </p>
        <p>
          They begin with what they believed to be a fact, His clear utterance.
          Then follows a conviction which has allusion to His previous words.
          'Now', say they, 'we know that Thou knowest all things, and needest
          not that any man should ask Thee.' He had said to them, 'In that day
          ye shall ask Me nothing'; and from the fact that he had interpreted
          their unspoken words, and had anticipated their desire to ask what
          they durst not ask, they draw, and rightly draw, the conclusion of His
          divine Omniscience. They think that therein, in His answer to their
          question before it is asked, is the fulfilment of that great promise.
          Was that all that He meant? Certainly not. Did He merely mean to say,
          'You will ask Me nothing, because I shall know what you want to know,
          without your asking'? No! But He meant, 'Ye shall ask Me nothing,
          because in that day you will have with you an illuminating Spirit who
          will solve all your difficulties.' So, again, a shallow interpretation
          empties the words which they accept of their deepest and most precious
          meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then they take yet a further step. First, they begin with a fact;
          then from that they infer a conviction; and now, upon the basis of the
          inferred conviction, they rear a faith, 'We believe that Thou camest
          forth from God.' But what they meant by 'coming forth from God' fell
          far short of the greatness of what He meant by the declaration, and
          they stand, in this final, articulate confession of their faith, but a
          little in advance of Nicodemus the Rabbi, and behind Peter the Apostle
          when he said: 'Thou art the Son of the living God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          So their confession is a strangely mingled warp and woof of insight
          and of ignorance. And they may stand for us both as examples to teach
          us what we ought to be, and as beacons teaching us what we should not
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me note just one or two lessons drawn from the disciples'
          demeanour and confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first remark that I would make is that here we learn what it is
          that gives life to a creed -- experience. These men had, over and over
          again, in our Lord's earlier utterances, heard the declaration that
          'He came forth from God'; and in a sort of fashion they believed it.
          But, as so many of our convictions do, it lay dormant and half dead in
          their souls. But now, rightly or wrongly, experience had brought them
          into contact, as they thought, with a manifest proof of His divine
          Omniscience, and the torpid conviction flashed all up at once into
          vitality. The smouldering fire of a mere piece of abstract belief was
          kindled at once into a glow that shed warmth through their whole
          hearts; and although they had professed to believe long ago that He
          came from God, now, for the first time, they grasp it as a living
          reality. Why? Because experience had taught it to them. It is the only
          teacher that teaches us the articles of our creed in a way worth
          learning them. Every one of us carries professed beliefs, which lie
          there inoperative, bedridden, in the hospital and dormitory of our
          souls, until some great necessity or sudden circumstance comes that
          flings a beam of light upon them, and then they start and waken. We do
          not know the use of the sword until we are in battle. Until the
          shipwreck comes, no man puts on the lifebelt in his cabin. Every one
          of as has large tracts of Christian truth which we think we most
          surely believe, but which need experience to quicken them, and need us
          to grow up into the possession of them. Of all our teachers who turn
          beliefs assented to into beliefs really believed none is so mighty as
          Sorrow; for that makes a man lay a firm hold on the deep things of
          God's Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then another lesson that I draw from this glad confession is -- the
          bold avowal that always accompanies certitude. These men's stammering
          tongues are loosed. They have a fact to base themselves upon. They
          have a piece of assured knowledge inferred from the fact. They have a
          faith built upon the certitude of what they know. Having this, out it
          all comes in a gush. No man that believes with all his heart can help
          speaking. You silent Christians are so, because you do not more than
          half grasp the truth that you say you hold. 'Thy word, when shut up in
          my bones, was like a fire'; and it ate its way through all the dead
          matter that enclosed it, until at last it flamed out heaven high. Can
          you say, 'We know and we believe,' with unfaltering confidence? Not
          'we argue'; not 'we humbly venture to think that on the whole'; not
          'we are inclined rather to believe'; but 'we <i>know</i> -- that Thou
          knowest all things, and that Thou hast come from God.' Seek for that
          blessed certitude of knowledge, based upon the facts of individual
          experience, which 'makes the tongue of the dumb sing,' and changes all
          the deadness of an outward profession of Christianity into a living,
          rejoicing power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, further, I draw this lesson. Take care of indolently supposing
          that you understand the depths of God's truth. These Apostles fancied
          that they had grasped the whole meaning of the Master's words, and
          were glad in them. They fed on them, and got something out of them;
          but how far they were from the true perception of their meaning! This
          generation abhors mystery, and demands that the deepest truths of the
          highest subject, which is religion, shall be so broken down into
          mincemeat that the 'man in the street' can understand them in the
          intervals of reading the newspaper. There are only too many of us who
          are disposed to grasp at the most superficial interpretation of
          Christian truth, and lazily to rest ourselves in that. A creed which
          has no depth in it is like a picture which has no distance. It is flat
          and unnatural, and self-condemned by the very fact. It is better that
          we should feel that the smallest word that comes from God is like some
          little leaf of a water plant on the surface of a pond; if you lift
          that you draw a whole trail after it, and nobody knows how far off and
          how deep down are the roots. It is better that we should feel how
          Infinity and Eternity press in upon us on all sides, and should take
          as ours the temper that recognises that till the end we are but
          learners, seeing 'in a glass, in a riddle,' and therefore patiently
          waiting for light and strenuously striving to stretch our souls to the
          width of the infinite truth of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So, then, look, in the second place, at the sad questions and
          forebodings of the Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Do ye <i>now</i> believe?' That does not cast doubt on the reality of
          their faith so much as on its permanence and power. 'Behold the hour
          cometh that ye shall be scattered' -- as He had told them a little
          while before in the upper room, like a flock when the shepherd is
          stricken down -- 'every man to his own.' He does not reject their
          imperfect homage, though He discerns so clearly its imperfection and
          its transiency, but sadly warns them to beware of the fleeting nature
          of their present emotion; and would seek to prepare them, by the
          knowledge, for the terrible storm that is going to break upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let us learn two or three simple lessons. One is that the dear Lord
          accepts imperfect surrender, ignorant faith and love, of which He
          knows that it will soon turn to denial. Oh! if He did not, what would
          become of us all? <i>We</i> reject half hearts; we will not have a
          friendship on which we cannot rely. The sweetness of vows is all
          sucked out of them to our apprehension, if we have reason to believe
          that they will be falsified in an hour. But the patient Master was
          willing to put up with what you and I will not put up with; and to
          accept what we reject; and be pleased that they gave Him even that.
          His 'charity suffereth long, and is kind.' Let us not be afraid to
          bring even imperfect consecration --
        </p>
        <p>'A little faith all undisproved' --</p>
        <p>to His merciful feet.</p>
        <p>
          Then another lesson is the need for Christian men sedulously to search
          and make sure that their inward life corresponds with their words and
          professions. I wonder how many thousands of people will stand up this
          day and say, 'I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus
          Christ His only Son,' whose words would stick in their throats if that
          question of the Master's was put to them, '<i>Do</i> ye now believe?'
          And I wonder how many of us are the fools of our own verbal
          acknowledgments of Christ. Self-examination is not altogether a
          wholesome exercise, and it may easily be carried too far, to the
          destruction of the spontaneity and the gladness of the Christian life.
          A man may set his pulse going irregularly by simply concentrating his
          attention upon it, and there may be self- examination of the wrong
          sort, which does harm rather than good. But, on the other hand, we all
          need to verify our position, lest our outward life should fatally slip
          away from correspondence with our inward. Our words and acts of
          Christian profession and service are like bank notes. What will be the
          end if there is a whole ream of such going up and down the world, and
          no balance of bullion in the cellars to meet them? Nothing but
          bankruptcy. Do you see to it that your reserve of gold, deep down in
          your hearts, always leaves a margin beyond the notes in circulation
          issued by you. And in the midst of your professions hear the Master
          saying, '<i>Do ye</i> now believe?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Another lesson that I draw is, trust no emotions, no religious
          experiences, but only Him to whom they turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          These men were perfectly sincere, and there was a glow of gladness in
          their hearts, and a real though imperfect faith when they spoke. In an
          hours time where were they?
        </p>
        <p>
          We often deal far too hard measure to these poor disciples, in our
          estimate of their conduct at that critical moment. We talk about them
          as cowards. Well, they were better and they were worse than cowards;
          for their courage failed second, but their faith had failed first. The
          Cross made them dastards because it destroyed their confidence in
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          'We <i>trusted</i>.' Ah! what a world of sorrow there is in those two
          final letters of that word! 'We trusted that it had been He who should
          have redeemed Israel.' But they do not trust it any more, and so why
          should they put themselves in peril for One on whom their faith can no
          longer build?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would we have been any better if we had been there? Suppose you had
          stood afar off and seen Jesus die on the cross, would your faith have
          lived? Do we not know what it is to be a great deal more exuberant in
          our professions of faith -- and real faith it is, no doubt -- in some
          quiet hour when we are with Him by ourselves, than when swords are
          flashing and we are in the presence of His antagonists? Do we not know
          what it is to grasp conviction at one moment, and the next to find it
          gone like a handful of mist from our clutch? Is our Christian life
          always lived upon one high uniform level? Have we no experience of
          hours of exhaustion coming after deep religious emotion? 'Let him that
          is without sin among you cast the first stone'; there will not be many
          stones flung if that law be applied. Let us all, recognising our own
          weakness, trust to nothing, either in our convictions or our emotions,
          but only to Him, and cry, 'Hold Thou me up, and I shall be safe!'
        </p>
        <p>III. Lastly, note the lonely Christ and His companion.</p>
        <p>
          'Ye shall leave Me alone'; there is sadness, though it be calm, in
          that clause, and then, I suppose, there was a moment's pause before
          the quiet voice began again: 'And yet I am not alone, for the Father
          is with Me.' There are two currents there, both calm; but the one
          bright and the other dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus was the loneliest man that ever lived. All other forms of human
          solitude were concentrated in His. He knew the pain of unappreciated
          aims, unaccepted love, unbelieved teachings, a heart thrown back upon
          itself. No man understood Him, no man knew Him, no man deeply and
          thoroughly loved Him or sympathised with Him, and He dwelt apart. He
          felt the pain of solitude more sharply than sinful men do. Perfect
          purity is keenly susceptible; a heart fully charged with love is
          wounded sore when the love is thrown back, and all the more sorely the
          more unselfish it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solitude was no small part of the pain of Christ's passion. Remember
          the pitiful appeal in Gethsemane, 'Tarry ye here and watch with Me!'
          Remember the threefold vain return to the sleepers in the hope of
          finding some sympathy from them. Remember the emphasis with which,
          more than once in His life, He foretold the loneliness of His death.
          And then let us understand how the bitterness of the cup that He drank
          had for not the least bitter of its ingredients the sense that He
          drank it alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, dear friends! some of us, no doubt, have to live outwardly
          solitary lives. We all of us live alone after all fellowship and
          communion. Physicists tell us that in the most solid bodies the atoms
          do not touch. Hearts come closer than atoms, but yet, after all, we
          die alone, and in the depths of our souls we all live alone. So let us
          be thankful that the Master knows the bitterness of solitude, and has
          Himself trod that path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have here the calm consciousness of unbroken communion. Jesus
          Christ's sense of union with the Father was deep, close, constant, in
          manner and measure altogether transcending any experience of ours. But
          still He sets before us a pattern of what we should aim at in these
          great words. They show the path of comfort for every lonely heart. 'I
          am not alone, for the Father is with Me.' If earth be dark, let us
          look to Heaven. If the world with its millions seems to have no friend
          in it for us, let us turn to Him who never leaves us. If dear ones are
          torn from our grasp, let us grasp God. Solitude is bitter; but, like
          other bitters, it is a tonic. It is not all loss if the trees which
          with their leafy beauty shut out the sky from us are felled, and so we
          see the blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's company is to us what the Father's fellowship was to Christ.
          He has borne solitude that He might be the companion of all the
          lonely, and the same voice which said, 'Ye shall leave Me alone,' said
          also, 'I am with you always, even to the end of the world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But <i>that</i> communion of Christ with the Father was broken, in
          that awful hour when He cried: 'My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?' We
          tread there on the verge of mysteries, beyond our comprehension; but
          this we know -- that it was our sin and the world's, made His by His
          willing identifying of Himself with us, which built up that black wall
          of separation. That hour of utter desolation, forsaken by God,
          deserted by men, was the hour of the world's redemption. And Jesus
          Christ was forsaken by God and deserted by men, that you and I might
          never be either the one or the other, but might find in His sweet and
          constant companionship at once the society of man and the presence of
          God.
