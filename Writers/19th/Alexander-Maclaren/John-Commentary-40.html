          'There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
          Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other
          of His disciples.' -- JOHN xxi.2.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chapter, containing the infinitely significant and pathetic
          account of our Lord's appearance to these disciples by the Sea of
          Tiberias, is evidently an appendix to the Gospel of John. The design
          of that Gospel is complete with the previous chapter, and there is a
          formal close, as of the whole book, at the end thereof. But whilst
          obviously an appendix, this chapter is as obviously the work of the
          same hand as wrote the Gospel. There are many minute points of
          identity between the style of it and of the rest of the work, so that
          there can be no difficulty or doubt as to whence it came. This
          enumeration of these seven disciples, regarded as being the work of
          John himself, seems to me to be significant, and to contain a good
          many lessons. And I desire to turn to these now.
        </p>
        <p>I. First of all, the fact that they were together is significant.</p>
        <p>
          How did they come to hold together? How had they not yielded to the
          temptation to seek safety by flight, which would have been the natural
          course after the death of their Leader on a charge of treason against
          the Roman power? The process of disintegration had begun, and we see
          it going on in the conduct of the disciples before the Resurrection.
          The 'Shepherd was smitten,' and, as a matter of course, 'the sheep'
          began to 'scatter.' And yet here we find them back in Galilee, in
          their old haunts, and not trying to escape by separation, which would
          have been the first step suggested to ordinary men in an ordinary
          state of things. But where everybody knew them, and they knew
          everybody, and everybody knew them to be disciples of Jesus Christ,
          thither they go, and hold together as if they had still a living
          centre and a uniting bond. How did that come about? The fact that
          after Christ's death there was a group of men united together simply
          and solely as disciples, and exhibiting their unity as disciples
          conspicuously, in the face of the men that knew them best, this forms
          a strange phenomenon that needs an explanation. And there is only one
          explanation of it, that Jesus Christ had risen from the dead. That
          drew them together once more. You cannot build a Church on a dead
          Christ; and of all the proofs of the Resurrection, I take it that
          there is none that it is harder for an unbeliever to account for, in
          harmony with his hypothesis, than the simple fact that Christ's
          disciples held together after He was dead, and presented a united
          front to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, the fact of the group is itself significant, and we may
          claim it as being a morsel of evidence for the historical veracity of
          the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>II. Then the composition of this group is significant.</p>
        <p>
          Taken in comparison with the original nucleus of the Church, the
          calling of which we find recorded in the first chapter of this Gospel,
          it is to be noticed that of the five men who made the Primitive
          Church, there are three who reappear here by name -- viz. Simon Peter,
          John and Nathanael, and Nathanael never appears anywhere else except
          in these two places. Then, note that there are two unnamed men here,
          'two other of His disciples'; who, I think, in all probability are the
          two of the original five that we do not find named here -- viz.
          'Philip and Andrew, Simon Peter's brother' -- both of them connected
          with Bethsaida, the place where probably this appearance of the risen
          Lord took place.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, then, I think, the fair inference from the list before us is that
          we have here the original nucleus again, the first five, with a couple
          more, and the couple more are 'Thomas, who is called Didymus' -- and
          we shall see the reason for <i>his</i> presence in a moment -- and the
          brother of John, one of the first pair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, to the original little group that had gathered round Him
          at the first, and to whom He had been so often manifested in this very
          scene where they were standing now, He is revealed again. There, along
          the beach, is the place where James and John and Simon and Andrew were
          called from their nets three short years ago. Across yonder, on the
          other side of the lake, is the bit of green grass where the thousands
          were fed. Behind it is the steep slope down which the devil-possessed
          herd rushed. There, over the shoulder of the hill, is the road that
          leads up to Cana of Galilee, which they had trod together on that
          never-to-be-forgotten first morning, and from which little village one
          of the group came. They who had companied with Him all the time of His
          too short fellowship, and had seen all His manifestations, were
          fittingly chosen to be the recipients of this last appearance, which
          was to be full of instruction as to the work of the Church, its
          difficulties, its discouragements, its rewards, its final success, and
          His benediction of it until the very end of time. It was not for
          nothing that they who were gathered together were that first nucleus
          of the Church, who received again from their Master the charge to be
          'fishers of men.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, if we look at the list, having regard to the history of
          those that make it up, it seems to me that that also brings us some
          valuable considerations. Foremost stand, as receiving this great
          manifestation of Jesus Christ, the two greatest sinners of the whole
          band, 'Simon Peter, and Thomas, which is called Didymus,' the denier
          and the doubter. Singularly contrasted these two men were in much of
          their disposition; and yet alike in the fact that the Crucifixion had
          been too much for their faith. The one of them was impetuous, the
          other of them slow. The one was always ready to say more than he
          meant; the other always ready to do more than he said. The one was
          naturally despondent, disposed to look ahead and to see the gloomiest
          side of everything -- 'Let us also go that we may die with Him' -- the
          other never looking an inch beyond his nose, and always yielding
          himself up to the impulse of the moment. And yet both of them were
          united in this, that the one, from a sudden wave of cowardice which
          swept him away from his deepest convictions and made him for an hour
          untrue to his warmest love, and the other, from giving way to his
          constitutional tendency to despondency, and to taking the blackest
          possible view of everything -- they had both of them failed in their
          faith, the one turning out a denier and the other turning out a
          doubter. And yet here they are, foremost upon the list of those who
          saw the Risen Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, there are two lessons there, and the one is this -- let us
          Christian people learn with what open hearts and hands we should
          welcome a penitent when he comes back. The other is, -- let us learn
          who they are to whom Jesus Christ deigns to manifest Himself -- not
          immaculate monsters, but men that, having fallen, have learned
          humility and caution, and by penitence have risen to a securer
          standing, and have turned even their transgressions into steps in the
          ladder that lifts them to Christ. It was something that the first to
          whom the risen Saviour appeared when He came victorious and calm from
          the grave, was the woman 'out of whom He had cast seven devils,' and
          the blessed truth which that teaches is the same as that which is to
          be drawn from this list of those whom He regarded, and whom we regard,
          as then constituting the true nucleus of His Church -- a list which is
          headed by the blackest denier and the most obstinate and captious
          sceptic in the whole company. 'There were together Simon Peter and
          Thomas, which is called Didymus,' and the little group was glad to
          have them, and welcomed them, as it becomes us to welcome brethren who
          have fallen, and who come again saying, 'I repent.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, take the next: he was 'Nathanael, of Cana in Galilee'; a
          guileless 'Israelite indeed,' so swift to believe, so ready with his
          confession, so childlike in his wonder, so ardent in his love and
          faith. The only thing that Christ is recorded as having said to him is
          this: 'Because I said... believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things
          than these.' A promise of growing clearness of vision and growing
          fullness of manifestation was made to this man, who never appears
          anywhere else in Scripture but in these two scenes, and so may stand
          to us as the type of the opposite kind of Christian experience from
          that stormy one of the doubter and the denier -- viz. that of
          persistent, quiet, continuous growth, which is marked by faithful use
          of the present amount of illumination, and is rewarded by a continual
          increase of the same. If the keynote to the two former lives is, that
          sin confessed helps a man to climb, the keynote to this man's is the
          other truth, that they are still more blessed who, with no
          interruptions, backslidings, inconsistencies, or denials, by patient
          continuousness in well-doing, widen the horizon of their Christian
          vision and purge their eyesight for daily larger knowledge. To these,
          as to the others, there is granted the vision of the risen Lord, and
          to them also is entrusted the care of His sheep and His lambs. We do
          not <i>need</i> to go away into the depths and the darkness in order
          to realise the warmth and the blessedness of the light. There is no
          <i>necessity</i> that any Christian man's career should be broken by
          denials like Peter's or by doubts like Thomas's, but we may 'grow in
          grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.' 'So is the
          kingdom of heaven, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full
          corn in the ear.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, still further, there were here 'the two sons of Zebedee.' These
          were the men of whom the Master said that they were 'sons of thunder,'
          who, by natural disposition, in so far as they resembled one another
          (which they seem to have done), were eager, energetic, somewhat
          bigoted, ready with passionate rebukes, and not unwilling to invoke
          destructive vengeance, all for the love of Him. They were also touched
          with some human ambition which led them to desire a place at His right
          hand and His left, but the ambition, too, was touched with love
          towards Him, which half redeemed it. But by dwelling with Him one of
          them, at least, had become of all the group the likest his Master. And
          the old monastic painters taught a very deep truth when, in their
          pictures of the apostles, they made John's almost a copy of the
          Master's face. To him, too, there was granted in like manner a place
          amongst this blessed company, and it is surely a trace of
          <i>his</i> hand that his place should seem so humble. Any other but
          himself would certainly have put James and John in their natural place
          beside Peter. It must have been himself who slipped himself and his
          brother into so inconspicuous a position in the list, and further
          veiled his personality under the patronymic, 'the sons of Zebedee.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Last of all come 'two other of His disciples,' not worth naming.
          Probably, as I have said, they were the missing two out of the five of
          the first chapter; but possibly they were only 'disciples' in the
          wider sense, and not of the Apostolic group at all. Nobody can tell.
          What does it matter? The lesson to be gathered from their presence in
          this group is one that most of us may very well take to heart. There
          is a place for commonplace, undistinguished people, whose names are
          not worth repeating in any record; there is a place for us one-
          talented folk, in Christ's Church, and we, too, have a share in the
          manifestation of His love. We do not need to be brilliant, we do not
          need to be clever, we do not need to be influential, we do not need to
          be energetic, we do not need to be anything but quiet, waiting souls,
          in order to have Christ showing Himself to us, as we toil wearily
          through the darkness of the night. Undistinguished disciples have a
          place in His heart, a sphere and a function in His Church, and a share
          in His revelation of Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The last point that I touch is this, that the purpose of this
          group is significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          What did they thus get together for? 'Simon Peter saith, I go a
          fishing. They say, We also go with thee.' So they went back again to
          their old trade, and they had not left the nets and the boats and the
          hired servants for ever, as they once thought they had.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sent them back? Not doubt or despair; because they had seen Jesus
          Christ up in Jerusalem, and had come down to Galilee at His command on
          purpose to meet Him. 'There shall ye see Him, lo! I have told you,'
          was ringing in their ears, and they went back in full confidence of
          His appearance there. It is very like Peter that he should have been
          the one to suggest filling an hour of the waiting time with manual
          labour. The time would be hanging heavily on his hands. John could
          have 'sat still in the house,' like Mary, the heart all the busier,
          because the hands lay quietly in the lap. But that was not Peter's
          way, and John was ready to keep him company. Peter thought that the
          best thing they could do, till Jesus chose to come, was to get back to
          their work, and he was sensible and right. The best preparation for
          Christ's appearance, and the best attitude to be found in by Him, is
          doing our daily work, however secular and small it may be. A dirty,
          wet fishing boat, all slimy with scales, was a strange place in which
          to wait for the manifestation of a risen Saviour. But it was the right
          place, righter than if they had been wandering about amongst the
          fancied sanctities of the synagogues.
        </p>
        <p>
          They went out to do their work; and to them was fulfilled the old
          saying, 'I, being in the way, the Lord met me.' Jesus Christ will come
          to you and me in the street if we carry the waiting heart there, and
          in the shop, and the factory, and the counting-house, and the kitchen,
          and the nursery, and the study, or wherever we may be. For all things
          are sacred when done with a hallowed heart, and He chooses to make
          Himself known to us amidst the dusty commonplaces of daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had said to them before the Crucifixion: 'When I sent you forth
          without purse or scrip, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.'
          And then He said, as changing the conditions: 'But now he that hath a
          purse or scrip, let him take it.' As long as He was with them they
          were absolved from these common tasks. Now that He had left them the
          obligation recurred. And the order of things for His servants in all
          time coming was therein declared to be: no shirking of daily tasks on
          the plea of wanting divine communications; keep at your work, and if
          it last all night, stick to it; and if there are no fish in the net,
          never mind; out with it again. And be sure that sooner or later you
          will see Him standing on the beach, and hear His voice, and be blessed
          by His smile.
