          'As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you: continue ye In My
          love. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I
          have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These
          things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and
          that your joy might be full.' -- JOHN xv.9-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last of these verses shows that they are to be taken as a kind of
          conclusion of the great parable of the Vine and the branches, for it
          looks back and declares Christ's purpose in His preceding utterances.
          The parable proper is ended, but the thoughts of it still linger in
          our Lord's mind, and echo through His words, as the vibration of some
          great bell after the stroke has ceased. The main thoughts of the
          parable were these two, that participation in Christ's life was the
          source of all good, and that abiding in Him was the means of
          participation in His life. And these same thoughts, though modified in
          their form, and free from the parabolical element, appear in the words
          that we have to consider on this occasion. The parable spoke about
          abiding in Christ; our text defines that abiding, and makes it still
          more tender and gracious by substituting for it, 'abiding in His
          love.' The parable spoke of conduct as 'fruit,' the effortless result
          of communion with Jesus. Our text speaks of it with more emphasis laid
          on the human side, as 'keeping the commandments.' The parable told us
          that abiding in Christ was the condition of bearing fruit. Our text
          tells us the converse, which is also true, that bearing fruit, or
          keeping the commandments, is the condition of abiding in Christ. So
          our Lord takes His thought, as it were, and turns it round before us,
          letting us see both sides of it, and then tells us that He does all
          this for one purpose, which in itself is a token of His love, namely,
          that our hearts may be filled with perfect and perennial joy, a drop
          from the fountain of His own.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three verses have three words which may be taken as their key-
          notes -- love, obedience, joy. We shall look at them in that order.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have here the love in which it is our sweet duty to
          abide. 'As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you. Abide ye in
          My love.'
        </p>
        <p>
          What shall we say about these mysterious and profound first words of
          this verse? They carry us into the very depths of divinity, and
          suggest for us that wonderful analogy between the relation of the
          Father to the Son, and that of the Son to His disciples, which appears
          over and over again in the solemnities of these last hours and words
          of Jesus. Christ here claims to be, in a unique and solitary fashion,
          the Object of the Father's love, and He claims to be able to love like
          God. 'As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you'; as deeply, as
          purely, as fully, as eternally, and with all the unnameable
          perfectnesses which must belong to the divine affection, does Christ
          declare that He loves us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know not whether the majesty and uniqueness of His nature stand out
          more clearly in the one or in the other of these two assertions. As
          beloved of God, and as loving like God, He equally claims for Himself
          a place which none other can fill, and declares that the love which
          falls on us from His pierced and bleeding heart is really the love of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this mysterious, awful, tender, perfect affection He exhorts us to
          abide. That comes yet closer to our hearts than the other phrase of
          which it is the modification, and in some sense the explanation. The
          command to abide in Him suggests much that is blessed, but to have all
          that mysterious abiding in Him resolved into abiding in His love is
          infinitely tenderer, and draws us still closer to Himself. Obviously,
          what is meant is not our continuance in the attitude of love to Him,
          but rather our continuance in the sweet and sacred atmosphere of His
          love to us. For the connection between the two halves of the verse
          necessarily requires that the love in which we are to abide should be
          identical with the love which had been previously spoken of, and
          <i>that</i> is clearly His love to us, and not ours to Him. But then,
          on the other hand, whosoever thus abides in Christ's love to Him will
          echo it back again, in an equally continuous love to Him. So that the
          two things flow together, and to abide in the conscious possession of
          Christ's love to me is the certain and inseparable cause of its
          effect, my abiding in the continual exercise and outgoing of my love
          to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now note that this continuance in Christ's love is a thing in our
          power, since it is commanded. Although it is His affection to us of
          which my text primarily speaks, I can so modify and regulate the flow
          of that divine love to my heart that it becomes my duty to continue in
          Christ's love to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a quiet, blessed home that is for us! The image, I suppose, that
          underlies all this sweet speech in these last hours, about dwelling in
          Christ, in His joy, in His words, in His peace, and the like, is that
          of some safe house, into which going, we may be secure. And what
          sorrow or care or trouble or temptation would be able to reach us if
          we were folded in the protection of that strong love, and always felt
          that it was the fortress into which we might continually resort? They
          who make their abode there, and dwell behind those firm bastions, need
          fear no foes, but are lifted high above them all. 'Abide in My love,'
          for they who dwell within the clefts of that Rock need none other
          defence; and they to whom the riven heart of Christ is the place of
          their abode are safe, whatsoever befalls. 'As the Father hath loved
          Me, so have I loved you. Abide ye in My love.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now note, secondly, the obedience by which we continue in Christ's
          love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analogy, on which He has already touched, is still continued. 'If
          ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have
          kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.' Note that Christ
          here claims for Himself absolute and unbroken conformity with the
          Father's will, and consequent uninterrupted and complete communion
          with the Father's love. It is the utterance of a nature conscious of
          no sin, of a humanity that never knew one instant's film of
          separation, howsoever thin, howsoever brief, between Him and the
          Father. No more tremendous words were ever spoken than these quiet
          ones in which Jesus Christ declares that never, all His life long, had
          there been the smallest deflection or want of conformity between the
          Father's will and <i>His</i> desires and doings, and that never had
          there been one grain of dust, as it were, between the two polished
          plates which adhered so closely in inseparable union of harmony and
          love.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then notice, still further, how Christ here, with His
          consciousness of perfect obedience and communion, intercepts
          <i>our</i> obedience and diverts it to Himself. He does not say, 'Obey
          God as I have done, and He will love you'; but He says, 'Obey
          <i>Me</i> as I obey God, and <i>I</i> will love you.' Who is this that
          thus comes between the child's heart and the Father's? Does He come
          <i>between</i> when He stands thus? or does He rather lead us up to
          the Father, and to a share in His own filial obedience?
        </p>
        <p>
          He further assures us that, by keeping His commandments, we shall
          continue in that sweet home and safe stronghold of His love. Of course
          the keeping of the commandments is something more than mere outward
          conformity by action. It is the inward harmony of will, and the bowing
          of the whole nature. It is, in fact, the same thing (though considered
          under a different aspect, and from a somewhat different point of
          view), as He has already been speaking about as the 'fruit' of the
          vine, by the bearing of which the Father is glorified. And this
          obedience, the obedience of the hands because the heart obeys, and
          does so because it loves, the bowing of the will in glad submission to
          the loved and holy will of the heavens -- this obedience is the
          condition of our continuing in Christ's love.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will love us better, the more we obey His commandments, for
          although His tender heart is charged towards all, even the
          disobedient, with the love of pity and of desire to help, He cannot
          but feel a growing thrill of satisfied and gratified affection towards
          us, in the measure in which we become like Himself. The love that wept
          over us, when we were enemies, will 'rejoice over us with singing,'
          when we are friends. The love that sought the sheep when it was
          wandering will pour itself yet more tenderly and with selector gifts
          upon it when it follows in the footsteps of the flock, and keeps close
          at the heels of the Good Shepherd. 'If ye keep My commandments, ye
          shall abide in My love,' so we will put nothing between us and Him
          which will make it impossible for the tenderest tenderness of that
          holy love to come to your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The obedience which we render for love's sake will make us more
          capable of receiving, and more blessedly conscious of possessing, the
          love of Jesus Christ. The lightest cloud before the sun will prevent
          it from focussing its rays to a burning point on the convex glass. And
          the small, thin, fleeting, scarcely visible acts of self-will that
          sometimes pass across our skies will prevent our feeling the warmth of
          that love upon our shrouded hearts. Every known piece of rebellion
          against Christ will shatter all true enjoyment of His favour, unless
          we are hopeless hypocrites or self-deceived. The condition of knowing
          and feeling the warmth and blessedness of Christ's love to me is the
          honest submission of my nature to His commandments. You cannot rejoice
          in Jesus Christ unless you do His will. You will have no real comfort
          and blessedness in your religion unless it works itself out in your
          daily lives. That is why so many of you know nothing, or next to
          nothing, about the joy of Christ's felt presence, because you do not,
          for all your professions, hourly and momentarily regulate and submit
          your wills to His commandments. Do what He wants, and do it because He
          wants it, if you wish that His love should fill your hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, further, we shall continue in His love by obedience, inasmuch as
          every emotion which finds expression in our daily life is strengthened
          by the fact that it is expressed. The love which works is love which
          grows, and the tree that bears fruit is the tree that is healthy and
          increases. So note how all these deepest things of Christian teaching
          come at last to a plain piece of practical duty. We talk about the
          mysticism of John's Gospel, about the depth of these last sayings of
          Jesus Christ. Yes! they are mystical, they are deep -- unfathomably
          deep, thank God! -- but connected by the shortest possible road with
          the plainest possible duties. 'Let no man deceive you. He that doeth
          righteousness is righteous.' It is of no use to talk about communion
          with Jesus Christ, and abiding in Him, in possession of His love, and
          all those other properly mystical sides of Christian experience,
          unless you verify them for yourselves by the plain way of practice.
          Doing as Christ bids us, and doing that habitually, and doing it
          gladly, then, and only then, are we in no danger of losing ourselves
          on the heights, or of forgetting that Christ's mission has for its
          last result the influencing of character and of conduct. 'If ye keep
          My commandments, ye shall abide in My love, even as I have kept My
          Father's commandments, and abide in His love.'
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, note the joy which follows on this practical obedience.
          'These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain,' (or
          'might <i>be</i>') 'in you, and that your joy might be full.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'My joy might be in you' -- a strange time to talk of His 'joy.' In
          half an hour he would be in Gethsemane, and we know what happened
          there. Was Christ a joyful man? He was a 'Man of sorrows' but one of
          the old Psalms says, 'Thou hast loved righteousness ... therefore God
          hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.' The
          deep truth that lies there is the same that He here claims as being
          fulfilled in His own experience, that absolute surrender and
          submission in love to the beloved commands of a loving Father made Him
          -- in spite of sorrows, in spite of the baptism with which He was
          baptized, in spite of all the burden and the weight of our sins -- the
          most joyful of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          This joy He offers to us, a joy coming from perfect obedience, a joy
          coming from a surrender of self at the bidding of love, to a love that
          to us seems absolutely good and sweet. There is no joy that humanity
          is capable of to compare for a moment with that bright, warm,
          continuous sunshine which floods the soul, that is freed from all the
          clouds and mists of self and the darkness of sin. Self- sacrifice at
          the bidding of Jesus Christ is the recipe for the highest, the most
          exquisite, the most godlike gladnesses of which the human heart is
          capable. Our joy will remain if His joy is ours. Then our joy will be,
          up to the measure of its capacity, ennobled, and filled, and
          progressive, advancing ever towards a fuller possession of His joy,
          and a deeper calm of that pure and perennial rapture, which makes the
          settled and celestial bliss of those who have 'entered into the joy of
          their Lord.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Brother! there is only one gladness that is worth calling so -- and
          that is, that which comes to us, when we give ourselves utterly away
          to Jesus Christ, and let Him do with us as He will. It is better to
          have a joy that is central and perennial -- though there may be, as
          there will be, a surface of sorrow and care -- than to have the
          converse, a surface of joy, and a black, unsympathetic kernel of
          aching unrest and sadness. In one or other of these two states we all
          live. Either we have to say, 'as sorrowful yet always rejoicing' or we
          have to feel that 'even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, and the
          end of that mirth is heaviness.' Let us choose for ourselves, and let
          us choose aright, the gladness which coils round the heart, and
          endures for ever, and is found in submission to Jesus Christ, rather
          than the superficial, fleeting joys which are rooted on earth and
          perish with time.
