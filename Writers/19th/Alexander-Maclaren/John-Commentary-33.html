          'These things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A
          bone of Him shall not be broken.' -- JOHN xix.36.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Evangelist, in the words of this text, points to the great Feast
          of the Passover and to the Paschal Lamb, as finding their highest
          fulfilment, as he calls it, in Jesus Christ. For this purpose of
          bringing out the correspondence between the shadow and the substance
          he avails himself of a singular coincidence concerning a perfectly
          unimportant matter -- viz., the abnormally rapid sinking of Christ's
          physical strength in the crucifixion, by which the final indignity of
          breaking the bones of the sufferers was avoided in His case. John
          sees, in that entirely insignificant thing, a kind of fingerpost
          pointing to far more important, deeper, and real correspondences. We
          are not to suppose that he was so purblind, and attached so much
          importance to externals, as that this outward coincidence exhausted in
          his conception the correspondence between the two. But It was a trifle
          that suggested a greater matter. It was a help aiding gross
          conceptions and common minds to grasp the inward relation between
          Jesus and that Passover rite. But just as our Lord would have
          fulfilled the prophecy about the King coming 'meek, and having
          salvation,' though He had never ridden on a literal ass into the
          literal Jerusalem, so our Lord would have 'fulfilled' the shadow of
          the Passover with the substance of His own sacrifice if there had
          never been this insignificant correspondence, in outward things,
          between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          But whilst my text is the Evangelist's commentary, the question
          arises, How did he come to recognise that our Lord was all which that
          Passover signified? And the answer is, he recognised it through
          Christ's own teaching. He does not record the institution of the
          Lord's Supper. It did not fall into his scheme to deal with external
          events of that sort, and he knew that it had been sufficiently taught
          by the three earlier Gospels, to which his is a supplement. But though
          he did not narrate the institution, he takes it for granted in the
          words of my text, and his vindication of his seeing the fulfilment of
          'A bone of Him shall not be broken' in the incident to which I have
          referred, lies in this, that Jesus Christ Himself swept away the
          Passover and substituted the memorial feast of the Lord's Supper.
          'This do in remembrance of Me,' said at the table where the Paschal
          lamb had been eaten, sufficiently warrants John's allusion here.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then, marking the fact that our Evangelist is but carrying out the
          lesson that he had learned in the upper room, we may fairly take the
          identification of the Paschal lamb with the crucified Christ as being
          the last instance in which our Lord Himself laid His hand upon Old
          Testament incidents and said, 'They all mean Me.' And it is from that
          point of view, and not merely for the purpose of dealing with the
          words that I have read as our starting-point, that I wish to speak
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Now then, the first thing that strikes me is that in this
          substitution of Himself for the Passover we have a strange instance of
          Christ's supreme authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to fling yourself back in imagination to that upper room, where
          Jesus and a handful of Galileans were sitting, and remember the
          sanctity which immemorial usage had cast round that centre and apex of
          the Jewish ritual, established at the Exodus by a solemn divine
          appointment, intended to commemorate the birth of the nation,
          venerable by antiquity and association with the most vehement
          pulsations of national feeling, the centre point of Jewish religion.
          Christ said: 'Put it all away; do not think about the Exodus; do not
          think about the destroying Angel; do not think about the deliverance.
          Forget all the past; do this in remembrance of Me.' Take into account
          that the Passover had a double sacredness, as a religious festival,
          and also as commemorating the birthday of the nation, and then
          estimate what a strange sense of His own importance the Man must have
          had who said: 'That past is done with, and it is <i>Me</i> that you
          have to think of now.' If I might venture to take a very modern
          illustration without vulgarising a great thing, suppose that on the
          other side of the Atlantic somebody were to stand up and say, 'I
          abrogate the Fourth of July and Independence Day. Do not think about
          Washington and the establishment of the United States any more. Think
          about me!' That is exactly what Jesus Christ did. Only instead of a
          century there were millenniums of observance which He thus laid aside.
          So I say that is a strange exercise of authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it imply? It implies two things, and I must say a word about
          each of them. It implies that Christ regarded the whole of the ancient
          system of Judaism, its history, its law, its rites of worship, as
          pointing onwards to Himself, that He recognised in it a system the
          whole <i>raison d'etre</i> of which was anticipatory and preparatory
          of Himself. For Him the Decalogue was given, for Him priests were
          consecrated, for Him kings were anointed, for Him prophets spake, for
          Him sacrifices smoked, for Him festivals were appointed, and the
          nation and its history were all one long proclamation: 'The King
          cometh! go ye forth to meet Him.' You cannot get less than that out of
          the way in which He handled, as is told in this Gospel, Jacob's
          ladder, the Serpent in the wilderness, the Manna that fell from
          Heaven, the Pillar of Cloud that led the people, the Rock that gushed
          forth water, and now, last of all, the Passover, which was the very
          shining apex of the whole sacrificial and ritual system.
        </p>
        <p>
          And remember, too, that this way of dealing with all the institutions
          of the nation as meaning, in their inmost purpose, Himself, is exactly
          parallel to His way of dealing with the sacred words of Mosaic
          commandment and prohibition in the Sermon on the Mount, where He set
          side by side as of equal -- I was going to say, and I should have been
          right in saying, identical -- authority what was 'said to them of old
          time' and what 'I say unto you.' Amidst the dust of our present
          controversies as to the processes by which, and the times at which,
          the Old Testament books assumed their present form, there is grave
          danger that the essential thing about the whole matter should be
          obscured. The way in which what is called Higher Criticism may finally
          locate the origins and dates of the various parts of that ancient
          record and that ancient system does not in the slightest degree affect
          the outstanding characteristic of the whole, that it is the product of
          the divine hand, working (if you will) through men who had more
          freedom of action whilst they were its organs than our grandfathers
          thought. Be it so; but still that divine Hand shaped the whole in
          order that, besides its educational effects upon the generations that
          received it, there should shine through it all the expectation of the
          coming King. And I venture to say that, however grateful we may be to
          modern investigation for light upon these other points to which I have
          referred, the ignorant reader that reads Jesus Christ into all the Old
          Testament may be very uncritical and mistaken in regard to details,
          but he has got hold of the root of the matter, and is nearer to the
          apprehension of the essence and spirit and purpose of the ancient
          Revelation than the most learned critic who does not see that it is
          the preparation for, and the prophecy of, Jesus Christ Himself. And
          the vindication of such a position lies in this, among other facts,
          that He in the upper room, in harmony with, and in completion of, all
          that He had previously spoken about His relation to the Old Testament,
          claimed the Passover as the prophecy of Himself, and said, 'I am the
          Lamb of God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not dwell, I suppose, on the other consideration that is
          involved in this strange exercise of authority -- viz., the
          naturalness, as without any sense of doing anything presumptuous or
          extraordinary, with which Christ assumes His right to handle divine
          appointments with the most perfect freedom, to modify them, to reshape
          them, to divert them from their first purpose, and to enjoin them with
          an authority equal to that with which the Lord said unto Moses, 'Keep
          ye this day through your generations.' There is only one supposition
          on which I, for my part, can understand that conduct -- that He was
          the possessor of authority the same as the Authority that had
          originally instituted the rite.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, dear brethren! when our Lord said, 'Do this in remembrance of
          Me,' I pray you to ask yourselves, What did that involve in regard to
          His nature and the source of His authority over us? And what did it
          involve in regard to His relation to that ancient Revelation?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now another point that I would suggest is -- we have, in this
          substitution of the new rite for the old, our Lord's clear declaration
          of what was the very heart of His work in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This do in remembrance of Me.' What is it, then, to which He points?
          Is it to the wisdom, the tenderness, the deep beauty, the flashing
          moral purity that gleamed and shone lambent in His words? No! Is it to
          the gracious self -- oblivion, the gentle accessibility, the loving
          pity, the leisurely heart always ready to help, the eye ready to fill
          with tears, the hand ever outstretched and ever laden with blessings?
          No! It is the death on the Cross which He, if I might so say,
          isolates, at least which He underscores with red lines, and which He
          would have us remember, as we remember nothing else. Brethren, rites
          are insignificant in many aspects, but are often of enormous
          importance as witnesses to truths. And I point to the Lord's Supper,
          the one rite of the Christian Church, which is to be repeated over and
          over and over again, and see in it the great barrier which has
          rendered it impossible, and will render it impossible, as I believe,
          for evermore, that a Christianity, which obscures the atoning
          sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, should ever pose as the full
          representation of the Master's mind, or as the full expression of the
          Saviour's word.
        </p>
        <p>
          What do men and churches that falter in their allegiance to the truth
          of Christ's redemptive death do with the Lord's Supper? Nothing! For
          the most part they ignore it, or if they retain it, do not, for the
          life of them, know how to explain it, or why it should be there. The
          explanation of why it is there is the great truth, of which it is the
          clear utterance and the strong defence, the truth that 'Jesus Christ
          died for our sins according to the Scriptures,' and that 'the Son of
          Man came... to give His life a ransom for the many.'
        </p>
        <p>
          What did that Passover say? Two things it said, the blood that was
          sprinkled on the lintels and on the door-posts was the token to the
          destroying Angel, as with his broad, silent pinions he swept through
          the land, bringing a blacker night into Egyptian darkness, and leaving
          behind him no house 'in which there was not one dead.' All the houses
          of which the occupants had put the ruddy mark on the lintels and on
          the doorposts, and were wise enough not to go forth from behind the
          shelter of that mark on the door, were safe when the morning dawned.
          And so to us all who, by our sinfulness, have brought down upon our
          heads exposedness to that retribution, which, in a righteously
          governed universe, must needs follow sin, and to that death which the
          separation from God -- the necessary result of sin -- most surely is,
          there is proffered in that great Sacrifice shelter from the destroying
          sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that is not all. Whilst the blood on the posts meant security, the
          Lamb on the table meant emancipation. So they who find in the dying
          Christ their exemption from the last consequences of transgression,
          find, in partaking of the Christ whose sacrifice is their pardon, the
          communication of a new power, which sets them free from a worse than
          Egyptian bondage, and enables them to shake from their emancipated
          limbs the fetters of the grimmest of the Pharaohs that have wielded a
          tyrannous dominion over them. Pardon and freedom, the creation of a
          nation subject only to the law of Jehovah Himself -- these were the
          facts that the Passover festival and the Passover lamb signified, and
          these are the facts which, in nobler fashion, are brought to us by
          Jesus Christ. So, I beseech you, let Him teach you what His work in
          the world is, as He lays His own hand on that highest of the ancient
          festivals, and endorses the Baptist's declaration, 'Behold the Lamb of
          God, which taketh away the sin of the world!'
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, lastly, let me ask you to notice how, in this regal and
          authoritative dealing by our Lord with that ancient festival, there
          lies a loving provision for our weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely we may venture to say that Jesus Christ desired to be
          remembered, even by that handful of poor people, and by us, not only
          for our sakes, but because His heart, too, craved that He should not
          be forgotten by those whom He was leaving. As you may remember, the
          dying king turned to the bishop standing by him, with the enigmatical
          word which no one understood but the receiver of it -- 'Remember!' so
          did Jesus Christ. He appeals to our thankfulness, He appeals to our
          affections, He lets us see that He wishes to live in our memories,
          because He delights in it, as well as because it is for our profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Passover was purely and simply a rite of remembrance. I venture to
          believe that the Lord's Supper is nothing more. I know how people talk
          about the bare, bald, Zwinglian ideas of the Communion. They do look
          very bald and bare by the side of modern notions and mediaeval notions
          resuscitated. Well, I had rather have the bareness than I would have
          it overlaid by coverings under which there is room for abundance of
          vermin to lurk. Christ puts the Lord's Supper in the place of the
          Passover. The Passover was a purely memorial rite. You Christian
          people will understand the spirituality of the whole Gospel system,
          and the nature of the only bond which unites men to Jesus and brings
          spiritual blessings to them -- viz. faith -- all the better, the more
          you cling, in spite of all that is going on round us to-day, to that
          simple, intelligible, Scriptural notion that we commemorate the
          Sacrifice, not offer the Sacrifice. Jesus Christ said that the Lord's
          Supper was to be observed 'in remembrance of Me.' That was His
          explanation of its purpose, and I for one am content to take as the
          expounder of the laws of the feast, the feast's own Founder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now one more word. In the Passover men fed on the Sacrifice. Jesus
          Christ presents Himself to each of us as at once the Sacrifice for our
          sins and the Food of our souls. If you will keep your minds in touch
          with the truth about Him, and with Him whom the truth about Him
          reveals to you, if you will keep your hearts in touch with that great
          and unspeakable sign of God's love, if you will keep your wills in
          submission to His authority, if you will let His blood, 'which is the
          life,' or as you may otherwise word it, His Spirit, come into your
          lives, and be your spirit, your motive, then you will go out from the
          table, not like the disciples to flee, and deny, and forget, nor like
          the Israelites to wander in a wilderness, but strengthened for many a
          day of joyous service and true communion, and will come at last to
          what He has promised us: 'Ye shall sit with Me at My table in My
          Kingdom,' whence we shall go 'no more out.'
