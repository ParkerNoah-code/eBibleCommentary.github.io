          'Of sin, because they believe not on Me; Of righteousness, because I
          go to My Father, and ye see Me no more; Of judgment, because the
          prince of this world is judged.' -- JOHN xvi.9-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord has just been telling His disciples how He will equip them,
          as His champions, for their conflict with the world. A divine Spirit
          is coming to them who will work in them and through them; and by their
          simple and unlettered testimony will 'convict,' or convince, the mass
          of ungodly men of error and crime in regard to these three things --
          sin, righteousness, and judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He now advances to tell them that this threefold conviction which
          they, as counsel for the prosecution, will establish as against the
          world at the bar, will be based upon three facts: first, a truth of
          experience; second, a truth of history; third, a truth of revelation,
          all three facts having reference to Jesus Christ and His relation to
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these three facts are -- the world's unbelief; Christ's ascension
          and session at the right hand of God; and the 'judgment of the prince
          of this world.' If we remember that what our Lord is here speaking
          about is the work of a divine Spirit through the ministration of
          believing men, then Pentecost with its thousands 'pricked to the
          heart,' and the Roman ruler who trembled, as the prisoner 'reasoned of
          righteousness and judgment to come,' are illustrations of the way in
          which the humble disciples towered above the pride and strength of the
          world, and from criminals at its bar became its accusers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three facts are the staple and the strength of the Christian
          ministry. These three facts are misapprehended, and have failed to
          produce their right impression, unless they have driven home to our
          consciences and understandings the triple conviction of my text. And
          so I come to you with the simple questions which are all-important for
          each of us: Have you looked these three facts in the face -- unbelief,
          the ascended Christ, a judged prince of the world, and have you
          learned their meaning as it bears on your own character and religious
          life?
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first point here is the rejection of Jesus Christ as the climax
          of the world's sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strange words! They are in some respects the most striking instance of
          that gigantic self-assertion of our Lord, of which we have had
          occasion to see so many examples in these valedictory discourses. The
          world is full of all unrighteousness and wickedness, lust and
          immorality, intemperance, cruelty, hatred; all manner of buzzing evils
          that stink and sting around us. But Jesus Christ passes them all by
          and points to a mere negative thing, to an inward thing, to the
          attitude of men towards Himself; and He says, 'If you want to know
          what sin is, look at that!' <i>There</i> is the worst of all sins.
          There is a typical instance of what sin is, in which, as in some
          anatomical preparation, you may see all its fibres straightened out
          and made visible. Look at that if you want to know what the world is,
          and what the world's sin is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of us do not think that it is sin at all; and tell us that man is
          no more responsible for his belief than he is for the colour of his
          hair, and suchlike talk. Well, let me put a very plain question: What
          is it that a man turns away from when he turns away from Jesus Christ?
          The plainest, the loveliest, the loftiest, the perfectest revelation
          of God in His beauty and completeness that ever dawned, or ever will
          dawn upon creation. He rejects that. Anything more? Yes! He turns away
          from the loveliest human life that ever was, or will be, lived.
          Anything more? Yes! He turns away from a miracle of self- sacrificing
          love, which endured the Cross for enemies, and willingly embraced
          agony and shame and death for the sake of those who inflicted them
          upon Him. Anything more? Yes! He turns away from hands laden with, and
          offering him, the most precious and needful blessings that a poor soul
          on earth can desire or expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if this be true, if unbelief in Jesus Christ be indeed all this
          that I have sketched out, another question arises, What does such an
          attitude and act indicate as to the rejector? He stands in the
          presence of the loveliest revelation of the divine nature and heart,
          and he sees no light in it. Why, but because he has blinded his eyes
          and cannot behold? He is incapable of seeing 'God manifest in the
          flesh,' because he 'loves the darkness rather than the light.' He
          turns away from the revelation of the loveliest and most self-
          sacrificing love. Why, but because he bears in himself a heart cased
          with brass and triple steel of selfishness, against the manifestation
          of love? He turns away from the offered hands heaped with the
          blessings that he needs. Why, but because he does not care for the
          gifts that are offered? Forgiveness, cleansing, purity a heaven which
          consists in the perfecting of all these, have no attractions for him.
          The fugitive Israelites in the wilderness said, 'We do not want your
          light, tasteless manna. It may do very well for angels, but we have
          been accustomed to garlic and onions down in Egypt. They smell strong,
          and there is some taste in <i>them</i>. Give us <i>them</i>.' And so
          some of you say, 'The offer of pardon is of no use to me, for I am not
          troubled with my sin. The offer of purity has no attraction to me, for
          I rather like the dirt and wallowing in it. The offer of a heaven of
          your sort is but a dreary prospect to me. And so I turn away from the
          hands that offer precious things.' The man who is blind to the God
          that beams, lambent and loving, upon him in the face of Jesus Christ
          -- the man who has no stirrings of responsive gratitude for the great
          outpouring of love upon the Cross -- the man who does not care for
          anything that Jesus Christ can give him, surely, in turning away,
          commits a real sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not deny, of course, that there may be intellectual difficulties
          cropping up in connection with the acceptance of the message of
          salvation in Jesus Christ, but as, on the one hand, I am free to admit
          that many a man may be putting a true trust in Christ which is joined
          with a very hesitant grasp of some of the things which, to me, are the
          very essence and heart of the Gospel; so, on the other side, I would
          have you remember that there is necessarily a moral quality in our
          attitude to all moral and religious truth; and that sin does not cease
          to be sin because its doer is a thinker or has systematised his
          rejection into a creed. Though it is not for us to measure motives and
          to peer into hearts, at the bottom there lies what Christ Himself put
          His finger on: 'Ye <i>will</i> not come to me that ye might have
          life.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, still further, let me remind you that our Lord here presents
          this fact of man's unbelief as being an instance in which we may see
          what the real nature of sin is. To use learned language, it is a
          'typical' sin. In all other acts of sin you get the poison manipulated
          into various forms, associated with other elements, disguised more or
          less. But here, because it is purely an inward act having relation to
          Jesus Christ, and to God manifested in Him, and not done at the
          bidding of the animal nature, or of any of the other strong
          temptations and impulses which hurry men into gross and coarse forms
          of manifest transgression, you get sin in its essence. Belief in
          Christ is the surrender of myself. Sin is living to myself rather than
          to God. And there you touch the bottom. All those different kinds of
          sin, however unlike they may be to one another -- the lust of the
          sensualist, the craft of the cheat, the lie of the deceitful, the
          passion of the unregulated man, the avarice of the miser -- all of
          them have this one common root, a diseased and bloated regard to self.
          The definition of sin is, -- living to myself and making myself my own
          centre. The definition of faith is, -- making Christ my centre and
          living for Him. Therefore, if you want to know what is the sinfulness
          of sin, there it is. And if I may use such a word in such a
          connection, it is all packed away in its <i>purest</i> form in the act
          of rejecting that Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brother, it is no exaggeration to say that, when you have summoned up
          before you the ugliest forms of man's sins that you can fancy, this
          one overtops them all, because it presents in the simplest form the
          mother-tincture of all sins, which, variously coloured and perfumed
          and combined, makes the evil of them all. A heap of rotting, poisonous
          matter is offensive to many senses, but the colourless, scentless,
          tasteless drop has the poison in its most virulent form, and is not a
          bit less virulent, though it has been learnedly distilled and
          christened with a scientific name, and put into a dainty jewelled
          flask. 'This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
          and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are
          evil.' I lay that upon the hearts and consciences of some of my
          present hearers as the key to their rejection or disregard of Christ
          and His salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, secondly, notice the ascension of Jesus Christ as the pledge
          and the channel of the world's righteousness -- 'Because I go to the
          Father, and ye see Me no more.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He speaks as if the process of departure were already commenced. It
          had three stages -- death, resurrection, ascension; but these three
          are all parts of the one departure. And so He says: 'Because, in the
          future, when ye go forth to preach in My name, I shall be there with
          the Father, having finished the work for which He sent Me; therefore
          you will convince the world of righteousness.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let me put that briefly in two forms. First of all, the fact of an
          ascended Christ is the guarantee and proof of His own complete
          fulfilment of the ideal of a righteous man. Or to put it into simpler
          words, suppose Jesus Christ is dead; suppose that He never rose from
          the grave; suppose that His bones mouldered in some sepulchre; suppose
          that there had been no ascension -- would it be possible to believe
          that He was other than an ordinary man? And would it be possible to
          believe that, however beautiful these familiar records of His life,
          and however lovely the character which they reveal, there was really
          in Him no sin at all? A dead Christ means a Christ who, like the rest
          of us, had His limitations and His faults. But, on the other hand, if
          it be true that He sprang from the grave because 'it was not possible
          that He should be holden of it,' and because in His nature there was
          no proclivity to death, since there had been no indulgence in sin; and
          if it be true that He ascended up on high because that was His native
          sphere, and He rose to it as naturally as the water in the valley will
          rise to the height of the hill from which it has descended, then we
          can see that God has set His seal upon that life by that resurrection
          and ascension; and as we gaze on Him swept up heavenward by His own
          calm power, a light falls backward upon all His earthly life, upon His
          claims to purity, and to union with the Father, and we say, 'Surely
          this was a perfectly righteous Man.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And further let me remind you that with the supernatural facts of our
          Lord's resurrection and ascension stands or falls the possibility of
          His communicating any of His righteousness to us sinful men. If there
          be no such possibility, what does Jesus Christ's beauty of character
          matter to me? Nothing! I shall have to stumble on as best I can,
          sometimes ashamed and rebuked, sometimes stimulated and sometimes
          reduced to despair, by looking at the record of His life. If He be
          lying dead in a forgotten grave, and hath not 'ascended up on high,'
          then there can come from His history and past nothing other in kind,
          though, perhaps, a little more in degree, than comes from the history
          and the past of the beautiful and white souls that have sometimes
          lived in the world. He is a saint like them, He is a teacher like
          them, He is a prophet like some of them, and we have but to try our
          best to copy that marble purity and white righteousness. But if He
          hath ascended up on high, and sits there, wielding the forces of the
          universe, as we believe He does, then to Him belongs the divine
          prerogative of imparting His nature and His character to them that
          love Him. Then His righteousness is not a solitary, uncommunicative
          perfectness for Himself, but like a sun in the heavens, which streams
          out vivifying and enlightening rays to all that seek His face. If it
          be true that Christ has risen, then it is also true that you and I,
          convicted of sin, and learning our weakness and our faults, may come
          to Him, and by the exercise of that simple and yet omnipotent act of
          faith, may ally our incompleteness with His perfectness, our sin with
          His righteousness, our emptiness with His fullness, and may have all
          the grace and the beauty of Jesus Christ passing over into us to be
          the Spirit of life in us, 'making us free from the law of sin and
          death.' If Christ be risen, His righteousness may be the world's; if
          Christ be not risen, His righteousness is useless to any but to
          Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          My brother, wed yourself to that dear Lord by faith in Him, and His
          righteousness will become yours, and you will be 'found in Him without
          spot and blameless,' clothed with white raiment like His own, and
          sharing in the Throne which belongs to the righteous Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Lastly, notice the judgment of the world's prince as the prophecy
          of the judgment of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are here upon ground which is only made known to us by the
          revelation of Scripture. We began with a fact of man's experience; we
          passed on to a fact of history; now we have a fact certified to us
          only on Christ's authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world <i>has</i> a prince. That ill-omened and chaotic
          agglomeration of diverse forms of evil has yet a kind of anarchic
          order in it, and, like the fabled serpent's locks on the Gorgon head,
          they intertwine and sting one another, and yet they are a unity. We
          hear very little about 'the prince of the world' in Scripture.
          Mercifully the existence of such a being is not plainly revealed until
          the fact of Christ's victory over him is revealed. But however
          ludicrous mediaeval and vulgar superstitions may have made the notion,
          and however incredible the tremendous figure painted by the great
          Puritan poet has proved to be, there is nothing ridiculous, and
          nothing that we have the right to say is incredible, in the plain
          declarations that came from Christ's lips over and over again, that
          the world, the aggregate of ungodly men, <i>has</i> a prince.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then my text tells us that that prince is 'judged.' The Cross did
          that, as Jesus Christ over and over again indicates, sometimes in
          plain words, as 'Now is the judgment of this world,' 'Now is the
          prince of this world cast out'; sometimes in metaphor, as 'I beheld
          Satan as lightning fall from heaven,' 'First bind the strong man and
          then spoil his house.' We do not know how far-reaching the influences
          of the Cross may be, and what they may have done in those dark
          regions, but we know that since that Cross, the power of evil in the
          world has been broken in its centre, that God has been disclosed, that
          new forces have been lodged in the heart of humanity, which only need
          to be developed in order to overcome the evil. We know that since that
          auspicious day when 'He spoiled principalities and powers, making a
          show of them openly and leading them in triumph,' even when He was
          nailed upon the Cross, the history of the world has been the judgment
          of the world. Hoary iniquities have toppled into the ceaseless washing
          sea of divine love which has struck against their bases. Ancient evils
          have vanished, and more are on the point of vanishing. A loftier
          morality, a higher notion of righteousness, a deeper conception of
          sin, new hopes for the world and for men, have dawned upon mankind;
          and the prince of the world is led bound, as it were, at the
          victorious chariot wheels. The central fortress has been captured, and
          the rest is an affair of outposts.
        </p>
        <p>
          My text has for its last word this -- the prince's judgment prophesies
          the world's future judgment. The process which began when Jesus Christ
          died has for its consummation the divine condemnation of all the evil
          that still afflicts humanity, and its deprivation of authority and
          power to injure. A final judgment will come, and that it will is
          manifested by the fact that Christ, when He came in the form of a
          servant and died upon the Cross, judged the prince. When He comes in
          the form of a King on the great White Throne He will judge the world
          which He has delivered from its prince.
        </p>
        <p>
          That thought, my brother, ought to be a hope to us all. Are you glad
          when you think that there is a day of judgment coming? Does your heart
          leap up when you realise the fact that the righteousness, which is in
          the heavens, is sure to conquer and coerce and secure under the
          hatches the sin that is riding rampant through the world? It was a joy
          and a hope to men who did not know half as much of the divine love and
          the divine righteousness as we do. They called upon the rocks and the
          hills to rejoice, and the trees of the forest to clap their hands
          before the Lord, 'for He cometh to judge the world.' Does your heart
          throb a glad Amen to that?
        </p>
        <p>
          It ought to be a hope; it is a fear; and there are some of us who do
          not like to have the conviction driven home to us, that the end of the
          strife between sin and righteousness is that Jesus Christ shall judge
          the world and take unto Himself His eternal kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my friends, hope or fear, it is a fact, as certain in the future,
          as the Cross is sure in the past, or the Throne in the present. Let me
          ask you this question, the question which Christ has sent all His
          servants to ask -- Have you loathed your sin? have you opened your
          heart to Christ's righteousness? If you have, when men's hearts are
          failing them for fear, and they 'call on the rocks and the hills to
          cover them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the Throne,' you
          will 'have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept,' and
          lift up your heads, 'for your redemption draweth nigh.' 'Herein is our
          love made perfect, that we may have boldness before Him in the day of
          judgment.'
        </p>
