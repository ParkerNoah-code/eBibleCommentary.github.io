          'And after eight days, again His disciples were within, and Thomas
          with them. Then came Jesus.' -- JOHN xx.26.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is nothing more remarkable about the narrative of the
          resurrection, taken as a whole, than the completeness with which our
          Lord's appearances met all varieties of temperament, condition, and
          spiritual standing. Mary, the lover; Peter, the penitent; the two
          disciples on the way to Emmaus, the thinkers; Thomas, the stiff
          unbeliever -- the presence of the Christ is enough for them all; it
          cures those that need cure, and gladdens those that need gladdening. I
          am not going to do anything so foolish as to try to tell over again,
          less vividly, this well-known story. We all remember its outlines, I
          suppose: the absence of Thomas from Christ's first meeting with the
          assembled disciples on Easter evening; the dogged disbelief with which
          he met their testimony; his arrogant assumption of the right to lay
          down the conditions on which he should believe, and Christ's gracious
          acceptance of the conditions; the discovery when they were offered
          that they were not needful; the burst of glad conviction which lifted
          him to the loftiest height reached while Christ was on earth, and then
          the summing up of all in our Lord's words -- 'Blessed are they that
          have not seen and yet have believed!' -- the last Beatitude, that
          links us and all the generations yet to come with the story, and is
          like a finger pointing to it, as containing very special lessons for
          them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I simply seek to try to bring out the force and instructiveness of the
          story. The first point is --
        </p>
        <p>I. The isolation that misses the sight of the Christ.</p>
        <p>
          'Thomas, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.' No
          reason is assigned. The absence may have been purely accidental, but
          the specification of Thomas as 'one of the Twelve,' seems to suggest
          that his absence was regarded by the Evangelist as a dereliction of
          apostolic duty; and the cause of it may be found, I think, with
          reasonable probability, if we take into account the two other facts
          that the same Evangelist records concerning this Apostle. One is his
          exclamation, in which a constitutional tendency to accept the blackest
          possibilities as certainties, blends very strangely and beautifully
          with an intense and brave devotion to his Master. 'Let us also go,'
          said Thomas, when Christ announced His intention, but a few days
          before the Passion, of returning to the grave of Lazarus, 'that we may
          die with Him.' 'He is going to His death, that I am sure of, and I am
          going to be beside Him even in His death.' A constitutional pessimist!
          The only other notice that we have of him is that he broke in -- with
          apparent irreverence which was not real, -- with a brusque
          contradiction of Christ's saying that they knew the way, and they knew
          His goal. 'Lord! we know not whither Thou goest' -- there spoke pained
          love fronting the black prospect of eternal separation, -- 'and how
          can we know the way?' -- there spoke almost impatient despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          So is not that the kind of man who on the Resurrection day would have
          been saying to himself, even more decidedly and more bitterly than the
          two questioning thinkers on the road to Emmaus had said it, 'We
          trusted that this had been He, but it is all over now'? The keystone
          was struck out of the arch, and this brick tumbled away of itself. The
          hub was taken out of the wheel, and the spokes fell apart. The
          divisive tendency was begun, as I have had occasion to remark in other
          sermons. Thomas did the very worst thing that a melancholy man can do,
          went away to brood in a corner by himself, and so to exaggerate all
          his idiosyncrasies, to distort the proportion of truth, to hug his
          despair, by separating himself from his fellows. Therefore he lost
          what they got, the sight of the Lord. He 'was not with them when Jesus
          came.' Would he not have been better in the upper room than gloomily
          turning over in his mind the dissolution of the fair company and the
          shipwreck of all his hopes?
        </p>
        <p>
          May we not learn a lesson? I venture to apply these words, dear
          friends, to our gatherings for worship. The worst thing that a man can
          do when disbelief, or doubt, or coldness shrouds his sky, and blots
          out the stars, is to go away alone and shut himself up with his own,
          perhaps morbid, or, at all events, disturbing thoughts. The best thing
          that he can do is to go amongst his fellows. If the sermon does not do
          him any good, the prayers and the praises and the sense of brotherhood
          will help him. If a fire is going out, draw the dying coals close
          together, and they will make each other break into a flame. One great
          reason for some of the less favourable features that modern
          Christianity presents, is that men are beginning to think less than
          they ought to do, and less than they used to do, of the obligation and
          the blessing, whatever their spiritual condition, of gathering
          together for the worship of God. But, further, there is a far wider
          thought than that here, which I have already referred to, and which I
          do not need to dwell upon, namely, that, although, of course, there
          are very plain limits to be put to the principle, yet it is a
          principle, that solitude is not the best medicine for any disturbed or
          saddened soul. It is true that 'solitude is the mother- country of the
          strong,' and that unless we are accustomed to live very much alone, we
          shall not live very much with God. But on the other hand, if you cut
          yourself off from the limiting, and therefore developing, society of
          your fellows, you will rust, you will become what they call eccentric.
          Your idiosyncrasies will swell into monstrosities, your peculiarities
          will not be subjected to the gracious process of pruning which society
          with your fellows, and especially with Christian hearts, will bring to
          them. And in every way you will be more likely to miss the Christ than
          if you were kindly with your kind, and went up to the house of God in
          company.
        </p>
        <p>Take the next point that is here:</p>
        <p>II. The stiff incredulity that prescribed terms.</p>
        <p>
          When Thomas came back to his brethren, they met him with the witness
          that they had seen the Lord, and he met them as they had met the
          witnesses that brought the same message to them. They had thought the
          women's words 'idle tales.' Thomas gives them back their own
          incredulity. I need not remind you of what I have already had occasion
          to say, how much this frank acknowledgment that none of these, who
          were afterwards to be witnesses of the Resurrection to the world,
          accepted testimony to the Resurrection as enough to convince them,
          enhances the worth of their testimony, and how entirely it shatters
          the conception that the belief in the Resurrection was a mist that
          rose from the undrained swamps of their own heated imaginations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But notice how Thomas exaggerated their position, and took up a far
          more defiant tone than any of them had done. He is called 'doubting
          Thomas.' He was no doubter. Flat, frank, dogged disbelief, and not
          hesitation or doubt, was his attitude. The very form in which he puts
          his requirement shows how he was hugging his unbelief, and how he had
          no idea that what he asked would ever be granted. 'Unless I have so-
          and-so I will not,' indicates an altogether spiritual attitude from
          what 'If I have so-and-so, I will,' would have indicated. The one is
          the language of willingness to be persuaded, the other is a token of a
          determination to be obstinate. What right had he -- what right has any
          man -- to say, 'So-and-so must be made plain to me, or I will not
          accept a certain truth'? You have a right to ask for satisfactory
          evidence; you have no right to make up your minds beforehand what that
          must necessarily be. Thomas showed his hand not only in the form of
          his expression, not only in his going beyond his province and
          prescribing the terms of surrender, but also in the terms which he
          prescribed. True, he is only saying to the other Apostles, 'I will
          give in if I have what you had,' for Jesus Christ had said to them,
          'Handle Me and see!' But although thus they could say nothing in
          opposition, it is clear that he was asking more than was needful, and
          more than he had any right to ask. And he shows his hand, too, in
          another way. 'I will not believe!' -- what business had he, what
          business have you, to bring any question of will into the act of
          belief or credence? Thus, in all these four points, the form of the
          demand, the fact of the demand, the substance of the demand, and the
          implication in it that to give or withhold assent was a matter to be
          determined by inclination, this man stands not as an example of a
          doubter, but as an example, of which there are too many copies amongst
          us always, of a determined disbeliever and rejecter.
        </p>
        <p>So I come to the third point, and that is:</p>
        <p>
          III. The revelation that turned the denier into a rapturous confessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a strange week that must have been between the two Sundays --
          that of the Resurrection and the next! Surely it would have been
          kinder if the Christ had not left the disciples, with their new-found,
          tremulous, raw conviction. It would have been less kind if He had been
          with them, for there is nothing that is worse for the solidity of a
          man's spiritual development than that it should be precipitated, and
          new thoughts must have time to take the shape of the mind into which
          they come, and to mould the shape of the mind into which they come. So
          they were left to quiet reflection, to meditation, to adjust their
          thoughts, to get to understand the bearings of the transcendent fact.
          And as a mother will go a little way off from her little child, in
          order to encourage it to try to walk, they were left alone to make
          experiments of that self-reliance which was also reliance on Him, and
          which was to be their future and their permanent condition. So the
          week passed, and they became steadier and quieter, and began to be
          familiar with the thought, and to see some glimpses of what was
          involved in the mighty fact, of a risen Saviour. Then He comes back
          again, and when He comes He singles out the unbeliever, leaving the
          others alone for the moment, and He gives him back, granted, his
          arrogant conditions. How much ashamed of them Thomas must have been
          when he heard them quoted by the Lord's own lips! How different they
          would sound from what they had sounded when, in the self-sufficiency
          of his obstinate determination, he had blurted them out in answer to
          his brethren's testimony! There is no surer way of making a good man
          ashamed of his wild words than just to say them over again to him when
          he is calm and cool. Christ's granting the request was Christ's
          sharpest rebuke of the request. But there was not only the gracious
          and yet chastising granting of the foolish desire, but there was a
          penetrating warning: 'Be not faithless, but believing.' What did that
          mean? Well, it meant this: 'It is not a question of evidence, Thomas;
          it is a question of disposition. Your incredulity is not due to your
          not having enough to warrant your belief, but to your tendency and
          attitude of mind and heart.' There is light enough in the sun; it is
          our eyes that are wrong, and deep below most questions, even of
          intellectual credence, lies the disposition of the man. The ultimate
          truths of religion cannot be matters of demonstration any more than
          the fundamental truths of any science can be proved; any more than
          Euclid's axioms can be demonstrated; any more than the sense of beauty
          or the ear for music depend on the understanding. 'Be not faithless,
          but believing.' The eye that is sound will see the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there is another lesson here. The words of our Lord, literally
          rendered, are, 'become not faithless, but believing.' There are two
          tendencies at work with us, and the one or the other will
          progressively lay hold upon us, and we shall increasingly yield to it.
          You can cultivate the habit of incredulity until you descend into the
          class of the faithless; or you can cultivate the opposite habit and
          disposition until you rise to the high level of a settled and
          sovereign belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear that Thomas did not reach forth his hand and touch. The
          rush of instantaneous conviction swept him along and bore him far away
          from the state of mind which had asked for such evidence. Our Lord's
          words must have pierced his heart, as he thought: 'Then He was here
          all the while; He heard my wild words; He loves me still.' As
          Nathanael, when he knew that Jesus had seen him under the fig-tree,
          broke out with the exclamation, 'Rabbi! Thou art the Son of God,' so
          Thomas, smitten as by a lightning flash with the sense of Jesus' all-
          embracing knowledge and all-forgiving love, forgets his incredulity
          and breaks into the rapturous confession, the highest ever spoken
          while He was on earth: 'My Lord and my God!' So swiftly did his whole
          attitude change. It was as when the eddying volumes of smoke in some
          great conflagration break into sudden flame, the ruddier and hotter,
          the blacker they were. Sight may have made Thomas believe that Jesus
          was risen, but it was something other and more inward than sight that
          opened his lips to cry, 'My Lord and my God!' Finally, we note --
        </p>
        <p>IV. A last Beatitude that extends to all generations.</p>
        <p>
          'Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed.' I need not
          do more than just in a sentence remind you that we shall very poorly
          understand either this saying or this Gospel or the greater part of
          the New Testament, if we do not make it very clear to our minds that
          'believing' is not credence only but trust. The object of the
          Christian's faith is not a proposition; it is not a dogma nor a truth,
          but a Person. And the act of faith is not an acceptance of a given
          fact, a Resurrection or any other, as true, but it is a reaching out
          of the whole nature to Him and a resting upon Him. I have said that
          Thomas had no right to bring his will to bear on the act of belief,
          considered as the intellectual act of accepting a thing as true. But
          Christian faith, being more than intellectual belief, does involve the
          activity of the will. Credence is the starting-point, but it is no
          more. There may be belief in the truth of the gospel and not a spark
          of faith in the Christ revealed by the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in regard to that lower kind of belief, the assent which does not
          rest on sense has its own blessing. We sometimes are ready to think
          that it would have been easier to believe if 'we had seen with our
          eyes, and our hands had handled the (incarnate) Word of Life' but that
          is a mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          This generation, and all generations that have not seen Him, are not
          in a less advantageous position in regard either to credence or to
          trust, than were those that companied with Him on earth, and the
          blessing Which He breathed out in that upper room comes floating down
          the ages like a perfume diffused through the atmosphere, and is with
          us fragrant as it was in the 'days of His flesh.' There is nothing in
          the world's history comparable to the warmth and closeness of
          conscious contact with that Christ, dead for nearly nineteen centuries
          now, which is the experience today of thousands of Christian men and
          women. All other names pass, and as they recede through the ages,
          thickening veils of oblivion, mists of forgetfulness, gather round
          them. They melt away into the fog and are forgotten. Why is it that
          one Person, and one Person only, triumphs even in this respect over
          space and time, and is the same close Friend with whom millions of
          hearts are in loving touch, as He was to those that gathered around
          Him upon earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the blessing of this faith that does not rest on sense, and
          only in a small measure on testimony or credence? Part of its blessing
          is that it delivers us from the tyranny of sense, sets us free from
          the crowding oppression of 'things seen and temporal'; draws back the
          veil and lets us behold 'the things that are unseen and eternal.'
          Faith is sight, the sight of the inward eye. It is the direct
          perception of the unseen. It sees Him who is invisible. The vision
          which is given to the eye of faith is more real in the true sense of
          that word, more substantial in the true sense of that word, more
          reliable and more near than that sight by which the bodily eye beholds
          external things. We see, when we trust, greater things than when we
          look. The blessing of blessings is that the faith which triumphs over
          the things seen and temporal, brings into every life the presence of
          the unseen Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren! do not confound credence with trust. Remember that trust
          does involve an element of will. Ask yourselves if the things seen and
          temporal are great enough, lasting enough, real enough to satisfy you,
          and then remember whose lips said, 'Become not faithless but
          believing,' and breathed His last Beatitude upon those 'who have not
          seen and yet have believed.' We may all have that blessing lying like
          dew upon us, amidst the dust and scorching heat of the things seen and
          temporal. We shall have it, if our heart's trust is set on Him, whom
          one of the listeners on that Sunday spoke of long after, in words
          which seem to echo that promise, as 'Jesus in whom though now ye see
          Him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
          glory, receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
          souls.'
