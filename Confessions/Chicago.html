      >1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy</a
    >:
  </p>
  <h2>A Short Statement</h2>
  <p>
    <b>1.</b>
    God, who is Himself Truth and speaks truth only, has inspired Holy Scripture
    in order thereby to reveal Himself to lost mankind through Jesus Christ as
    Creator and Lord, Redeemer and Judge. Holy Scripture is God’s witness to
    Himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>2.</b>
    Holy Scripture, being God’s own Word, written by men prepared and
    superintended by His Spirit, is of infallible divine authority in all
    matters upon which it touches: it is to be believed, as God’s instruction,
    in all that it affirms; obeyed, as God’s command, in all that it requires;
    embraced, as God’s pledge, in all that it promises.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3.</b>
    The Holy Spirit, Scripture’s divine Author, both authenticates it to us by
    His inward witness and opens our minds to understand its meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.</b>
    Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in
    all its teaching, no less in what it states about God’s acts in creation,
    about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under
    God, than in its witness to God’s saving grace in individual lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.</b> The authority of Scripture is inescapably impaired if this total
    divine inerrancy is in any way limited or disregarded, or made relative to a
    view of truth contrary to the Bible’s own; and such lapses bring serious
    loss to both the individual and the Church.
  </p>

  <h2>Articles of Affirmation and Denial</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Article I</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the Holy Scriptures are to be received as the authoritative
    Word of God. We deny that the Scriptures receive their authority from the
    Church, tradition, or any other human service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article II</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God
    binds the conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate to
    that of Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that Church creeds, councils, or declarations have authority greater
    than or equal to the authority of the Bible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article III</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the written Word in its entirety is revelation given by God.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that the Bible is merely a witness to revelation, or only becomes
    revelation in encounter, or depends on the responses of men for its
    validity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article IV</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that God who made mankind in His image has used language as a
    means of revelation. We deny that human language is so limited by our
    creatureliness that it is rendered inadequate as a vehicle for divine
    revelation. We further deny that the corruption of human culture and
    language through sin has thwarted God’s work of inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article V</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that God’s revelation within the Holy Scriptures was progressive.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that later revelation, which may fulfill earlier revelation, ever
    corrects or contradicts it. We further deny that any normative revelation
    has been given since the completion of the New Testament writings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article VI</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to the very
    words of the original, were given by divine inspiration. We deny that the
    inspiration of Scripture can rightly be affirmed of the whole without the
    parts, or of some parts but not the whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article VII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that inspiration was the work in which God by His Spirit, through
    human writers, gave us His Word. The origin of Scripture is divine. The mode
    of divine inspiration remains largely a mystery to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that inspiration can be reduced to human insight, or to heightened
    states of consciousness of any kind.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article VIII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that God in His work of inspiration utilized the distinctive
    personalities and literary styles of the writers whom He had chosen and
    prepared.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that God, in causing these writers to use the very words that He
    chose, overrode their personalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article IX</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that inspiration, though not conferring omniscience, guaranteed
    true and trustworthy utterance on all matters of which the Biblical authors
    were moved to speak and write.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that the finitude of fallenness of these writers, by necessity or
    otherwise, introduced distortion or falsehood into God’s Word.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article X</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the
    autographic text of Scripture, which in the providence of God can be
    ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy. We further
    affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the Word of God to the
    extent that they faithfully represent the original.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the
    absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the
    assertion of Biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XI</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that Scripture, having been given by divine inspiration, is
    infallible, so that, far from misleading us, it is true and reliable in all
    the matters it addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that it is possible for the Bible to be at the same time infallible
    and errant in its assertions. Infallibility and inerrancy may be
    distinguished, but not separated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that Scripture in its entirety is inerrant, being free from all
    falsehood, fraud, or deceit.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual,
    religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of
    history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth
    history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on
    creation and the flood.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XIII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm the propriety of using inerrancy as a theological term with
    reference to the complete truthfulness of Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that it is proper to evaluate Scripture according to standards of
    truth and error that are alien to its usage or purpose. We further deny that
    inerrancy is negated by Biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern
    technical precision, irregularities of grammar or spelling, observational
    descriptions of nature, the reporting of falsehoods, the use of hyperbole
    and round numbers, the topical arrangement of material, variant selections
    of material in parallel accounts, or the use of free citations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XIV</b>
  </p>
  <p>We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture.</p>
  <p>
    We deny that alleged errors and discrepancies that have not yet been
    resolved vitiate the truth claims of the Bible.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XV</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is ground in the teaching of the
    Bible about inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that Jesus’ teaching about Scripture may be dismissed by appeals to
    accommodation or to any natural limitation of His humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XVI</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy has been integral to the Church’s
    faith throughout its history.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that inerrancy is a doctrine invented by scholastic Protestantism,
    or is a reactionary position postulated in response to negative higher
    criticism.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XVII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the Scriptures, assuring
    believers of the truthfulness of God’s written Word.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that this witness of the Holy Spirit operates in isolation from or
    against Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XVIII</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that the text of Scripture is to be interpreted by
    grammatico-historical exegesis, taking account of its literary forms and
    devices, and that Scripture is to interpret Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny the legitimacy of any treatment of the text or quest for sources
    lying behind it that leads to relativizing, dehistoricizing, or discounting
    its teaching, or rejecting its claims to authorship.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Article XIX</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We affirm that a confession of the full authority, infallibility, and
    inerrancy of Scripture is vital to a sound understanding of the whole of the
    Christian faith. We further affirm that such confession should lead to
    increasing conformity to the image of Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    We deny that such confession is necessary for salvation. However, we further
    deny that inerrancy can be rejected without grave consequences, both to the
    individual and to the Church.
