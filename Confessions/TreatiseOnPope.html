    <p>
      The Roman Pontiff claims for himself [in the first place] that by divine
      right he is [supreme] above all bishops and pastors [in all Christendom].
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, he adds also that by divine right he has both swords, i.e., the
      authority also of bestowing kingdoms [enthroning and deposing kings,
      regulating secular dominions etc.].
    </p>
    <p>
      And thirdly, he says that to believe this is necessary for salvation. And
      for these reasons the Roman bishop calls himself [and boasts that he is]
      the vicar of Christ on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three articles we hold to be false, godless, tyrannical, and [quite]
      pernicious to the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in order that our proof [reason and opinion] may be [better]
      understood, we shall first define what they call being above all [what it
      means that he boasts of being supreme] by divine right. For they mean that
      he is universal [that the Pope is the general bishop over the entire
      Christian Church], or, as they say, ecumenical bishop, i.e., from whom all
      bishops and pastors throughout the entire world ought to seek ordination
      and [confirmation, who [alone] is to have the right of electing,
      ordaining, confirming, deposing all bishops [and pastors]. Besides this,
      he arrogates to himself the authority to make [all kinds of] laws
      concerning acts of worship, concerning changing the Sacraments [and]
      concerning doctrine, and wishes his articles, his decrees, his laws [his
      statutes and ordinances] to be considered equal to the divine laws [to
      other articles of the Christian Creed and the Holy Scriptures], i.e., he
      holds that by the papal laws the consciences of men are so bound that
      those who neglect them, even without public offense, sin mortally [that
      they cannot be omitted without sin. For he wishes to found this power upon
      divine right and the Holy Scriptures; yea, he wishes to have it preferred
      to the Holy Scriptures and God&#x27;s commands]. And what he adds is still
      more horrible, namely, that it is necessary to believe all these things in
      order to be saved [all these things shall and must be believed at the
      peril of forfeiting salvation].
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, therefore, let us show from the [holy] Gospel that the
      Roman bishop is not by divine right above [cannot arrogate to himself any
      supremacy whatever over] other bishops and pastors.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        I. Luke 22:25. Christ expressly prohibits lordship among the apostles
        [that no apostle should have any supremacy over the rest]. For this was
        the very question, namely, that when Christ spake of His passion, they
        were disputing who should be at the head, and as it were the vicar of
        the absent Christ. There Christ reproves this error of the apostles and
        teaches that there shall not be lordship or superiority among them, but
        that the apostles should be sent forth as equals to the common ministry
        of the Gospel. Accordingly, He says: The kings of the Gentiles exercise
        lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are
        called benefactors, but ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest
        among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
        doth serve. The antithesis here shows [By holding these matters against
        one another one sees] that lordship [among the apostles] is disapproved.
      </p>
      <p>
        II. Matt. 18:2. The same is taught by the parable when Christ in the
        same dispute concerning the kingdom places a little child in the midst,
        signifying that among ministers there is not to be sovereignty, just as
        a child neither takes nor seeks sovereignty for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        III. John 20:21. Christ sends forth His disciples on an equality,
        without any distinction [so that no one of them was to have more or less
        power than any other], when He says: As My Father hath sent Me, even so
        send I you. [These words are clear and plain:] He says that He sends
        them individually in the same manner as He Himself was sent; hence He
        grants to no one a prerogative or lordship above the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        IV. Gal. 2:7f St. Paul manifestly affirms that he was neither ordained
        nor confirmed [and endorsed] by Peter, nor does he acknowledge Peter to
        be one from whom confirmation should be sought. And he expressly
        contends concerning this point that his call does not depend upon the
        authority of Peter. But he ought to have acknowledged Peter as a
        superior if Peter was superior by divine right [if Peter, indeed, had
        received such supremacy from Christ]. Paul accordingly says that he had
        at once preached the Gospel [freely for a long time] without consulting
        Peter. Also: Of those who seemed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were,
        it maketh no matter to me; God accepteth no man&#x27;s person). And:
        They who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me. Since
        Paul, then, clearly testifies that he did not even wish to seek for the
        confirmation of Peter [for permission to preach] even when he had come
        to him, he teaches that the authority of the ministry depends upon the
        Word of God, and that Peter was not superior to the other apostles, and
        that it was not from this one individual Peter that ordination or
        confirmation was to be sought [that the office of the ministry proceeds
        from the general call of the apostles, and that it is not necessary for
        all to have the call or confirmation of this one person, Peter, alone].
      </p>
      <p>
        V. In 1 Cor. 3:6, Paul makes ministers equal, and teaches that the
        Church is above the ministers. Hence superiority or lordship over the
        Church or the rest of the ministers is not ascribed to Peter [in
        preference to other apostles]. For he says thus: All things are yours,
        whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, i.e., let neither the other
        ministers nor Peter assume for themselves lordship or superiority over
        the Church; let them not burden the Church with traditions; let not the
        authority of any avail more than the Word [of God]; let not the
        authority of Cephas be opposed to the authority of the other apostles,
        as they reasoned at that time: &quot;Cephas, who is an apostle of higher
        rank, observes this; therefore, both Paul and the rest ought to observe
        this.&quot; Paul removes this pretext from Peter, and denies [Not so,
        says Paul, and makes Peter doff his little hat, namely, the claim] that
        his authority is to be preferred to the rest or to the Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        VI. The Council of Nice resolved that the bishop of Alexandria should
        administer the churches in the East, and the Roman bishop the suburban,
        i.e., those which were in the Roman provinces in the West. From this
        start by a human law, i.e. the resolution of the Council, the authority
        of the Roman bishop first arose. If the Roman bishop already had the
        superiority by divine law, it would not have been lawful for the Council
        to take any right from him and transfer it to the bishop of Alexandria;
        nay, all the bishops of the East ought perpetually to have sought
        ordination and confirmation from the bishop of Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        VII. Again the Council of Nice determined that bishops should be elected
        by their own churches, in the presence of some neighboring bishop or of
        several. The same was observed [for a long time, not only in the East,
        but] also in the West and in the Latin churches, as Cyprian and
        Augustine testify. For Cyprian says in his fourth letter to Cornelius:
        Accordingly, as regards the divine observance and apostolic practice,
        you must diligently keep and practice what is also observed among us and
        in almost all the provinces, that for celebrating ordination properly,
        whatsoever bishops of the same province live nearest should come
        together with the people for whom a pastor is being appointed, and the
        bishop should be chosen in the presence of the people, who most fully
        know the life of each one, which we also have seen done among us at the
        ordination of our colleague Sabinus, that by the suffrage of the entire
        brotherhood, and by the judgment of the bishops who had assembled in
        their presence, the episcopate was conferred and hands laid on him.
      </p>
      <section>
        <p>
          Cyprian calls this custom
          <em>a divine tradition and an apostolic observance</em>, and affirms
          that it is observed in almost all the provinces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, therefore, neither ordination nor confirmation was sought from
          a bishop of Rome in the greater part of the world in the Latin and
          Greek churches, it is sufficiently apparent that the churches did not
          then accord superiority and domination to the bishop of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such superiority is impossible. For it is impossible for one bishop to
          be the overseer of the churches of the whole world, or for churches
          situated in the most distant lands to seek ordination [for all their
          ministers] from one. For it is manifest that the kingdom of Christ is
          scattered throughout the whole world; and to-day there are many
          churches in the East which do not seek ordination or confirmation from
          the Roman bishop [which have ministers ordained neither by the Pope
          nor his bishops]. Therefore, since such superiority [which the Pope,
          contrary to all Scripture, arrogates to himself] is impossible, and
          the churches in the greater part of the world have not acknowledged
          [nor made use of] it, it is sufficiently apparent that it was not
          instituted [by Christ, and does not spring from divine law].
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Many ancient synods have been proclaimed and held in which the
          bishop of Rome did not preside; as that of Nice and most others. This,
          too, testifies that the Church did not then acknowledge the primacy or
          superiority of the bishop of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Jerome says: If the question is concerning authority, the world is
          greater than the city. Wherever there has been a bishop, whether at
          Rome, or Eugubium, or Constantinople, or Rhegium, or Alexandria, he is
          of the same dignity and priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Gregory, writing to the patriarch at Alexandria, forbids that he be
          called universal bishop. And in the Records he says that in the
          Council of Chalcedon the primacy was offered to the bishop of Rome,
          but was not accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Lastly, how can the Pope be over the entire Church by divine right
          when the Church has the election, and the custom gradually prevailed
          that bishops of Rome were confirmed by the emperors? Also, when for a
          long time there had been contests concerning the primacy between the
          bishops of Rome and Constantinople, the Emperor Phocas finally
          determined that the primacy should be assigned to the bishop of Rome.
          But if the ancient Church had acknowledged the primacy of the Roman
          Pontiff, this contention could not have occurred, neither would there
          have been need of the decree of the emperor.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <p>
      But they cite against us certain passages, namely, Matt. 16:18f : Thou art
      Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church; also: I will give unto
      thee the keys; also John 21:15: Feed My sheep, and some others. But since
      this entire controversy has been fully and accurately treated elsewhere in
      the books of our theologians, and everything cannot be reviewed in this
      place, we refer to those writings, and wish them to be regarded as
      repeated. Yet we shall reply briefly concerning the interpretation [of the
      passages quoted].
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these passages Peter is the representative of the entire assembly
      of apostles [and does not speak for himself alone, but for all the
      apostles], as appears from the text itself. For Christ asks not Peter
      alone, but says: Whom do ye say that I am? And what is here said [to Peter
      alone] in the singular number: I will give unto thee the keys; and
      whatsoever thou shalt bind, etc., is elsewhere expressed [to their entire
      number], in the plural Matt. 18:18: Whatsoever ye shall bind, etc. And in
      John 20:23: Whosesoever sins ye remit, etc. These words testify that the
      keys are given alike to all the apostles and that all the apostles are
      alike sent forth [to preach].
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this, it is necessary to acknowledge that the keys belong
      not to the person of one particular man, but to the Church, as many most
      clear and firm arguments testify. For Christ, speaking concerning the keys
      adds, Matt. 18:19: If two or three of you shall agree on earth, etc.
      Therefore he grants the keys principally and immediately to the Church,
      just as also for this reason the Church has principally the right of
      calling. [For just as the promise of the Gospel belongs certainly and
      immediately to the entire Church, so the keys belong immediately to the
      entire Church, because the keys are nothing else than the office whereby
      this promise is communicated to every one who desires it, just as it is
      actually manifest that the Church has the power to ordain ministers of the
      Church. And Christ speaks in these words: Whatsoever ye shall bind, etc.,
      and indicates to whom He has given the keys, namely, to the Church: Where
      two or three are gathered together in My name. Likewise Christ gives
      supreme and final jurisdiction to the Church, when He says: Tell it unto
      the Church.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it is necessary that in these passages Peter is the
      representative of the entire assembly of the apostles, and for this reason
      they do not accord to Peter any prerogative or superiority, or lordship
      [which he had, or was to have had, in preference to the other apostles].
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as to the declaration: Upon this rock I will build My Church,
      certainly the Church has not been built upon the authority of man, but
      upon the ministry of the confession which Peter made, in which he
      proclaims that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. He accordingly
      addresses him as a minister: Upon this rock, i.e., upon this ministry.
      [Therefore he addresses him as a minister of this office in which this
      confession and doctrine is to be in operation and says: Upon this rock,
      i.e., this preaching and ministry.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the ministry of the New Testament is not bound to places and
      persons as the Levitical ministry, but it is dispersed throughout the
      whole world, and is there where God gives His gifts, apostles, prophets,
      pastors, teachers; neither does this ministry avail on account of the
      authority of any person, but on account of the Word given by Christ. Nor
      does the person of a teacher add anything to this word and office; it
      matters not who is preaching and teaching it; if there are hearts who
      receive and cling to it, to them it is done as they hear and believe.] And
      in this way, not as referring to the person of Peter, most of the holy
      Fathers, as Origen, Cyprian, Augustine, Hilary, and Bede, interpret this
      passage: Upon this rock. Chrysostom says thus: &quot;Upon this rock,&quot;
      not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith
      of Peter. But what was his faith? &quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of
      the living God.&quot; And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that
      he should say, &quot;Thou art the Son of the living God.&quot; Therefore
      the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is
      the foundation of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as to that which is said John 21:15ff : Feed My sheep, and, Lovest
      thou Me more than these? It does not as yet follow hence that a peculiar
      superiority was given Peter. He bids him &quot;feed,&quot; i.e., teach the
      Word [the Gospel], or rule the Church with the Word [the Gospel], which
      Peter has in common with the other apostles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second article is still clearer, that Christ gave to the apostles only
      spiritual power, i.e., the command to teach the Gospel to announce the
      forgiveness of sins, to administer the Sacraments, to excommunicate the
      godless without bodily force [by the Word], and that He did not give the
      power of the sword, or the right to establish, occupy or confer kingdoms
      of the world [to set up or depose kings]. For Christ says, Matt. 28:19-20:
      Go ye, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
      you; also John 20:21: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is manifest that Christ was not sent to bear the sword or possess
      a worldly kingdom [rule in a worldly fashion], as He Himself says, John
      18:36: My kingdom is not of this world. And Paul says, 2 Cor. 1:24: Not
      for that we have dominion over your faith; and 2 Cor. 10:4: The weapons of
      our warfare are not carnal, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, that Christ in His passion is crowned with thorns and led
      forth to be derided in royal purple, this signified that in the future,
      after His spiritual kingdom was despised, i.e., the Gospel was suppressed,
      another kingdom of a worldly kind would be set up [in its place] with the
      pretext of ecclesiastical power. Therefore the Constitution of Boniface
      VIII and the chapter Omnes, Dist. 22 and similar opinions which contend
      that the Pope is by divine right the ruler of the kingdoms of the world,
      are [utterly] false and godless. From this persuasion horrible darkness
      has been brought into the Church, and after that also great commotions
      have arisen in Europe. For the ministry of the Gospel was neglected, the
      knowledge of faith and the spiritual kingdom became extinct, Christian
      righteousness was supposed to be that external government which the Pope
      had established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the Popes began to seize upon kingdoms for themselves; they
      transferred kingdoms, they vexed with unjust excommunications and wars the
      kings of almost all nations in Europe, but especially the German emperors,
      sometimes for the purpose of occupying cities of Italy, at other times for
      the purpose of reducing to subjection the bishops of Germany, and wresting
      from the emperors the conferring of episcopates. Yea, in the Clementines
      it is even written: When the empire is vacant, the Pope is the legitimate
      successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Pope has not only usurped dominion, contrary to Christ&#x27;s
      command, but has also tyrannically exalted himself above all kings. And in
      this matter the deed itself is not to be reprehended as much as it is to
      be detested, that he assigns as a pretext the authority of Christ; that he
      transfers the keys to a worldly government; that he binds salvation to
      these godless and execrable opinions, when he says it is necessary to
      salvation for men to believe that this dominion belongs to him by divine
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since these great errors obscure [the doctrine of] faith and [of] the
      kingdom of Christ they are in no way to be concealed. For the result shows
      that they have been great pests to the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third place, this must be added: Even though the bishop of Rome had
      the primacy and superiority by divine right nevertheless obedience would
      not be due those pontiffs who defend godless services, idolatry, and
      doctrine conflicting with the Gospel. Nay; such pontiffs and such a
      government ought to be held accursed, as Paul clearly teaches, Gal. 1:8:
      Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that
      which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. And in Acts 5:9: We
      ought to obey God rather than men. Likewise the canons also clearly teach
      that a heretical Pope is not to be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Levitical high priest was the chief priest by divine right, and yet
      godless high priests were not to be obeyed, as Jeremiah and other prophets
      dissented from the high priests, the apostles dissented from Caiaphas and
      did not have to obey them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is manifest that the Roman pontiffs, with their adherents, defend
      [and practice] godless doctrines and godless services. And the marks [all
      the vices] of Antichrist plainly agree with the kingdom of the Pope and
      his adherents. For Paul, in describing Antichrist to the Thessalonians,
      calls him 2 Thess. 2:3: an adversary of Christ, who opposeth and exalteth
      himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he as
      God sitteth in the temple of God. He speaks therefore of one ruling in the
      Church, not of heathen kings, and he calls this one the adversary of
      Christ, because he will devise doctrine conflicting with the Gospel, and
      will assume to himself divine authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it is manifest, in the first place, that the Pope rules in the
      Church, and by the pretext of ecclesiastical authority and of the ministry
      has established for himself this kingdom. For he assigns as a pretext
      these words: I will give to thee the keys. Secondly, the doctrine of the
      Pope conflicts in many ways with the Gospel, and [thirdly] the Pope
      assumes to himself divine authority in a threefold manner. First, because
      he takes to himself the right to change the doctrine of Christ and
      services instituted by God, and wants his own doctrine and his own
      services to be observed as divine; secondly, because he takes to himself
      the power not only of binding and loosing in this life, but also the
      jurisdiction over souls after this life; thirdly, because the Pope does
      not want to be judged by the Church or by any one, and puts his own
      authority ahead of the decision of Councils and the entire Church. But to
      be unwilling to be judged by the Church or by any one is to make oneself
      God. Lastly, these errors so horrible, and this impiety, he defends with
      the greatest cruelty, and puts to death those dissenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being the case, all Christians ought to beware of becoming partakers
      of the godless doctrine, blasphemies, and unjust cruelty of the Pope. On
      this account they ought to desert and execrate the Pope with his adherents
      as the kingdom of Antichrist; just as Christ has commanded, Matt. 7:15:
      Beware of false prophets. And Paul commands that godless teachers should
      be avoided and execrated as cursed, Gal. 1:8; Titus 3:10. And he says, 2
      Cor. 6:14: Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what
      communion hath light with darkness?
    </p>
    <p>
      To dissent from the agreement of so many nations and to be called
      schismatics is a grave matter. But divine authority commands all not to be
      allies and defenders of impiety and unjust cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this account our consciences are sufficiently excused; for the errors
      of the kingdom of the Pope are manifest. And Scripture with its entire
      voice exclaims that these errors are a teaching of demons and of
      Antichrist. The idolatry in the profanation of the masses is manifest,
      which, besides other faults [besides being altogether useless] are
      shamelessly applied to most shameful gain [and trafficking]. The doctrine
      of repentance has been utterly corrupted by the Pope and his adherents.
      For they teach that sins are remitted because of the worth of our works.
      Then they bid us doubt whether the remission takes place. They nowhere
      teach that sins are remitted freely for Christ&#x27;s sake, and that by
      this faith we obtain remission of sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they obscure the glory of Christ, and deprive consciences of firm
      consolation, and abolish true divine services, namely, the exercises of
      faith struggling with [unbelief and] despair [concerning the promise of
      the Gospel].
    </p>
    <p>
      They have obscured the doctrine concerning sin, and have invented a
      tradition concerning the enumeration of offenses, producing many errors
      and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have devised, in addition, satisfactions, whereby they have also
      obscured the benefit [and merit] of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these, indulgences have been born, which are pure lies, fabricated
      for the sake of gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, how many abuses and what horrible idolatry the invocation of saints
      has produced!
    </p>
    <p>
      What shameful acts have arisen from the tradition concerning celibacy!
    </p>
    <p>
      What darkness the doctrine concerning vows has spread over the Gospel!
      There they feigned that vows are righteousness before God and merit the
      remission of sins. Thus they have transferred the benefit of Christ to
      human traditions, and have altogether extinguished the doctrine concerning
      faith. They have feigned that the most trifling traditions are services of
      God and perfection and have preferred these to the works of callings which
      God requires and has ordained. Neither are these errors to be regarded as
      light; for they detract from the glory of Christ and bring destruction to
      souls, neither can they be passed by unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to these errors two great sins are added: The first, that he defends
      these errors by unjust cruelty and death-penalties. The second, that he
      wrests the decision from the Church, and does not permit ecclesiastical
      controversies [such matters of religion] to be judged according to the
      prescribed mode; yea he contends that he is above the Council, and can
      rescind the decrees of Councils, as the canons sometimes impudently speak.
      But that this was much more impudently done by the pontiffs, examples
      testify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quest. 9, canon 3, says: No one shall judge the first seat; for the judge
      is judged neither by the emperor, nor by all the clergy, nor by the kings,
      nor by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope exercises a twofold tyranny: he defends his errors by force and
      by murders, and forbids judicial examination. The latter does even more
      injury than any executions because, when the true judgment of the Church
      is removed, godless dogmas and godless services cannot be removed, and for
      many ages they destroy innumerable souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore let the godly consider the great errors of the kingdom of the
      Pope and his tyranny, and let them ponder, first, that the errors must be
      rejected and the true doctrine embraced, for the glory of God and to the
      salvation of souls. Then let them ponder also how great a crime it is to
      aid unjust cruelty in killing saints, whose blood God will undoubtedly
      avenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But especially the chief members of the Church, kings and princes, ought
      to guard the interests of the Church, and to see to it that errors be
      removed and consciences be healed [rightly instructed], as God expressly
      exhorts kings, Ps. 2:10: Be wise, now, therefore, O ye kings; be
      instructed, ye judges of the earth. For it should be the first care of
      kings [and great lords] to advance the glory of God. Therefore it would be
      very shameful for them to lend their influence and power to confirm
      idolatry and infinite other crimes, and to slaughter saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even though the Pope should hold Synods [a Council], how can the
      Church be healed if the Pope suffers nothing to be decreed contrary to his
      will, if he allows no one to express his opinion except his adherents whom
      he has bound by dreadful oaths and curses to the defense of his tyranny
      and wickedness without any exception concerning God&#x27;s Word [not even
      the Word of God being excepted]?
    </p>
    <p>
      But since the decisions of Synods are the decisions of the Church, and not
      of the Popes, it is especially incumbent on kings to check the license of
      the Popes [not allow such wantonness], and to act so that the power of
      judging and decreeing from the Word of God is not wrested from the Church.
      And as the rest of the Christians must censure all other errors of the
      Pope, so they must also rebuke the Pope when he evades and impedes the
      true investigation and true decision of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, even though the bishop of Rome had the primacy by divine right,
      yet since he defends godless services and doctrine conflicting with the
      Gospel, obedience is not due him; yea, it is necessary to resist him as
      Antichrist. The errors of the Pope are manifest and not trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifest also is the cruelty [against godly Christians] which he
      exercises. And it is clear that it is God&#x27;s command that we flee
      idolatry, godless doctrine, and unjust cruelty. On this account all the
      godly have great, compelling, and manifest reasons for not obeying the
      Pope. And these compelling reasons comfort the godly against all the
      reproaches which are usually cast against them concerning offenses,
      schism, and discord [which they are said to cause].
    </p>
    <p>
      But those who agree with the Pope, and defend his doctrine and [false]
      services, defile themselves with idolatry and blasphemous opinions, become
      guilty of the blood of the godly, whom the Pope [and his adherents]
      persecutes, detract from the glory of God, and hinder the welfare of the
      Church, because they strengthen errors and crimes to all posterity [in the
      sight of all the world and to the injury of all descendants].
    </p>
    <p>Of the Power and Jurisdiction of Bishops.</p>
    <p>
      [In our Confession and the Apology we have in general recounted what we
      have had to say concerning ecclesiastical power.] For the Gospel assigns
      to those who preside over churches the command to teach the Gospel to
      remit sins, to administer the Sacraments and besides jurisdiction, namely,
      the command to excommunicate those whose crimes are known, and again to
      absolve those who repent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by the confession of all, even of the adversaries, it is clear that
      this power by divine right is common to all who preside over churches,
      whether they are called pastors, or elders, or bishops. And accordingly
      Jerome openly teaches in the apostolic letters that all who preside over
      churches are both bishops and elders, and cites from Titus 1:5f : For this
      cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest ordain elders in every
      city [and afterwards calls these persons bishops]. Then he adds: A bishop
      must be the husband of one wife. Likewise Peter and John call themselves
      elders [or priests] 1 Pet. 5:1; 2 John 1. And he then adds: But that
      afterwards one was chosen to be placed over the rest, this was done as a
      remedy for schism, lest each one by attracting [a congregation here or
      there] to himself might rend the Church of Christ. For at Alexandria, from
      Mark the evangelist to the bishops Heracles and Dionysius, the elders
      always elected one from among themselves, and placed him in a higher
      station, whom they called bishop; just as an army would make a commander
      for itself. The deacons, moreover, may elect from among themselves one
      whom they know to be active, and name him archdeacon. For with the
      exception of ordination, what does the bishop that the elder does not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome, therefore, teaches that it is by human authority that the grades
      of bishop and elder or pastor are distinct. And the subject itself
      declares this, because the power [the office and command] is the same, as
      he has said above. But one matter afterwards made a distinction between
      bishops and pastors namely, ordination, because it was [so] arranged that
      one bishop should ordain ministers in a number of churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since by divine authority the grades of bishop and pastor are not
      diverse, it is manifest that ordination administered by a pastor in his
      own church is valid by divine law [if a pastor in his own church ordains
      certain suitable persons to the ministry, such ordination is, according to
      divine law, undoubtedly effective and right].
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, when the regular bishops become enemies of the Church, or are
      unwilling to administer ordination, the churches retain their own right.
      [Because the regular bishops persecute the Gospel and refuse to ordain
      suitable persons, every church has in this case full authority to ordain
      its own ministers.]
    </p>
    <p>
      For wherever the Church is, there is the authority [command] to administer
      the Gospel. Therefore it is necessary for the Church to retain the
      authority to call, elect, and ordain ministers. And this authority is a
      gift which in reality is given to the Church, which no human power can
      wrest from the Church, as Paul also testifies to the Ephesians when he
      says, Eph 4:8: He ascended, He gave gifts to men. And he enumerates among
      the gifts specially belonging to the Church pastors and teachers, and adds
      that such are given for the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
      Christ. Hence, wherever there is a true church, the right to elect and
      ordain ministers necessarily exists. Just as in a case of necessity even a
      layman absolves, and becomes the minister and pastor of another; as
      Augustine narrates the story of two Christians in a ship, one of whom
      baptized the catechumen, who after Baptism then absolved the baptizer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here belong the statements of Christ which testify that the keys have been
      given to the Church, and not merely to certain persons, Matt. 18:20: Where
      two or three are gathered together in My name, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the statement of Peter also confirms this, 1 Pet. 2:9: Ye are a
      royal priesthood. These words pertain to the true Church, which certainly
      has the right to elect and ordain ministers since it alone has the
      priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this also a most common custom of the Church testifies. For formerly
      the people elected pastors and bishops. Then came a bishop, either of that
      church or a neighboring one, who confirmed that one elected by the laying
      on of hands; and ordination was nothing else than such a ratification.
      Afterwards new ceremonies were added, many of which Dionysius describes.
      But he is a recent and fictitious author, whoever he may be [this book of
      Dionysius is a new fiction under a false title], just as the writings of
      Clement also are spurious [have a false title and have been manufactured
      by a wicked scoundrel long after Clement]. Then more modern writers added
      [that the bishop said to those whom he was ordaining]: I give thee the
      power to sacrifice for the living and the dead. But not even this is in
      Dionysius.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all these things it is clear that the Church retains the right to
      elect and ordain ministers. And the wickedness and tyranny of bishops
      afford cause for schism and discord [therefore, if the bishops either are
      heretics, or will not ordain suitable persons, the churches are in duty
      bound before God, according to divine law, to ordain for themselves
      pastors and ministers. Even though this be now called an irregularity or
      schism, it should be known that the godless doctrine and tyranny of the
      bishops is chargeable with it], because Paul, Gal. 1:7f , enjoins that
      bishops who teach and defend a godless doctrine and godless services
      should be regarded as accursed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of ordination, which alone, as Jerome says, distinguished
      bishops from other elders. Therefore there is need of no discussion
      concerning the other duties of bishops. Nor is it indeed necessary to
      speak of confirmation, nor of the consecration of bells [nor other
      tomfoolery of this kind], which are almost the only things which they have
      retained. Something must be said concerning jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that the common jurisdiction of excommunicating those guilty
      of manifest crimes belongs to all pastors. This they have tyrannically
      transferred to themselves alone, and have applied it to the acquisition of
      gain. For it is certain that the officials, as they are called employed a
      license not to be tolerated and either on account of avarice or because of
      other wanton desires tormented men and excommunicated them without any due
      process of law. But what tyranny is it for the officials in the states to
      have arbitrary power to condemn and excommunicate men without due process
      of law! And in what kind of affairs did they abuse this power? Indeed, not
      in punishing true offenses, but in regard to the violation of fasts or
      festivals, or like trifles! Only, they sometimes punished adulteries; and
      in this matter they often vexed [abused and defamed] innocent and
      honorable men. Besides, since this is a most grievous offense, nobody
      certainly is to be condemned without due process of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, therefore, bishops have tyrannically transferred this jurisdiction
      to themselves alone, and have basely abused it, there is no need, because
      of this jurisdiction, to obey bishops. But since there are just reasons
      why we do not obey, it is right also to restore this jurisdiction to godly
      pastors [to whom, by Christ&#x27;s command, it belongs], and to see to it
      that it is legitimately exercised for the reformation of morals and the
      glory of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains the jurisdiction in those cases which, according to
      canonical law, pertain to the ecclesiastical court, as they call it, and
      especially in cases of matrimony. This, too, the bishops have only by
      human right, and that, not a very old one, as appears from the Codex and
      Novellae of Justinian that decisions concerning marriage at that time
      belonged to the magistrates. And by divine right worldly magistrates are
      compelled to make these decisions if the bishops [judge unjustly or] are
      negligent. The canons also concede the same. Therefore, also on account of
      this jurisdiction it is not necessary to obey bishops. And, indeed, since
      they have framed certain unjust laws concerning marriages, and observe
      them in their courts, there is need also for this reason to establish
      other courts. For the traditions concerning spiritual relationship [the
      prohibition of marriage between sponsors] are unjust. Unjust also is the
      tradition which forbids an innocent person to marry after divorce. Unjust
      also is the law which in general approves all clandestine and underhanded
      betrothals in violation of the right of parents. Unjust also is the law
      concerning the celibacy of priests. There are also other snares of
      consciences in their laws, to recite all of which is of no profit. It is
      sufficient to have recited this, that there are many unjust laws of the
      Pope concerning matrimonial subjects on account of which the magistrates
      ought to establish other courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, therefore, the bishops, who are devoted to the Pope, defend godless
      doctrine and godless services, and do not ordain godly teachers, yea, aid
      the cruelty of the Pope, and, besides, have wrested the jurisdiction from
      pastors, and exercise it only tyrannically [for their own profit]; and
      lastly, since in matrimonial cases they observe many unjust laws, there
      are reasons sufficiently numerous and necessary why the churches should
      not recognize these as bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they themselves should remember that riches [estates and revenues]
      have been given to bishops as alms for the administration and advantage of
      the churches [that they may serve the Church, and perform their office the
      more efficiently], as the rule says: The benefice is given because of the
      office. Therefore they cannot with a good conscience possess these alms,
      and meanwhile defraud the Church, which has need of these means for
      supporting ministers, and aiding studies [educating learned men], and
      caring for the poor and establishing courts, especially matrimonial. For
      so great is the variety and extent of matrimonial controversies that there
      is need of a special tribunal for these, and for establishing this, the
      endowments of the Church are needed. Peter predicted, 2 Pet. 2:13, that
      there would be godless bishops, who would abuse the alms of the Church for
      luxury and neglect the ministry. Therefore [since the Holy Spirit in that
      connection utters dire threats] let those who defraud the Church know that
      they will pay God the penalty for this crime.

      Imperial Majesty. I have also read the Formula of Concord concerning the
      Sacrament, made at Wittenberg with Dr. Bucer and others. I have also read
      the articles written at the Assembly at Smalcald in the German language by
      Dr. Martin Luther, our most revered preceptor, and the tract concerning
      the Papacy and the Power and Jurisdiction of Bishops. And in my humble
      opinion I judge that all these agree with Holy Scripture, and with the
      belief of the true and genuine catholic Church. But although in so great a
      number of most learned men who have now assembled at Smalcald I
      acknowledge that I am of all the least yet, as I am not permitted to await
      the end of the assembly, I ask you, most renowned man, Dr. John
      Bugenhagen, most revered Father in Christ, that your courtesy may add my
      name, if it be necessary, to all that I have above mentioned. For I
      testify in this my own handwriting that I thus hold, confess, and
      constantly will teach, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
