        <h2>Defition</h2>
        <p>
          Defined as the exploration of &quot;what is real,&quot; metaphysics
          delves into fundamental questions about being, existence, and the
          nature of reality. It seeks answers to fundamental questions like,
          "What is real?" or "What is the nature of existence?" This pursuit,
          far from mere intellectual indulgence, is a crucial step in aligning
          our understanding of the universe with the revelation of God in
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          Biblical truths offer a framework for tackling complex metaphysical
          questions. Is reality a single substance or composed of multiple
          elements? How do things change over time? What is the relationship
          between our minds and the physical world? Exploring these questions
          through the lens of Scripture enriches our understanding of God,
          ourselves, and the universe.
        </p>
        <h2>God</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike the universe, which requires an explanation for its existence,
          God is self-existent, the &quot;unmoved mover&quot; who initiated all
          being. He stands outside the causal chain, the ultimate source of all
          reality. God is boundless in space and time, unconfined by the
          limitations of the physical universe. He is present everywhere yet
          distinct from all things, a being beyond human comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible reveals one God existing in three distinct persons: Father,
          Son, and Holy Spirit. This profound truth shapes our understanding of
          relationship, love, and the very fabric of reality. God is not an
          impersonal force or abstract principle. He is a personal being with
          intellect, will, and emotions, engaging with his creation in a loving
          and purposeful way. His character is eternally unchanging, a source of
          stability and truth in a world of flux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything we see and experience owes its existence to God&#x27;s
          sovereign will. This underscores our dependence on him and his
          absolute authority over all things. He reigns over all things, past,
          present, and future. His sovereignty guides history, fulfilling his
          purposes for creation and providing a framework for understanding
          human agency and free will. His perfect goodness, love, and holiness
          stand in stark contrast to competing philosophies that see the
          universe as inherently flawed, random, or governed by opposing forces.
        </p>
        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p>
          Creation occurred not from pre-existing matter, but from nothing.
          God&#x27;s Word brought forth the universe, demonstrating his power
          over all things. Creation is not a haphazard accident, but a
          manifestation of God's wisdom and intentionality. Every detail, from
          the vast galaxies to the intricate complexity of a living cell,
          reflects his purposeful design. God does not abandon his creation
          after bringing it into existence. He continuously sustains and
          interacts with the universe, upholding its laws and guiding its course
          through his providence.
