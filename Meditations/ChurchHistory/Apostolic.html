        <h2>The Apostolic Period (30-140 AD)</h2>
        <p>
          This period of church history begins at Pentecost when the Apostles
          went out preaching and ends when the Christian leaders that directly
          interacted with the Apostles died. The New Testament accurately and
          authoritatively records the founding of the church and how it
          developed in the first century. Early Christian theologians known as
          the Apostolic Fathers show us how the church continued on after the
          Apostles.
        </p>
        <h1>Timeline</h1>
        <p>
          C. 30-33 AD: Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This event
          marks the foundation of the Christian faith and is followed by the
          Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 34-37 AD: Conversion of Saul of Tarsus. Saul, later known as Paul
          the Apostle, was pivotal to the spread of Christianity among Gentiles
          and authored 13 New Testament letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 37-41 AD: James leads the Jerusalem Church. James, the brother of
          Jesus, becomes a prominent leader in the Jerusalem church, as depicted
          in the Acts of the Apostles and other historical sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 40-60 AD: Period of Pauline missions. The Apostle Paul undertakes
          several missionary journeys across the Roman Empire, establishing
          churches and writing letters to these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 48-49 AD: The incident at Antioch. Paul confronts Peter over the
          issue of Gentile Christians following Jewish customs.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 48-50 AD: Council of Jerusalem. Early church leaders, including
          Peter and James, got together to discuss Gentile conversion and
          Christian practice.
        </p>
        <p>C. 51-52 AD: Paul appears before the Proconsul Gallio in Corinth.</p>
        <p>
          C. 64-67 AD: Nero&#x27;s persecution of Christians. Following the
          Great Fire, Christians are blamed and persecuted, marking the first
          major Roman persecution. The Apostles Paul and Peter are put to death
          under Emperor Nero.
        </p>
        <p>
          C. 50-70 AD: Composition of the Synoptic Gospels. Matthew, Mark, and
          Luke are written during this period as well as several other New
          Testament texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          70 AD: Destruction of the Temple. The Second Temple in Jerusalem was
          destroyed by the Roman general Titus. This event, foretold by Jesus in
          detail, had a profound impact on both Judaism and the early Christian
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>

          C. 95-150 AD: Writings of the Apostolic Fathers. Clement of Rome,
          Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp of Smyrna write letters and texts
          that provide insights into early Christian theology, governance, and
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>

          Emperor Hadrian.
        </p>
        <p>
          132-136 AD: The Bar-Kokhba Jewish Insurrection against Hadrian takes
          place.
        </p>
        <h1>New Testament</h1>
        <h2>Foundation for the Church</h2>
        <p>
          The origins of the Church are intricately linked to the life and
          teachings of Jesus Christ. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
          John, show how Jesus' ministry laid the foundation for the Church. His
          teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection are central to Christian
          faith and were foundational for the establishment and growth of the
          early Church.
        </p>
        <h2>Pentecost: Official Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          The book of Acts, authored by Luke, offers a detailed account of the
          Church's inception, particularly at Pentecost. After Jesus' ascension,
          his disciples received the Holy Spirit, as described in Acts 2. This
          event is often considered the official birth of the Church. The
          disciples, filled with the Holy Spirit, began preaching the gospel,
          marking the start of the Christian mission.
        </p>
        <h2>The Apostles</h2>
        <p>
          Central in the early Church were the Apostles, particularly Peter and
          Paul. Peter played a crucial role in establishing communities of
          believers, as seen in various parts of Acts. Paul, once a persecutor
          of Christians, experienced a dramatic conversion and became a key
          missionary, spreading Christianity beyond Jewish communities to
          Gentiles, as extensively documented in his epistles.
        </p>
        <h2>Spread of Christianity</h2>
        <p>
          Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire. Despite
          persecution and challenges, the message of Jesus found a receptive
          audience across diverse cultures and social classes. The Epistles,
          letters written by Paul and other leaders to various Christian
          communities, record the theological foundations and practical
          challenges of the early Church.
        </p>
        <h1>Apostolic Fathers</h1>
        <p>
          The Apostolic Fathers are a group of early Christian theologians who
          are believed to have had direct or close contact with the Apostles of
          Jesus Christ. Their writings, composed in the late 1st and early 2nd
          centuries, are among the earliest extant Christian documents outside
          the New Testament. While the works of the Apostolic Fathers are
          instructive and beneficial for understanding the development of
          Christian doctrine, practice, and history, they should not supersede
          or be equated with scriptural authority.
        </p>
        <h2>Clement of Rome</h2>
        <p>
          Clement of Rome is also known as Pope Clement I. The term "pope," as
          it is understood today, did not exist in the first century. The
          structure and authority of the early Christian church were more
          decentralized, and the concept of a single supreme pontiff as the head
          of the church was a later development. The title "pope" (from Latin
          "papa," meaning father) became more distinctly associated with the
          bishop of Rome several centuries later. Clement is said to have served
          as bishop from around 88 AD until his death in 99 AD. These dates,
          however, are not certain and vary among sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The First Epistle of Clement, or 1 Clement, is traditionally ascribed
          to Clement of Rome and was likely written around 96 AD. It is
          addressed to the Christian church in Corinth and is one of the oldest
          pieces of extant Christian writings outside the New Testament. This
          letter was written from the body of Christ followers in Rome to those
          in Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Second Epistle of Clement, or 2 Clement, was traditionally
          believed to have been an epistle written by Clement of Rome to the
          Christian Church in Corinth in the late first century. However,
          4th-century bishop Eusebius expressed doubt about the authenticity of
          this second epistle, and it is now widely accepted that 2 Clement was
          not written by Clement of Rome but by an anonymous author. Moreover, 2
          Clement is considered to be not a letter but an early Christian homily
          or sermon, and it focuses on different themes such as almsgiving and
          church wealth distribution, distinct from the issues of church
          leadership and schism addressed in 1 Clement. This text was probably
          composed around AD 150.
        </p>

        <h2>Ignatius of Antioch</h2>
        <p>
          Ignatius of Antioch lived between around 50 AD and 110-140 AD and is
          known for his letters before his martyrdom in Rome during the reign of
          Emperor Trajan. These letters were written during his transport to
          Rome as a prisoner, where he was condemned to die for his beliefs.
          Ignatius is believed to have been a disciple of the Apostle John.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the late 20th century, scholarly consensus largely accepted the
          authenticity of seven original epistles, although some debate
          continues. Ignatius is believed to have written epistles to the
          Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans,
          and to Polycarp.
        </p>

        <h2>Polycarp of Smyrna</h2>
        <p>
          Polycarp of Smyrna (AD 69-155) was a Christian bishop of Smyrna. He is
          celebrated for his martyrdom where he was bound and burned at the
          stake, and then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body.
          Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians is the only surviving work
          definitively attributed to Polycarp. The letter is an exhortation to
          the Philippians to maintain faith and righteousness, and it echoes the
          teachings and scriptural interpretations of the early Church.
        </p>

        <h2>Papias of Hierapolis</h2>
        <p>
          Papias of Hierapolis (AD 60-130) was an early Christian author and the
          Bishop of Hierapolis, a Phrygian city. Eusebius of Caesarea, a
          4th-century bishop and historian, and Irenaeus of Lyons, a 2nd-century
          theologian, provide the primary historical accounts of Papias.
          Irenaeus described Papias as "a hearer of John and a companion of
          Polycarp," while Eusebius was more critical, questioning Papias's
          intelligence due to his chiliastic views.
        </p>
        <p>
          His main work, Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord, is known only
          through fragments preserved in later writings. Papias's work is
          significant for its early accounts of the authorship of the Gospels.
          He provides the earliest extant account of who wrote the Gospels of
          Mark and Matthew, with Mark's Gospel being depicted as a compilation
          of Peter's recollections and Matthew's as a collection of Jesus's
          sayings originally penned in Hebrew or Aramaic.
        </p>

        <h2>Quadratus of Athens</h2>
        <p>
          Quadratus of Athens (died c. AD 129) was one of the first Christian
          apologists, renowned for presenting an apologetic discourse to Emperor
          Hadrian around 124-125 AD during Hadrian's visit to Athens. The period
          of his life is sometimes confused, with some sources incorrectly
          associating him with the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161–180) rather
          than Hadrian (117–138).
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of Quadratus's writings have been lost, but he is acknowledged
          for his argument for Christ’s deity, which was a direct response to
          challenges Christians faced during that time. He is mentioned in the
          writings of early church historians like Eusebius and Jerome, who
          provided insights into his life and work.
        </p>

        <h2>The Epistle to Diognetus</h2>
        <p>
          The Epistle to Diognetus is a distinguished work of Christian
          apologetics from the early Christian period. There is also scholarly
          debate regarding the authorship of the 'Epistle to Diognetus.' It was
          initially attributed to Justin Martyr, but later some suggested that
          it could be the work of Quadratus. The last two chapters often
          considered later additions from the 3rd century, possibly written by
          Hippolytus or Pantaenus. Ultimately its authorship and provenance
          remain unknown. It is considered one of the earliest examples of
          apologetic literature, with estimates of its dating being as early as
          AD 130, which would make it contemporaneous with figures such as
          Melito of Sardis, Athenagoras of Athens, and Tatian.
        </p>
        <p>
          The epistle is attributed to an author identified only as Mathetes, a
          Greek term meaning "student" or "disciple," and not a proper name. The
          content of the epistle suggests that the author was a Johannine
          Christian, one who particularly emphasized the concept of the Logos.
          This epistle is known for defending the doctrines and practices of
          Christianity against the critiques of the time, addressing questions
          about the nature of God and the Christians' disregard for worldly
          concerns and death.
        </p>

        <h2>The Didache</h2>
        <p>
          The Didache is considered to be from the early second century. The
          authorship and the precise origin of the Didache remain unknown, but
          it is thought to be the oldest patristic document, probably
          originating from Syria, although some suggest Egypt as a possible
          source.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text is a composite work with various sections, including the "Two
          Ways" of life and death (chapters 1-6), a liturgical manual (chapters
          7-10), instructions on the reception of traveling prophets (chapters
          11-15), and a brief apocalypse (chapter 16).
        </p>

        <h2>The Epistle of Barnabas</h2>
        <p>
          The Epistle of Barnabas is an early Christian text, composed in Greek
          between AD 70 and 132. This epistle is distinct from the
          pseudepigraphical Gospel of Barnabas and is sometimes referred to as
          Pseudo-Barnabas due to uncertainties regarding its authorship. Some
          speculate that the writer was an Alexandrian Jew from the times of the
          Roman Emperors Trajan and Hadrian. He might have been a layman who was
          mistakenly associated with the apostolic figure of Barnabas due to
          sharing the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The epistle employs the term "gnosis," or knowledge, and tackles how
          the “Old Testament” should be interpreted in contrast to Jewish
          interpretations, as well as how Christians should define themselves in
          relation to non-Christian Jews. It argues that the Law's teachings
          were not meant to be followed literally. It also argues that God's
          covenant was for all people, not exclusively with the Jews, and refers
          to practices such as circumcision as "the work of the devil."
        </p>

        <h2>The Shepherd of Hermas</h2>
        <p>
          The Shepherd of Hermas was composed in Rome in the early 2nd century
          and attached to the Codex Sinaiticus, a major fourth-century
          manuscript. Its influence is evident in the many languages it was
          translated into: Latin, Ethiopic, Coptic, Middle Persian, and
          Georgian. Its quasi-canonical status was debated, with some church
          fathers valuing its teachings while others, like Athanasius and
          Jerome, placed it outside the canon or were unaware of it. Hermas, the
          author, is only known through autobiographical details in the
          Shepherd. He was a former enslaved Christian who gained freedom,
          became a wealthy merchant, lost his wealth, and did penance for past
          sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shepherd is divided into three sections: five visions, twelve
          moral commandments, and ten parables. The initial visions portray the
          Church as an elderly matron who becomes progressively younger,
          symbolizing renewal through repentance. Hermas is shown a vision of a
          tower representing the Church, with different stones symbolizing
          various Christians. A prominent aspect of the Shepherd is its focus on
          penance and forgiveness for post-baptismal sin, a significant topic of
          debate in early Christian communities.
