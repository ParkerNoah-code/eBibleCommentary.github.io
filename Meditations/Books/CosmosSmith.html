        <h2>Objective of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Smith makes an important distinction between scientific knowledge,
          that which is observable and emperically verifiable, and scientistic
          belief, that which is presupposed in science and not subject to
          scientific analysis. Scientific knowledge can be rigorously verified
          through the scientific method. It relies on tangible evidence and is
          continually subject to scrutiny and validation. In contrast,
          scientistic beliefs are not able to be empirically verified, but form
          the philosophical underpinnings of scientific endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, he seeks to demonstrate that many of the metaphysical
          scientistic tenets upon which science rests are volatile and
          groundless. Looking at the fields of cosmology, evolution, and
          psychology, Smith traces the origin of the scientistic unconscious
          that has formed an unfounded, dogmatic confidence in science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, having revealed the limitations of emperical science and
          scientistic belief, he considers the metaphysical concept of
          transcendence, thus "breaking through the barrier of scientistic
          belief." In presenting this idea of transcendence, he gives an
          enlarged picture of the universe and of what lies beyond it.

        <h1>The Physical Universe</h1>
        <h2>Metaphysical Bifurcation</h2>
        <p>
          Typical explanations of what the physical universe is made of include
          space, time, and matter, or matter and energy, or something more
          complicated and inconceivable.<sup>1</sup> But all of these
          explanations share in common that the universe is conceived of in an
          abstract mathematical way. Light is electromagnetic radiation with a
          certain range of wavelengths. Sound is a pressure wave created by
          vibration. Odor is a mixture of tiny chemical particles released into
          the air. Thoughts are patterns of neurons firing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This physical picture of the universe cuts out nearly everything
          involved in the human point of view. The outside world and our
          perceptions of that outside world become completely seperate, distinct
          things.<sup>2</sup> This bifurcation into primary qualities, the
          noumenal, and secondary qualities, the phenomenal, is at the heart of
          science. Primary qualities such as size, shape, and position are seen
          as those things which are real about the object. Secondary qualities
          like color, taste, and smell then are mere products of the mind, and
          the mind is reduced to the primary qualities of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of this position is that everything is reduced to an
          abstraction. No longer do we have a universe because all that's left
          is a model, and we've mistaken the model to be all that there is.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the first known to give an argument for a
          version of the primary/secondary quality distinction, uses many
          examples like the oar in the water to argue that the various
          appearances of a body are inessential while the primary affections
          like size, shape, and number are essential to bodies.<sup>3</sup>
          Likewise, René Descartes (1596-1650) distinguishes between sensible
          qualities and material bodies.<sup>4</sup> This is seen clearly in his
          ideas that the mind and body are distinct, independent substances and
          that matter and motion can explain everything in the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This set the stage for Isaac Newton (1642-1727) to popularize a
          philosophy of Cartesian metaphysics and extreme empiricism.<sup
            >5</sup
          >
          This primarily took place through the <em>Principia</em> which was
          seen as the exemplar of scientific achievement.<sup>6</sup> By the end
          of the 19th century, Newtonian physics appeared unassailable, and his
          philosophy followed uncritically with all the authority that his
          physics did. Despite this significant achievement, certain insoluble
          difficulties remained. It wouldn't be long before a paradigm shift
          took place in physics with the advent of the special theory of
          relativity of Albert Einstein (1879-1955).<sup>7</sup>
          Despite this theoretical shift away from Newtonian physics, Newton's
          questionable metaphysical bifurcation still loomed large.
        </p>
        <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Physicists in the early 20th century began to reassess the foundations
          of Newtonian physics. This reevaluation revealed that Newtonian
          physics was not dealing with absolute entities that exist
          independently of observation. Instead, it focused on what could be
          observed, marking a significant shift in the understanding of the
          physical world.<sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics is built on the foundations of Heisenberg's
          uncertainty principle.<sup>9</sup> The uncertainty principle, a key
          element of quantum mechanics, imposes strict limits on our ability to
          simultaneously know certain pairs of properties, such as an object's
          position and momentum. This limitation underscores the intrinsic
          subjectivity of quantum physics, as it implies that our knowledge of
          the physical world is inherently statistical and uncertain. Thus the
          wave-function in quantum mechanics represents a system but doesn't
          describe the system itself; rather, it embodies our knowledge of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics also introduced the concept of wave-particle
          dualism.<sup>10</sup> This means that particles, such as electrons,
          can behave both as discrete particles and as continuous waves
          depending on the experimental context. This challenges classical ideas
          of distinct, solid particles. This wave-particle dualism defies
          classical determinism and highlights the inherent complexity of the
          physical world.<sup>11</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The scientific depiction of the universe as primarily a configuration
          of matter, energy, space, and time, stripped of human-centric
          qualities, presents a profound metaphysical riff in reality. This
          division relegates the experience of humans to mere secondary
          phenomena, products of the mind's interaction with a fundamentally
          impersonal world. While this perspective has driven vast scientific
          progress, it inevitably renders the cosmos an abstraction—a model
          devoid of the qualitative aspects that comprise the entirety of human
          perception. Thus, science, in its quest for objectivity, leaves no
          room for the very subjects doing the science and leaves a mechanistic
          universe that may be quantifiable, but is unrecognisable to the beings
          trying to understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The history from Galileo to Einstein reveals a trajectory of thought
          that progressively abstracted the universe into mathematical laws and
          principles. This underscores a certain philosophical undercurrent
          wherein the sensory qualities experienced by humans are systematically
          divorced from the 'real' qualities inherent in the physical world
          itself. Galileo's primary qualities, Descartes' dualism, and Newton's
          empirical framework set the stage for a world-view heavily predicated
          on quantifiable phenomena at the expense of the qualitative aspects of
          existence. As such, the achievements of classical physics, while
          significant, left unresolved tensions and gaps that only began to
          surface with the seismic shifts brought about by Einstein and the
          quantum revolution; however, the basic philosophical assumptions still
          remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uncertainty principle and the concept of wave-particle duality
          introduce challenges to the clear-cut distinctions of classical
          physics. In this light, reality is no longer a static entity to be
          dissected into primary and secondary qualities, but a dynamic and
          partly unknowable interaction that resists full comprehension through
          traditional scientific means. As quantum mechanics reveals the
          limitations of deterministic laws and the crucial role of the
          observer, it invites a broader philosophical view of the nature of
          reality.
