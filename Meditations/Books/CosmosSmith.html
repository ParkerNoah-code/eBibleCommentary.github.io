        <h2>Objective of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Smith makes an important distinction between scientific knowledge,
          that which is observable and emperically verifiable, and scientistic
          belief, that which is presupposed in science and not subject to
          scientific analysis. Scientific knowledge can be rigorously verified
          through the scientific method. It relies on tangible evidence and is
          continually subject to scrutiny and validation. In contrast,
          scientistic beliefs are not able to be empirically verified, but form
          the philosophical underpinnings of scientific endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, he seeks to demonstrate that many of the metaphysical
          scientistic tenets upon which science rests are volatile and
          groundless. Looking at the fields of cosmology, evolution, and
          psychology, Smith traces the origin of the scientistic unconscious
          that has formed an unfounded, dogmatic confidence in science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, having revealed the limitations of emperical science and
          scientistic belief, he considers the metaphysical concept of
          transcendence, thus "breaking through the barrier of scientistic
          belief." In presenting this idea of transcendence, he gives an
          enlarged picture of the universe and of what lies beyond it.
        </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          I use Smith's distinction between scientific knowledge and scientistic
          belief as a springboard for my own analysis. I also follow the general
          outline of the book for my own research so that Smith's book can be
          easily referenced on any topic. I also provide extensive footnotes for
          further research.

        <h1>The Physical Universe</h1>
        <h2>Metaphysical Bifurcation</h2>
        <p>
          Typical explanations of what the physical universe is made of include
          space, time, and matter, or matter and energy, or something more
          complicated and inconceivable.<sup>1</sup> But all of these
          explanations share in common that the universe is conceived of in an
          abstract mathematical way. Light is electromagnetic radiation with a
          certain range of wavelengths. Sound is a pressure wave created by
          vibration. Odor is a mixture of tiny chemical particles released into
          the air. Thoughts are patterns of neurons firing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This physical picture of the universe cuts out nearly everything
          involved in the human point of view. The outside world and our
          perceptions of that outside world become completely seperate, distinct
          things.<sup>2</sup> This bifurcation into primary qualities, the
          noumenal, and secondary qualities, the phenomenal, is at the heart of
          science. Primary qualities such as size, shape, and position are seen
          as those things which are real about the object. Secondary qualities
          like color, taste, and smell then are mere products of the mind, and
          the mind is reduced to the primary qualities of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of this position is that everything is reduced to an
          abstraction. No longer do we have a universe because all that's left
          is a model, and we've mistaken the model to be all that there is.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the first known to give an argument for a
          version of the primary/secondary quality distinction, uses many
          examples like the oar in the water to argue that the various
          appearances of a body are inessential while the primary affections
          like size, shape, and number are essential to bodies.<sup>3</sup>
          Likewise, René Descartes (1596-1650) distinguishes between sensible
          qualities and material bodies.<sup>4</sup> This is seen clearly in his
          ideas that the mind and body are distinct, independent substances and
          that matter and motion can explain everything in the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This set the stage for Isaac Newton (1642-1727) to popularize a
          philosophy of Cartesian metaphysics and extreme empiricism.<sup
            >5</sup
          >
          This primarily took place through the <em>Principia</em> which was
          seen as the exemplar of scientific achievement.<sup>6</sup> By the end
          of the 19th century, Newtonian physics appeared unassailable, and his
          philosophy followed uncritically with all the authority that his
          physics did. Despite this significant achievement, certain insoluble
          difficulties remained. It wouldn't be long before a paradigm shift
          took place in physics with the advent of the special theory of
          relativity of Albert Einstein (1879-1955).<sup>7</sup>
          Despite this theoretical shift away from Newtonian physics, Newton's
          questionable metaphysical bifurcation still loomed large.
        </p>
        <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Physicists in the early 20th century began to reassess the foundations
          of Newtonian physics. This reevaluation revealed that Newtonian
          physics was not dealing with absolute entities that exist
          independently of observation. Instead, it focused on what could be
          observed, marking a significant shift in the understanding of the
          physical world.<sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics is built on the foundations of Heisenberg's
          uncertainty principle.<sup>9</sup> The uncertainty principle, a key
          element of quantum mechanics, imposes strict limits on our ability to
          simultaneously know certain pairs of properties, such as an object's
          position and momentum.<sup>10</sup> This limitation underscores the
          intrinsic subjectivity of quantum physics, as it implies that our
          knowledge of the physical world is inherently statistical and
          uncertain. Thus the wave-function in quantum mechanics represents a
          system but doesn't describe the system itself; rather, it embodies our
          knowledge of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics also introduced the concept of wave-particle
          dualism.<sup>11</sup> This means that particles, such as electrons,
          can behave both as discrete particles and as continuous waves
          depending on the experimental context. This challenges classical ideas
          of distinct, solid particles. This wave-particle dualism defies
          classical determinism and highlights the inherent complexity of the
          physical world.<sup>12</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The scientific depiction of the universe as primarily a configuration
          of matter, energy, space, and time, stripped of human-centric
          qualities, presents a profound metaphysical riff in reality. This
          division relegates the experience of humans to mere secondary
          phenomena, products of the mind's interaction with a fundamentally
          impersonal world. While this perspective has driven vast scientific
          progress, it inevitably renders the cosmos an abstraction—a model
          devoid of the qualitative aspects that comprise the entirety of human
          perception. Thus, science, in its quest for objectivity, leaves the
          universe unrecognisable to the beings trying to understand it because
          of its fundamental philosophical assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The history from Galileo to Einstein reveals a trajectory of thought
          that progressively abstracted the universe into mathematical laws and
          principles. This underscores a certain philosophical undercurrent
          wherein the sensory qualities experienced by humans are systematically
          divorced from the 'real' qualities inherent in the physical world
          itself. Galileo's primary qualities, Descartes' dualism, and Newton's
          empirical framework set the stage for a world-view heavily predicated
          on quantifiable phenomena at the expense of the qualitative aspects of
          existence. As such, the achievements of classical physics, while
          significant, left unresolved tensions and gaps that only began to
          surface with the seismic shifts brought about by Einstein and the
          quantum revolution; however, the basic philosophical difficulties
          still remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uncertainty principle and the concept of wave-particle duality
          introduce challenges to the clear-cut distinctions of classical
          physics. In this light, reality is no longer a static entity to be
          dissected into primary and secondary qualities, but a dynamic and
          partly unknowable interaction that resists full comprehension through
          traditional scientific means. Quantum mechanics thus reveals the
          limitations of deterministic laws and the crucial role of the
          observer.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three considerations demonstrate that science rests on certain
          philosophical principles that are not self evidentally true. Its
          presuppositions can be tested on philosophical grounds. We will
          proceed by first examining which scientistic beliefs can be supported
          or discredited and then look at what philosophical account can best
          explain the scientific data.

          uncertainty in position and the number of waves. (4) Momentum is
          related to wavelength.

        <h1>The Cartesian Dilemma</h1>
        <h2>Scientific Dualism</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of scientific dualism, emerging in the 16th and 17th
          centuries, is rooted in the resurgence of Platonic thought,
          significantly influenced by Renaissance figures such as Marsilio
          Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. This revival emphasized numerical and
          harmonic principles, impacting notable thinkers like Nicolaus
          Copernicus during his studies in Bologna. Copernicus&#x27;s
          astronomical theories, pivotal in the evolution of modern physics,
          underscored a growing conviction in the era that mathematics was the
          foundation of true knowledge. This view was shared by Kepler, who
          posited that the human mind was inherently designed to comprehend the
          universe in quantitative terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift represented a departure from medieval scholasticism, paving
          the way for groundbreaking discoveries in the Newtonian era. However,
          Kepler&#x27;s work remained imbued with Platonic transcendentalism, as
          he focused on celestial harmony and eternal laws governing the solar
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scientific paradigm further evolved with Galileo, who shifted
          focus from celestial to terrestrial phenomena. Upholding the
          significance of mathematics, Galileo diverged from the Platonic ideal
          by applying mathematical principles to earthly phenomena, like the
          motion of falling objects. The European fascination with mechanical
          devices, such as astronomical clocks, likely fueled the concept of the
          universe as a vast, intricate mechanism—a notion that became central
          to the European intellectual landscape and significantly influenced
          scientific thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Galileo contributed to the concept of a divided reality, interpreting
          secondary qualities subjectively. However, it was René Descartes who
          fully crystallized this new vision. As a mathematician, physicist, and
          philosopher, Descartes pursued a mechanical science grounded in
          mathematical principles to explain natural phenomena, ranging from
          planetary movements to animal motion. He contended that only a
          mechanical universe could be understood in mechanical terms, arguing
          against the notion that physical attributes like size, shape, and
          motion could produce entirely different qualities, as some
          philosophers of his time believed. This approach marked a decisive
          turn in scientific thought, emphasizing a dualism between mind and
          matter and laying the groundwork for modern scientific inquiry.
        </p>
        <h2>Descartes</h2>
        <p>
          Descartes&#x27; philosophical contributions, particularly in the realm
          of mind-body dualism, profoundly influenced the development of modern
          science and philosophy. He challenged the traditional notions of
          substantial forms and real qualities, which many philosophers believed
          inherently existed in objects. Descartes argued that these secondary
          qualities, such as color and sound, could not be explained
          mechanically, leading to his famous distinction between res cogitans
          (thinking substance) and res extensa (extended substance). This
          distinction underpins Cartesian dualism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Descartes posited that the universe must be fundamentally mechanical
          to be understood in mechanical terms. He envisioned the universe as
          composed entirely of matter (res extensa), operating in space
          according to mechanical laws. In contrast, everything else, including
          thought and consciousness, belonged to a different realm of existence
          (res cogitans). He famously arrived at the certainty of res cogitans
          with his cogito ergo sum (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;),
          considering it the only immediate certainty. The existence of a
          mechanical universe outside of res cogitans was later deduced through
          logical arguments involving the concept of God and His truthfulness.
          This foundational premise of modern materialism ironically relied on
          theological principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Descartes faced significant challenges in explaining the
          interaction between the non-physical res cogitans and the physical res
          extensa. The problem lay in reconciling how the mind (a non-physical
          entity) could interact with the body (a physical entity), especially
          in contexts like sense perception and voluntary action. While
          mechanical causes couldn&#x27;t produce substantial forms and real
          qualities in objects, Descartes struggled to coherently explain how
          res cogitans and res extensa could interact. He sometimes resorted to
          theological arguments, which were not universally convincing, and at
          other times, he confidently asserted that physical processes alone
          could produce all sensations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, Descartes&#x27; philosophical framework
          significantly influenced his successors, including Newton. Scientists
          began to emphasize res extensa, accepting it as an absolute truth
          while largely disregarding Descartes&#x27; arguments for the existence
          of res cogitans. Over time, the concept of res cogitans, initially
          considered an unextended substance, was first localized to a specific
          brain area in Newton&#x27;s theories (the Newtonian sensorium) and
          eventually marginalized or discarded in scientific discourse. This
          evolution marked a significant shift in Cartesian logic, with res
          extensa becoming more prominent than res cogitans, almost as though
          the hypothesis had overtaken the original concept. This transformation
          laid the groundwork for the materialistic view of the universe that
          came to dominate scientific thought.
        </p>
        <h2>Mechanical Universe</h2>
        <p>
          As the 17th century came to an end, the concept of a mechanical
          universe was increasingly accepted as the prevailing scientific
          theory. Most, except a few discerning philosophers, regarded every
          success in physics as further proof of this Newtonian perspective.
          Scientists, more focused on expanding their analytical knowledge than
          examining its underlying principles, did not challenge this view. This
          was a time marked by extraordinary optimism.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some intellectual mavericks resisted this trend. In 1710,
          George Berkeley, a dynamic Irish thinker, raised compelling objections
          against the Cartesian idea of a universe that exists without being
          perceived. He argued that the existence of things like the table he
          wrote on depended on their perception. To Berkeley, the essence of the
          universe lay in its perception, not in an isolated mechanistic
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          This debate shifted in 1781 to the German town of Konigsberg, where
          Immanuel Kant published his critical work, &quot;Critique of Pure
          Reason.&quot; Like Descartes, Kant aimed to solidify the theoretical
          foundation of mechanics. He realized that a fundamental problem in
          philosophy was the separation between the scientist and the objects of
          study. Kant&#x27;s approach was to conceptually bring these objects
          closer to the observer. He argued that space, as perceived by us, is
          not derived from external experiences but is a precondition for
          experiencing the external world. According to Kant, space and time are
          not properties of things in themselves but forms imposed by our
          intuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kant&#x27;s analysis extended to time, which he described as the
          &#x27;pure form of inner intuition.&#x27; He concluded that our
          understanding of space and time, and the objects within them, is
          shaped by our perception and that the true nature of objects,
          independent of our perception, is unknown to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kant&#x27;s revolutionary ideas dramatically changed the philosophical
          landscape, offering a new perspective that potentially resolved the
          bifurcation dilemma and provided a foundation for scientific
          knowledge. His insights were particularly relevant to modern physics,
          emphasizing the relationship between nature and our perception of it.
          Though the scientific community may not have directly engaged with
          Kant&#x27;s philosophy, his critique of Newtonian principles
          significantly influenced 20th-century physics and European philosophy.
          His work, just like Hume&#x27;s influence on him, awakened subsequent
          generations of thinkers to new philosophical possibilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Critiques</h2>
        <p>
          Despite rigorous critiques, Cartesianism&#x27;s influence persisted
          into the early 20th century, with major Western philosophical schools
          still burdened by a key Cartesian bias. Even critics like Berkeley and
          Kant, in their efforts to challenge Descartes, inadvertently adopted
          his fundamental assumption. For centuries, this deep-rooted idea
          exerted a strong influence on European philosophy, with few
          philosophers managing to break free from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This central Cartesian belief posits that the true object of sense
          perception is confined within the human mind. It suggests that
          perception doesn’t extend beyond immediate sense data or mental
          constructs derived from them. This assumption leads to the notion that
          the external world, if it exists, is conjectural and inaccessible. In
          this view, the external world becomes a thing-in-itself, either
          doubtful as per Descartes or outright denied as per Berkeley.
          Consequently, the familiar world of everyday human experience is
          deemed subjective and somewhat illusory, essentially a personal
          fantasy, as Berkeley noted with his principle of
          <em>esse is percipi</em>, to be is to be perceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once this Cartesian premise is accepted, the concept of bifurcation
          becomes feasible. One can then imagine an external universe devoid of
          anything but mechanical properties, dismissing the obvious objection
          that the real world doesn’t match this description. The objective
          world turns into an enigma to be unraveled by philosophers and
          scientists. However, the more one probes, the more insurmountable the
          divide between the external realm and its subjective representations
          seems. Berkeley&#x27;s denial of the external world&#x27;s existence
          is based on this Cartesian foundation, arguing that if perception ends
          in a mental image, the idea of an external universe is inherently
          contradictory. Even Kant&#x27;s philosophical revolution couldn&#x27;t
          bridge this gap, leaving the external world as an ultimate, unknowable
          entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t until the 20th century that serious philosophical criticism
          began to challenge the Cartesian premise. Philosophers increasingly
          recognized that the true object of perception is not merely a mental
          image. Perception involves both passive reception (the datum) and
          active understanding (the intentional object). While this process may
          involve mental representations, what is perceived is the intentional
          object itself. To assume this object is merely a subjective
          representation or appearance is to fall back into the Cartesian trap.
          For instance, the three-dimensional nature of visual perception
          suggests that the object perceived isn&#x27;t just a visual image. To
          insist that it must be a subjective representation is an unwarranted
          assumption, implying that the soul has no windows and, ultimately,
          questioning the possibility of objective knowledge altogether.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond the Kantian Riff</h2>
        <p>
          These remarks about perception and intentionality are meant to
          initiate a discussion, not conclude it. The issue is complex and
          significant, and has been the focus of intense study by leading
          philosophers, starting with Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Husserl, originally a mathematician, delved into philosophy by
          analyzing logical concepts fundamental to mathematics. He robustly
          defended the objectivity of these logical entities against subjective
          doubts, suggesting he had identified the transcendence of certain
          intentional acts. Husserl later expanded his research to other forms
          of intentionality, developing a general philosophical method for such
          analyses. His phenomenological analysis highlighted the limitations of
          Cartesian ideas, challenging the assumption that the external world is
          unperceived and unperceivable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alfred North Whitehead, another mathematician-turned-philosopher, also
          contributed significantly to this critique of Cartesianism. Initially
          focused on the foundations of mathematics and a pioneer in
          mathematical logic, Whitehead later examined the underpinnings of
          physical science. He identified a philosophical disorder in the
          foundations of science and criticized the continued adherence to
          Newtonian concepts despite their denial in modern thought.
          Whitehead&#x27;s central critique was the &#x27;fallacy of misplaced
          concreteness&#x27;—the mistake of treating abstract concepts as
          concrete realities, leading to a misunderstanding of the actual world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitehead noted that scientific methodology is limited, only
          addressing part of human experience and thus blind to certain aspects
          of nature. He attributed this limitation partly to Cartesian dualism,
          which separated mind and body and hindered a fuller understanding of
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Husserl and Whitehead suggest a return to more natural and intuitive
          human understandings of the world, opposing the Cartesian view.
          However, recognizing that perception transcends the subjective realm
          does not fully explain how this happens. The core mystery remains
          unsolved, and it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that these issues are
          not trivial. The errors of Descartes and his followers stemmed from
          complex and difficult issues.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, the later developments in philosophy, which were briefly
          outlined, have had minimal direct influence on the scientific mindset
          of the present. Despite the breakdown of classical physics, the
          Newtonian worldview and positivism largely remain dominant.
          Scientists, influenced heavily by Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia,&quot;
          have ingrained these modes of thought to the extent that they seem
          self-evident, leading to the dismissal of any differing viewpoints as
          incomprehensible. While there have been exceptions, the scientific
          community has generally been resistant to philosophical influences
          post-Newton.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there has been a shift in understanding the role of the
          scientist, who is now seen as more than just an observer, contributing
          creatively to the scientific process and shaping scientific knowledge.
          The concept of &quot;models&quot; in science has gained popularity,
          acknowledging that science deals with theories representing aspects of
          truth rather than the physical world itself. This understanding
          suggests that even Newtonian physics, despite its success, is just one
          theory among many, each with its own uses and limitations. The
          scientific mindset is becoming more pragmatic and less inclined to
          idolize its creations, recognizing the limitations and potential for
          change in scientific theories.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this sophistication doesn&#x27;t necessarily enlighten us on
          fundamental issues or resolve the confusion in scientific thought,
          philosophical cosmology, and epistemology. It might even encourage a
          superficial pluralism that avoids rather than solves the core problem.
          This attitude aligns with pragmatism or what Whitehead described as
          &#x27;popular positivism,&#x27; where utility replaces truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on the logical content of science, it&#x27;s evident that
          science promotes a doctrine with significant claims about the physical
          universe that influence other thought areas. Science continues to
          assert truths based on discoveries, a practice that began in the
          Newtonian era and persists today. This scientific worldview, despite
          recent developments and a shift towards pragmatism, still
          fundamentally reflects the original Newtonian and Cartesian doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the technical level, physics might seem indifferent to these
          metaphysical foundations, as positivism and operationism suggest that
          physics deals with concrete procedures rather than metaphysical
          speculations. However, this perspective doesn&#x27;t represent a
          worldview but rather a methodological approach, akin to the mindset of
          a computer. A strictly positivistic perspective is unlikely, as it
          would require a complete detachment from metaphysical notions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scientific worldview, including positivistic ideas, is more
          complex and cannot be reduced to operational definitions alone.
          It&#x27;s meant to provide a view of the real world and a doctrine on
          the physical universe&#x27;s nature. Despite criticisms and attempts
          to establish new theoretical foundations (like Whitehead&#x27;s
          metaphysical doctrine), these new theories remain confined to
          specialized circles and have not significantly influenced the broader
          scientific community. The prevailing intellectual climate tends to
          avoid deeper questions, allowing Cartesian confusion to persist
          unchallenged.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the worldview associated with precise science is
          riddled with fundamental misconceptions. The supposedly scientific
          worldview is built on hidden philosophical or a priori assumptions,
          ultimately self-contradictory, leading to the acceptance of a fantasy
          in the name of physics.
