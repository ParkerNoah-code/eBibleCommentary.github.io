        <h2>Objective of the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Smith makes an important distinction between scientific knowledge,
          that which is observable and emperically verifiable, and scientistic
          belief, that which is presupposed in science and not subject to
          scientific analysis. Scientific knowledge can be rigorously verified
          through the scientific method. It relies on tangible evidence and is
          continually subject to scrutiny and validation. In contrast,
          scientistic beliefs are not able to be empirically verified, but form
          the philosophical underpinnings of scientific endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, he seeks to demonstrate that many of the metaphysical
          scientistic tenets upon which science rests are volatile and
          groundless. Looking at the fields of cosmology, evolution, and
          psychology, Smith traces the origin of the scientistic unconscious
          that has formed an unfounded, dogmatic confidence in science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, having revealed the limitations of emperical science and
          scientistic belief, he considers the metaphysical concept of
          transcendence, thus "breaking through the barrier of scientistic
          belief." In presenting this idea of transcendence, he gives an
          enlarged picture of the universe and of what lies beyond it.

        <h1>The Physical Universe</h1>
        <h2>Metaphysical Bifurcation</h2>
        <p>
          Typical explanations of what the physical universe is made of include
          space, time, and matter, or matter and energy, or something more
          complicated and inconceivable.<sup>1</sup> But all of these
          explanations share in common that the universe is conceived of in an
          abstract mathematical way. Light is electromagnetic radiation with a
          certain range of wavelengths. Sound is a pressure wave created by
          vibration. Odor is a mixture of tiny chemical particles released into
          the air. Thoughts are patterns of neurons firing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This physical picture of the universe cuts out nearly everything
          involved in the human point of view. The outside world and our
          perceptions of that outside world become completely seperated,
          distinct things.<sup>2</sup> This bifurcation into primary qualities,
          the noumenal, and secondary qualities, the phenomenal, is at the heart
          of science. Primary qualities such as size, shape, and position are
          seen as those things which are real about the object. Secondary
          qualities like color, taste, and smell then are mere products of the
          mind, and the mind is reduced to the primary qualities of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of this position is that everything is reduced to an
          abstraction. No longer do we have a universe because all that's left
          is a model, and we've mistaken the model to be all that there is.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), the first known to give an argument for a
          version of the primary/secondary quality distinction, uses many
          examples like the oar in the water to argue that the various
          appearances of a body are inessential while the primary affections
          like size, shape, and number are essential to bodies.<sup>3</sup>
          Likewise, René Descartes (1596-1650) distinguishes between sensible
          qualities and material bodies.<sup>4</sup> This is seen clearly in his
          ideas that the mind and body are distinct, independent substances and
          that matter and motion can explain everything in the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This set the stage for Isaac Newton (1642-1727) to popularize a
          philosophy of Cartesian metaphysics and extreme empiricism.<sup
            >5</sup
          >
          This primarily took place through the <em>Principia</em> which was
          seen as the exemplar of scientific achievement.<sup>6</sup> By the end
          of the 19th century, Newtonian physics appeared unassailable, and his
          philosophy followed uncritically with all the authority that his
          physics did. Despite this significant achievement, certain insoluble
          difficulties remained. It wouldn't be long before a paradigm shift
          took place in physics with the advent of the special theory of
          relativity of Albert Einstein (1879-1955).<sup>7</sup>
          Despite this theoretical shift away from Newtonian physics, Newton's
          questionable metaphysical bifurcation still loomed large.
        </p>
        <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Physicists in the early 20th century began to reassess the foundations
          of Newtonian physics. This reevaluation revealed that Newtonian
          physics was not dealing with absolute entities that exist
          independently of observation. Instead, it focused on what could be
          observed, marking a significant shift in the understanding of the
          physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity played a crucial role
          in addressing the limitations of classical physics. It merged space
          and time into a unified concept known as spacetime. This theory
          extended classical physics into the macrocosmic realm, providing a
          more comprehensive framework for understanding the physical universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics is built on the foundations of Heisenberg's
          uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle, a key element of
          quantum mechanics, imposes strict limits on our ability to
          simultaneously know certain pairs of properties, such as an object's
          position and momentum. This limitation underscores the intrinsic
          subjectivity of quantum physics, as it implies that our knowledge of
          the physical world is inherently statistical and uncertain. The
          wave-function represents a system but doesn't describe the system
          itself; rather, it embodies our knowledge of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics introduced the concept of wave-particle dualism.
          This means that particles, such as electrons, can behave both as
          discrete particles and as continuous waves depending on the
          experimental context. This challenges classical ideas of distinct,
          solid particles. This wave-particle dualism defies classical
          determinism and highlights the inherent complexity of the physical
          world.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Classical descriptions have eroded, leaving only mathematical
          formalisms and equations. The concept of fundamental particles
          dissolved as scientific progress challenged classical expectations.
          The status of the physical universe is still debated. It is subject to
          philosophical scrutiny, but it remains an implicit background
          assumption in the scientific worldview.
