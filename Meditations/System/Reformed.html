        <h2>Calvinism</h2>
        <p>
          The terms "Reformed" and "Calvinist" are often used interchangeably.
          Calvinism derives its name from John Calvin, a 16th-century French
          theologian and reformer, though it draws heavily from earlier
          theological figures like Augustine. While Calvin's influence is
          undeniable, it's crucial to recognize that Calvinism seeks to be
          biblical first and foremost.

          Calvinism is specifically known for its emphasis on the sovereignty of
          God, predestination, and the five points of doctrine encapsulated in
          TULIP: Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement,
          Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the Saints. These five points
          were a response to the five doctrinal challenges raised by Jacobus
          Arminius, and serve as a hepful way to distinguish Calvinism from
          Arminianism. However, the Reformed faith as a whole also focuses on
          other key principles such as the authority of Scripture, the
          priesthood of all believers, and justification by faith alone.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Calvinism's roots can be traced back to the early church, especially
          to Augustine of Hippo, whose writings on grace, predestination, and
          original sin laid the groundwork for many Calvinist doctrines. The
          Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, a movement against certain
          practices of the Roman Catholic Church, provided the context for the
          development of Calvinism. Reformers like Martin Luther significantly
          influenced Calvin, who systematized and expanded reformed ideas.

          Calvinism has deeply influenced many traditional Protestant churches.
          It played a significant role in the formation of the Presbyterian,
          Reformed, and Congregationalist churches, among others.

        <h1>TULIP</h1>
        <h2>Total Depravity</h2>
        <p>
          This doctrine may more accurately be termed "Radical Depravity." The
          word "total" in this context does not mean humans are as evil as
          possible, but rather that sin affects every aspect of a person's
          being. Because of the Fall, every part of human nature has been
          corrupted and enslaved by sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, humans in their natural state are morally and spiritually
          unable to follow God. This inability is not due to a lack of physical
          or intellectual capability, but a deep-seated corruption of the human
          will and desires. People are enslaved to sin and cannot convert
          themselves. This underscores the need for divine intervention for
          salvation, leading to the doctrines of Unconditional Election and
          Irresistible Grace, where God elects individuals for salvation and
          effectively draws them to Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Total Depravity is often misunderstood to mean that people are
          incapable of any good whatsoever. However, Calvinists assert that
          unregenerate (non-Christian) people can still perform actions that are
          good in a societal or humanitarian sense, but these actions cannot
          please God or meet the standards of true spiritual righteousness.
