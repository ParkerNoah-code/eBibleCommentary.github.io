          Although Protestant churches have done away with many of the errors of
          Rome, Paedobaptist churches still inconsistency hold to infant baptism
          and break principles of the New Testament as a result. The following
          ten lectures call for those beliefs and practices to be reformed
          according to Scripture. First the nature, role, and importance of
          religious reformers is addressed, and then Baptist principles are
          shown to come from the Bible.

          >, 1876:
        </p>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>
          The following Lectures were not originally intended for the press;
          but, in compliance with the wish of some of those who listened to
          them, the author has been induced to publish them. It is only with the
          hope that they may tend to advance a pure Christianity, that they are
          now given to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author regards it as one of the auspicious signs of the times,
          that greater attention is beginning to be given, by Baptist writers,
          to the great principles involved in the action of our denomination,
          rather than to a revival of the philological question, which the
          scholarship of the world has long ago decided in our favor. The more
          these principles are exhibited and developed, the more they will gain
          the approbation of all who sincerely love &quot;the truth as it is in
          Jesus.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This course appears the more necessary and desirable, from the fact
          that Baptist principles have been extensively misrepresented, and much
          misunderstood. It seems important, too, from the fact that many
          persons have united with the denomination, from a conviction that our
          practice, in reference to the mode and subjects of baptism, is
          strictly Scriptural, while they have not clearly comprehended all that
          is involved in our position and peculiarities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Lectures were presented to, and are published for, Protestants.
          They tend to show that Protestantism itself needs to be reformed—that
          it is sadly defective as an instrument of attack upon the errors of
          Rome, and the evils of the Papacy. How conclusively this is done, the
          reader must decide. The presentation of these defects has not been a
          work in which the author has delighted or rejoiced, except as he has
          been led to hope that their exposure might lead to their abandonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toward those who bear a resemblance to Christ in their moral features,
          he cherishes sincere affection; and the firm belief that the great
          majority of the professed disciples of Christ in the Protestant
          churches in this country, bear such resemblance, encourages him to
          look for success in seeking to advance scriptural views of Gospel
          ordinances.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the sincere prayer that their publication may aid in bringing
          &quot;all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,&quot; to the
          only platform of Christian union—Bible truth—these Lectures are
          commended to the candid consideration of the reader, and to the
          blessing of God.
        </p>
        <h2>Preface 1876</h2>
        <p>
          The following Lectures have a peculiar history. They were originally
          delivered to the Baptist Church in Caldwell, N. J., in the ordinary
          course of pastoral labors in that place, and were not then intended
          for the press. At the urgent request of those who heard them, the
          author was induced to give them to the public. They were delivered
          from meager notes, and from these, as his &quot;copy,&quot; the
          author, himself a practical printer, set up the types of the first
          edition, which was published in 1858. As much of the matter was thus
          extemporized, at the &quot;case,&quot; the entire book was never
          written. The late excellent Spencer H. Cone then pastor of the First
          Baptist Church of New York city, read the proofs, and so well pleased
          was he with the work, that he ordered the first fifty copies for his
          own church, recommending it from his pulpit as well as by the notice
          which appears among the &quot;Recommendations.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Several editions were printed during the few following years, and the
          work was widely circulated through the country, and seems to have
          given a new phase to the baptismal controversy, by directing attention
          to the great principles which underlie the action of the Baptist
          denomination. It shows that these principles, though based on
          God&#x27;s Word, are constantly violated by Protestant Paedobaptists,
          though they profess to be governed by that Word. Not a few of these
          have been led, by the perusal of previous editions, to see the utter
          inconsistency of Paedobaptism with the principles of the New
          Testament, and have renounced it, and united with the Baptist
          denomination. Among these, several highly honored and useful brethren,
          now in the ministry of the denomination, might be named.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occurrence of our National Centennial seemed to the author an
          appropriate time to issue a revised and enlarged edition, especially
          as some years have elapsed since the plates of the first editions were
          destroyed, and during all that time applications have been made for
          the work, which could not be supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the advocacy and propagation of the principles here presented, our
          country owes all it possesses of true greatness. American principles
          are, essentially, Baptist principles, and this is owing to the fact
          that Baptist principles have impressed themselves upon the nation, as
          the only principles consistent with a government divorced from
          ecclesiastical control, and recognizing the universal right to civil
          and religious liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to the recognition and prevalence of these principles, the
          evangelical Paedobaptist churches of our land owe their spirituality
          and moral power, in spite of the inconsistency of infant baptism, the
          legitimate and baneful fruits of which are nipped in the bud by the
          influence of Baptist churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the earnest prayer that the present edition may be as useful, at
          least, as previous ones, in leading Christians of every name to the
          knowledge and practice of Bible truth, the work is commended to the
          blessing of God, and the candid consideration of the reader.

            >The Aim, the Reproach, and the Triumph of the Religious
            Reformer</em

        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;These men who have turned the world upside down have come here
          also!&quot; Acts 17:6
        </p>
        <p>
          It has always been the policy of the advocates of error, when unable
          to sustain themselves by sophistry, specious reasoning and false
          logic—to stigmatize the advocates of the truth as disturbers of the
          peace, and dangerous to the harmony and interests of the community.
          Such was the course pursued by those who uttered the language of the
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul and Silas, having been released from the Macedonian prison, where
          they had been confined for preaching the Gospel, took their departure
          from Philippi, and passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
          &quot;they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the
          Jews.&quot; Here Paul, according to his usual custom, met the Jewish
          rabbis and teachers, and reasoned with them out of the Old Testament
          Scriptures, concerning Jesus of Nazareth—proving to them that he was
          the Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          His reasoning on this subject was so forcible, that many of the Jews
          were convinced, and professed their faith in the Savior. This stirred
          up the hatred and envy of the baffled rabbis; and, finding themselves
          unable to cope with the superior logic and masterly reasoning of Paul,
          they enlisted the prejudices of the rabbis, and gathered a mob, and
          created a riot, and endeavored to lay violent hands on the
          disciples—and thus accomplish by force and superior numbers, what they
          could not effect by fair argument. Their accusation against the
          disciples is contained in the words of the text: &quot;These men who
          have turned the world upside down have come here also!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The AIM of the Religious Reformer. A Reformer is one who seeks to
          remove abuses which have crept into an organization or community, or
          one who boldly enters a field where error has held undisputed sway,
          and fearlessly wields amid giant powers of opposition, the weapons of
          truth. He aims to entirely revolutionize the minds of the community in
          which he labors, on that particular subject where he believes reform
          to he needed. A compromise between truth and error is not what he
          seeks, and will not satisfy him. &quot;The truth, the whole truth, and
          nothing but the truth,&quot; is his motto.
        </p>
        <p>
          Old systems of error, however sacred on account of their antiquity, he
          boldly attacks. Though massive darkness has long brooded over the
          people, he aims to dissipate the gloom, and shed upon them brilliant
          rays of light. His work is a mighty one; the end for which he labors
          is noble and sublime. He holds a position in advance of the community
          in which he resides, and the age in which he lives—hence he possesses
          traits of character that are peculiar, which fit him to toil and
          suffer for the accomplishment of his designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spirit of noble daring is his. He fears not to grapple with error,
          though sanctioned by age, and supported by popular favor. He scruples
          not, if need be, to stand alone, as the champion of truth. With
          undaunted intrepidity he braves the &quot;world&#x27;s dread
          laugh&quot; or meets its frown. With a spirit of indomitable
          perseverance, he steadily adheres to his purpose and determinedly
          pursues his single object. Every obstacle thrown across his path
          affords a new incentive to increased activity. Every difficulty he
          meets, only gives new strength and inspires fresh courage. He is not
          to be turned aside. Having put his hand to the plough, he looks not
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-sacrificing effort and benevolent labor are his. His time,
          talents, property, are all laid upon the altar of truth. He toils, not
          to achieve a name, to amass wealth, or to advance a sect. He labors
          for the good of others—while often he receives only their hatred,
          reproach and persecution. If there is one picture on earth that
          reminds us, more than any other, of the meek and lowly Savior, it is
          the spirit and conduct of the reformer, patiently suffering at the
          hands of those whose moral elevation he labors to effect. And here is
          the test by which the true and false reformer may be tried and
          discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infidelity boasts of seeking a reform. But when did Infidelity ever
          inspire its advocates with a spirit of self-denial for the good of
          others? Where are its sacrifices made to benefit and elevate the human
          race? Did infidelity ever suffer to benefit man? Does it today go
          forth, as an angel of mercy—to labor, to suffer, and to bless? No, no!
          But the true reformer has a high purpose, a benevolent aim; he
          occupies holy ground, and he can suffer, unjustly suffer, to benefit
          his fellow-men. Let us notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The REPROACH of the Reformer. All Reforms are attended with
          agitation and conflict, but none more so than reforms in religion. At
          first, the reformer may attract but little attention. His attacks on
          error may appear so feeble, and his efforts to advance the truth may
          seem so faint, that the opponents of truth may esteem only the smile
          of ridicule and scorn necessary to throw his work into insignificance,
          or a slight exertion of authority sufficient to extinguish it. But let
          him continue with boldness, energy and eloquence, to plead for truth
          and begin to make an impression upon the public mind, and gather
          adherents around him; then will his adversaries become agitated and
          alarmed! Like the fierce storm, lashing into foam the waters of the
          mighty deep—they stir up the popular mind, until the entire community
          moves in angry surges, and persecution and violence ensue. The more
          bold the onset, the more forcible the elucidation of truth, the more
          numerous the adherents to the reform—the more fiercely will the
          advocates of error oppose the effort, and the more desperately will
          they seek to crush by force, or circumvent by cunning, what they
          cannot master by argument, or defeat by sound logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such an event, the reformer labors under every disadvantage. He is
          reproached as a disturber of the public peace. He is regarded as the
          cause of all the confusion and uproar, and must bear all the odium
          connected with it. Look at the text and its connection. The disciples
          had peacefully taught in the synagogue in Thessalonica, yet all the
          uproar was charged upon them: &quot;These men who have turned the
          world upside down have come here also!&quot; Thus it has ever been.
          The opposers of reform have lashed into fury the elements of political
          strife, and then have charged the peace-loving disciples of truth with
          all the disastrous results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reformer is also reproached as a revolutionist. He is opposing old
          customs and popular usages. He seems to be ruthlessly trampling on all
          that has been held beautiful and venerable. He seems to be setting up
          individual and novel opinions against the united and established
          wisdom of ages. He seems to be destroying everything and advancing
          nothing. He seems to be a reckless intruder, trespassing on ground
          rightfully occupied by others. He seems to touch sacred things with an
          impious hand. He seems to be sowing dissensions, destroying hallowed
          institutions, and introducing unauthorized innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he perceives that these old forms and venerated institutions are
          the offspring of error, and that truth and right demand their
          extermination; in the name of God, therefore, he goes forth, to
          overturn, to revolutionize, and to reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is further reproached as illiberal, uncharitable, bigoted, and
          narrow-minded. Because he refuses to call error truth, and darkness
          light, and wrong right, the slaves of error, the victims of darkness,
          and the followers of wrong conclude that he is uncharitable and
          narrow-minded. They forget that it is the highest charity to expose
          error and oppose wrong, and that only the largest minds and most
          benevolent hearts will seek to disseminate light and dispel darkness,
          even though &quot;the darkness does not comprehend it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There never yet was a reform attempted, that did not suffer the
          reproach of the dominant party. Look at that old reformer Lot:
          &quot;This one fellow came in to sojourn, and will needs be a
          judge.&quot; Look at Moses, the prophets, John the Baptist, Martin
          Luther, Roger Williams. All these were reproached as revolutionists,
          and virtually charged with &quot;turning the world upside down.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the greatest revolutionist that ever appeared in our world was
          Jesus Christ. He was the Great Reformer. He aimed directly to abolish
          the old dispensation and make all things new. He paid no respect to .
          . .
        </p>
        <p>the antiquity of the scribe,</p>
        <p>the morality of the Pharisee,</p>
        <p>or the sanctity of the priest.</p>
        <p>
          He threw himself upon the merits of the truths he delivered, and
          declared himself a radical revolutionist and reformer. Did not He meet
          reproach? Let the purple robe, the reed scepter, the thorny crown, the
          mocking homage, and the blood-stained cross reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles were reproached. The Gospel which they preached was a
          great innovation upon old and venerable institutions. No reform could
          ever be compared with that which they sought to effect. They aimed to
          overturn all the religions in the world. Hence they were accounted
          &quot;vagabonds, fools, and madmen.&quot; They were treated with
          ridicule, scorn, and contempt. They, a few ignorant fishermen, seeking
          to abolish those religions which had stood for centuries, and which
          had gathered around them all the charms of history, philosophy, and
          poetry; religions whose massive temples towered in majestic splendor
          to the very clouds—religions which numbered among their devotees,
          crowds of kings and heroes, scholars and sages, and which were
          cherished by the most powerful and refined nations of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not strange that at first they were only deemed worthy of
          ridicule; nor is it surprising, that as success crowned their
          persevering labors, they became the subjects of violent hate and
          bitter persecution. They were shaking the foundations of ancient
          superstitions, they were disturbers of the public peace, they were
          detestable revolutionists, they were hateful reformers, in short, they
          were &quot;turning the world upside down!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This kind of reproach Baptists especially have been called to endure.
          They are great revolutionists. Of all persecuted sects, the Baptists
          stand forth as most prominent, simply and only because they aim at a
          more complete and thorough reform than any others ever attempted. They
          teach that Christ&#x27;s kingdom is not of this world. They teach that
          the church is not a national, political, or provincial
          establishment—but a congregation of holy men, separated from the world
          by the receiving of the Holy Spirit. They seek to &quot;turn the world
          upside down&quot;—not in the odious sense, but in the proper and
          desirable sense. The world is wrong; it is morally wrong side up; it
          needs to be revolutionized, and primitive Christianity alone can do
          it! This is the instrument by which Baptists aim to accomplish their
          design. By the propagation of primitive Christianity, they confidently
          expect to achieve a complete and entire Reformation in the Pagan,
          Romish, and Protestant world, and bring the race of man back to God.
          We pass on to notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The TRIUMPH of the reformer. The true religious reformer must
          ultimately triumph. However opposed, reproached, and persecuted, he
          triumphs. Even when he appears to be defeated, he triumphs. While he
          struggles on in adversity, and while sad reverses meet him in his
          work, still he triumphs. The power of the truth is manifest in the
          support it yields him amid these disheartening circumstances. The
          consciousness that he has discharged his duty with fidelity, fills his
          mind with peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          He feels that the smile of God is upon him; hence the frowns of the
          opposers of truth, and their anathemas, are lighter than vanity to
          him. He esteems &quot;the reproaches of Christ greater riches than all
          the treasures&quot; of earth! The shame of the cross he counts greater
          honor than all the applause of the world, and the martyr&#x27;s death
          is to him sweeter than all earthly pleasures. He exhibits a dignity of
          character that far outshines all others, and totally eclipses, on the
          historic page, all his slanderous persecutors. He is as far superior
          to the time-serving demagogue, as are the burning beams of the
          meridian sun compared to the last sickly rays of the feeble candle,
          flickering in its socket, and just ready to expire.

          He knows no fear of consequences. Duty, it is his to perform—results,
          are God&#x27;s to control. He stands firmly, as the rock in the ocean,
          unmoved amid the howlings of the tempest and the fury of the waves.
          For him there is a glorious future, however dark the hour of trial may
          be; and though for a time he endures reproach, he will have a name
          when his persecutors have perished and are forgotten.

          Every true religious reformer that ever lived in our world triumphed.
          Daniel, and the three Hebrew worthies, possessed the spirit, endured
          the reproach, and achieved the triumph of Reformers; they saw their
          enemies clothed with shame, and the cause of God, which they had
          espoused, gloriously advanced. And though their pathway to success lay
          through the lions&#x27; den and the burning furnace, these only made
          their triumph more sublime, and shed a new halo around their names.
        </p>
        <p>
          Martin Luther triumphed—and though Rome anathematized and bitterly
          execrated him, the name of the poor monk of Erfurth is honored
          wherever evangelical Christianity prevails; while the distinguishing
          doctrine for which he contended has become one of the strong bulwarks
          of the Protestant world, and the terror of Antichrist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roger Williams triumphed—though banished from the Massachusetts
          colony, and driven into the desert wilds among the Indians. The
          religious liberty for which he suffered, and which American citizens
          today enjoy, forms the most distinguishing and pre-eminent glory of
          our country.

          How superior is the fame of such men, to that of the mere military
          hero! Napoleon won his fifty battles; William Carey translated the
          Bible into almost as many different languages; and while today the
          name of Napoleon begets sentiments of disgust, or wakes emotions of
          unhallowed ambition—the name of William Carey touches a chord in every
          Christian bosom, arousing to new life and to more unreserved
          consecration to Christ, the energies of the ablest and best of
          Zion&#x27;s sons and daughters.

          There is a great deal of this work of reform before the church at the
          present day. Especially is this true of the Baptist churches of this
          country. They are prepared to labor for a more thorough reformation
          than any others can undertake. There are forms of error, productive of
          incalculable mischief, which none others can consistently attack;
          while all others retain and seek to perpetuate the unscriptural dogma
          of infant baptism, which with every other traditionary rite must be
          abolished, before the world&#x27;s revolution will be complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be remembered that each has a personal interest and
          responsibility in this matter. Let the inquiry be, &quot;Lord, what
          will you have me to do?&quot; Every Christian is to aim to reform,
          first himself; then the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Word of God must be our weapon. With this, old forms of error must
          be attacked, and the conflict only end when the field is left in
          possession of truth. &quot;Therefore, since we are surrounded by such
          a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders
          and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance
          the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author
          and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the
          cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the
          throne of God.&quot; Hebrews 12:1-2

          <em>The RECEPTION Which Should Be Given to the Religious Reformer</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the
          Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and
          examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was
          true.&quot; Acts 17:11
        </p>
        <p>
          Infidelity and error have always delighted to taunt the disciples of
          Christ and the friends of truth with ignorant credulity, and the
          reception of unfounded and absurd dogmas, without due forethought and
          investigation. They have arrogated to themselves all the freedom of
          thought and independence of mind there is in the world, and profess to
          have calmly investigated the truths which they reject. The taunt on
          the one hand, and the assumption on the other, are both false; for it
          is a significant fact, that a pure Christianity has advanced just in
          proportion as the right of free and independent investigation has been
          enjoyed and exercised. Moreover, it is the glory of Christianity, that
          it courts the test of candid examination, and commends such a course
          whenever adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a striking illustration of this in the text and its
          connection. The apostle Paul, having been driven from Thessalonica by
          an infuriated mob, excited to deeds of violence by bigoted and
          interested partisans, fled to Berea. Here he pursued a course similar
          to that which he had adopted in Thessalonica. He entered the Jewish
          synagogue and taught in the name of Jesus. The community in this place
          was composed of men of more independent minds, and nobler spirit than
          the Thessalonians; and, consequently, they gave the apostle a far
          different reception from that which he experienced in their city. They
          were not afraid to discuss, examine, and fairly investigate the new
          doctrine which he introduced to them, and after bringing it to the
          proper test, to let it stand or fall on its own merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conduct was truly noble; and as such, it is endorsed by the Holy
          Spirit in the inspired words of the text: &quot;Now the Bereans were
          of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the
          message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to
          see if what Paul said was true.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the apostle appeared among them as a reformer, they did not
          consider him an intruder, or treat him as an revolutionist; but they
          acted like rational, intelligent beings; they acted like men; they
          acted as all should act under like circumstances. Our theme on the
          present occasion will be, &quot;The Reception That Should Be Given to
          the Religious Reformer.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In illustrating this theme, I shall invite your attention to the
          conduct of the Bereans, and their treatment of Paul and Silas, as the
          divinely approved example. This example will appear to better
          advantage, if we follow the phraseology of the text, and notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. the Comparison Instituted. &quot;Now the Bereans were of more noble
          character than the Thessalonians.&quot; The Thessalonian Jews had
          exhibited a spirit of gross intolerance. They were destitute of that
          spirit which truly ennobles man. They had power and influence, and
          they used these to crush the weak. They were filled with envy and
          jealousy, and they gave vent to their feelings in acts of violence and
          oppression. Refusing to be convinced themselves, they determined to
          prevent all others from being convinced. They appealed to passion, and
          prejudice, rather than to judgment and reason. They made old opinions,
          and popular usages, the standard and test by which they tried the
          apostles&#x27; teaching, instead of the Word of God. They falsely
          accused them of disturbing the peace of society; and, by a willful
          misconstruction of their words, they even charged them with
          treasonable designs against the government: &quot;These,&quot; said
          they, &quot;all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that
          there is another king, one called Jesus.&quot; They drove them
          entirely away from their city, and then persecuted those who had
          hospitably entertained them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor was this all. They followed them to Berea, and stirred up the
          people there, so that Paul was compelled to leave that place. Now, in
          contrast with this course, notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Reception of the Apostles by the Bereans. &quot;They received
          the message with great eagerness.&quot; They were wedded to the same
          rites as were the Jews in Thessalonica. Their prejudices were in favor
          of Judaism and arrayed against Christianity. Hence, the teaching of
          the apostle was as much opposed to their views, as to those of the
          Thessalonians; but notwithstanding all this, &quot;they received the
          message with great eagerness.&quot; This implies that they received
          it,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This implies that they received te word RESPECTFULLY. It is too
          frequently the case, that when the truth is presented to those who
          have long cherished religions error—they treat it with ridicule,
          especially where it comes in contact with their preconceived opinions.
          Thus the Athenians treated Paul, when he broached the doctrine of the
          resurrection, &quot;When they heard about the resurrection of the
          dead, some of them sneered; but others said: We want to hear you again
          on this subject.&quot; (Acts 17:32)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is, often, in our day. The curling lip, and the sneer of
          contempt, and the expression of ridicule, are seen and heard as soon
          as a favorite dogma is touched, no matter how kindly. Not so with the
          Bereans. However novel the doctrines of the apostle appeared, however
          opposite to what they had been taught, or however different from their
          previously formed opinions—they listened to what he presented with
          respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They received the word with OPENNESS. They were disposed to be
          frank and fair. They were open to conviction—honest and sincere in
          their conclusions. They kept their minds free from an undue bias, and
          let every argument have its full weight. They were disposed to think
          and judge according to truth and justice. They were willing to admit
          every reasonable and logical conclusion. They banished prejudice, and
          examined the subject impartially.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the proper way to arrive at the truth. God gave us our reason
          to be exercised in religious matters, as well as in worldly affairs.
          These Bereans neither exhibited bigotry on the one hand, nor credulity
          on the other. They were willing to hear, and then they judged for
          themselves, and formed their own conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is all that can be demanded. This course was honorable to
          themselves, and would make even those respect them who differed from
          them. And this is true of any man, or body of men. Let them be open,
          fair and frank, and they will win the respect of those who arrive at,
          a different conclusion from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They received the word PATIENTLY. They did not get angry with the
          apostle, or exhibit signs of irritation, or cherish feelings of malice
          toward him—because he sought to convert them from Judaism. Though it
          was the religion of their fathers—though they had been brought up in
          it—though their prejudices were strongly wedded to its rites and
          ceremonies—still, they calmly listened to the reasons urged by the
          apostle why they should abandon it, and connect themselves with that
          sect which was &quot;everywhere spoken against.&quot; They were not
          offended at Paul&#x27;s zeal; their minds were unruffled, and day
          after day they came to patiently hear him through.
        </p>
        <p>
          How different is this from the conduct of most persons. Just touch
          their peculiar doctrines, or hint that the rites which they observe
          are unscriptural, and without waiting to hear the reasons for such an
          opinion, they at once become agitated, and impatiently desire to leave
          the place and inwardly determine that they will not again enter it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not so with the noble Bereans. They wished to find the truth, though
          it might lie in a different direction from that in which they had been
          accustomed to seek it. They desired to follow the truth, though it
          might lead to the abandonment of time-honored customs and the breaking
          up of old and pleasant associations. Therefore, &quot;they received
          the message with great eagerness.&quot; Such a course might offend
          interested partisans, but God commends it as noble. We notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Test by Which They Tried the Teaching of the Apostles.
          &quot;They examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said
          was true.&quot; This is the divine standard of appeal. God gave it as
          our guide, and we are commanded to search it. Scripture is to be the
          test of all religious teaching; and the conduct of the Bereans in
          making it the test of Paul&#x27;s preaching is honored by its divine
          Author; for let it not be forgotten that it is Jehovah who speaks in
          the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          They did not appeal to Tradition. They might have done this. Rumor
          said that Christ was an impostor; Paul affirmed that He was the
          Messiah. How were they to decide? Simply by appealing to the
          Scriptures. They did not appeal to their priests and rabbis. They had
          told them to oppose Christianity, and seek to exterminate it. But they
          knew their priests were fallible men, and that if they obeyed them,
          they might possibly be &quot;found fighting against God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They did not appeal to their own preference, and interest, and
          convenience. These would have prompted them to reject the
          investigation of the doctrine, and decide at once in accordance with
          tradition and popular customs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abandoning all these false and uncertain standards, they appealed to
          the Scriptures, to settle the differences between their views and
          those of their reformers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They &quot;searched&quot; the Scriptures; as one who seeks for
          something that is lost. Many persons read the Bible only to find
          support for what they already believe, and search the Scriptures to
          prove that what is new to them is not so. But these Bereans exhibited
          the same openness in testing the word, that they did in its reception.
          If the Scriptures sustained the apostle, they adopted his views; if
          not, they rejected them. Thus they honored God, and exempted
          themselves from the charge of willful ignorance, intolerance, and
          superstition.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reception that should always be given to those who aim to
          reform a community, whether that reformation is universal, or whether
          it have reference only to a single doctrine or ordinance. Such a
          reception is all we ask for these Lectures. Such a reception is all
          Baptists ask anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who hold the truth have nothing to fear from such a course.
          Respectful, candid, and patient attention, will enable them the more
          readily to detect sophistry and specious reasoning, and the study of
          the Bible will always expose what is unscriptural and erroneous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, this course has the sanction of Jehovah, however much it may
          offend men. The Bible should be the test of all preaching. That man
          who desires to make himself the umpire and final standard of appeal to
          his congregation, involves himself in a fearful responsibility, and
          virtually claims for himself infallibility. Yet some ministers appear
          offended if their authority is questioned, or if their preaching is
          tested by the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul did not do so. Though inspired, he commended the course of those,
          who, instead of taking his word for it, examined the Scriptures for
          themselves, to see whether those things which he taught them were so.
          To adopt a contrary course, and blindly follow a minister or priest,
          is downright Romanism! And, if pursued universally, this would . . .
        </p>
        <p>arrest the progress of the Gospel,</p>
        <p>and clog the wheels of truth,</p>
        <p>and stamp error with immutability.</p>
        <p>
          What if the Hindu, the Burman, and the Chinese follow their priests,
          and universally determine never to examine Christianity? What if the
          Mohammedan, Romanist and Greek, follow their teachers? What if the
          Universalist, Infidel, and Atheist, follow their champions! These have
          as much warrant to do this, as the Presbyterian, Methodist, or
          Baptist. No, my brethren, your minister is not to be the umpire or
          standard. There is but one who could say, &quot;Follow Me!&quot; and
          that was Christ. We point you to Him. We direct you to His Word as the
          standard of your beliefs, and to His example as the pattern of your
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, in these Lectures, we say anything that conflicts with these,
          reject it; but if you God, on examination, that these things which we
          preach are so, remember, the whole responsibility of rejecting, not
          us, but the Word of God, and the meek and lowly Savior, rests at your
          own door.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the conduct of the Bereans were universally imitated, what happy
          events would follow! How soon would infidelity, and error, and
          superstition vanish before the influence of sound reason and Scripture
          truth. What courtesy, and forbearance, and love, would be manifested
          among brethren who differ. How much more diligently would the Bible be
          studied, and how soon would the multitude of sects and parties
          disappear, and the Savior&#x27;s prayer that they all might be one
          would be answered!
        </p>
        <p>
          The contrary course can benefit no one. If a man is in an error, no
          matter how trivial—it can do him no good to continue in that error.
          Especially, it can do him no good to dwarf his mind, and stunt his
          intellectual powers—in order that he may continue in it unmolested.
          Yet this is the effect of refusing a candid investigation of the
          truth. Further, if a man has the truth, he will not fear
          investigation, but rather court it, &quot;He who does the truth comes
          to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are
          wrought in God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          If a pretended reformer appears, there is no surer way of exposing the
          imposition, than the adoption of the example of the Bereans. But if a
          contrary course is pursued, it frequently leads to the exercise of a
          morbid sympathy toward those who hold injurious error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Baptists appear before the world as those who aim at a complete
          reform. They, appeal . . .
        </p>
        <p>not to the sympathies, but to the consciences of men;</p>
        <p>not to prejudice, but to reason;</p>
        <p>not to tradition but to the Scriptures.</p>
        <p>
          They simply ask for the reception which the Bereans gave to those who
          sought to convert them from Judaism to Christianity.
        </p>
        <h2>Lecture III.</h2>
        <p><em>The WEAPONS of the Religious Reformer</em></p>
        <p>
          &quot;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God
          for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high
          thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every
          thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ!&quot; 2 Corinthians
          10:4-5
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the introduction of sin into the world, there has been an
          unremitting conflict between truth and error. The earth has become a
          vast battle-ground—the theater of a mighty moral warfare. Truth and
          error are necessarily opposed to each other, and whenever they come in
          contact, a fierce contest ensues, which ends only when error is
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conflict is not, however, one of a material kind; nor should
          physical force be used in carrying it on. It is a moral warfare; and
          ultimate success can be sensed only by the use of corresponding
          weapons. The advocates of error may press into their service carnal
          weapons, as indeed they are always forced to do, in their vain efforts
          to sustain themselves and oppose the truth; but thus they only
          acknowledge their own weakness, and betray the defects of their cause,
          and insure in the end their own defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disciple of the truth needs no such weapons. He knows that they
          can yield him no advantage, and secure no permanent benefit; and he
          sees that they would only encumber and embarrass him in the conflict,
          and retard the cause he seeks to advance. He feels that in order to be
          successful, he must use only those means which God has appointed, and
          which He can bless. He therefore appropriately adopts the language of
          the text: &quot;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but
          mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and
          every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
          bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of
          Christ!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In conducting any enterprise, or effecting any work, instruments are
          necessary implements adapted to the end designed. The work of the
          reformer is, in a great measure, a work of destruction. He goes forth
          to demolish all that is opposed to truth—all that prevents its free
          and rapid advance. He is the pioneer, who is accounted &quot;famous
          according as he lifts up the axe upon the thick trees.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Error is rather negative than positive.</p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to enlighten man; error, like a cloud, intervenes
          to shut out its brilliant rays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to make man happy; error infuses poison, and
          introduces the ingredients of misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth was intended to make man free; error rears her fortress and
          strongholds, and makes him a captive in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the work of the reformer is to dissipate this cloud—to extract
          this poison—to pull down these strongholds. The work of Christ, the
          Great Reformer, was eminently a work of destruction. He was manifested
          that He might &quot;destroy the works of the devil.&quot; Let us
          notice,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The STRONGHOLDS which the religious reformer is called on to
          demolish.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Ignorance. All religious error is the offspring of ignorance and
          mistake. God is true, and His Word is true. No religious error can
          find any support there. Yet we know that error does exist to a vast
          extent. How mighty, then, is this fortress! and how strong! Look at
          the ignorance of heathen nations. See the ignorance of those who are
          under the dominion of the Papacy. Behold the lamentable ignorance of a
          vast majority of Protestants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the reformer meets this stronghold wherever he undertakes to
          labor. He beholds willful ignorance of plainly revealed truths. He
          beholds one body of men willfully ignorant of the views and practices
          of another body which they condemn. He finds himself misrepresented,
          misunderstood, and opposed—because men are entrenched in this
          stronghold of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle Paul once found himself a victim of misrepresentation
          which had gained currency simply through the inexcusable and willful
          ignorance of those who believed them. &quot;Are not you that
          Egyptian,&quot; he was asked, &quot;which, before these days made an
          uproar, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men that were
          murderers?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The religious reformer is frequently assailed with questions as
          absurd, betraying the willful ignorance of those who oppose him in his
          work. This ignorance he labors to remove.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Prejudice. Prejudices are generally in favor of that to which men
          are accustomed, and opposed to that which appears new to them. If men
          have been accustomed to error, they love it on account of its
          antiquity; and the inquiry too frequently is not: What is truth? But,
        </p>
        <p>Is it in accordance with our traditions?</p>
        <p>Is it what our fathers practiced?</p>
        <p>Is it what they taught us?</p>
        <p>
          Men speak of time-honored customs; they forget that, while errors may
          be time-honored, truth is eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prejudice is a mighty stronghold. Its walls are of adamantine strength
          and of almost impenetrable thickness. Entrenched in this fortress, men
          are unapproachable. The soundest logic, the strongest arguments, the
          most convincing proofs, the fairest reasonings—all fail, all are
          powerless, while prejudice holds the mind within her grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very work of the religious reformer brings him in direct contact
          with those customs which appeal most powerfully to men&#x27;s
          prejudices. He aims to remove old errors; but, in order to do this, he
          must first demolish the stronghold in which they are entrenched. He
          aims to convince men that it is better to be the willing subjects of
          reason, than the blind slaves of prejudice!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Self-interest. Many go with the crowd, merely because it is to
          their present interest. After they are enlightened by truth, and after
          their old prejudices are overcome—still, selfishness prevails; and
          instead of doing that which they know to be right, and laboring to
          advance the truth, they prefer to act contrary to their own
          convictions. They perceive that the truth is unpopular—that its
          advocacy will necessitate self-denial and sacrifice—that their
          temporal interests will suffer, and their names be cast out as evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the religions reformer aims to make men benevolent; he labors to
          make them willing to deny themselves and cheerfully suffer for the
          good of others and the sake of the truth. Selfishness must be
          demolished, this mighty stronghold must be pulled down, before the
          reformer can succeed in his work. Thus, the victims of error must be
          driven from every refuge, and their hiding-places must be destroyed,
          before they will be made free by the reception of the truth. Notice:
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The MEANS by which this is accomplished. These are stated in the
          text negatively. &quot;The weapons of our warfare are not
          carnal.&quot; The religious reformer does not invoke:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Civil Power. He does not seek to force men by legal enactments
          to embrace his views, or profess attachment to his cause. He does not
          seek to unite the Church with the State, or enforce his teachings at
          the edge of the sword and the point of the bayonet. He does not use
          persecution or oppression of any kind. He does not use authority of
          office, either civil or ecclesiastical. He does not use the authority
          growing out of the domestic relations to force the consciences of
          those who are subject to him, or compel them to adopt his views of
          truth. He utterly renounces compulsion of every kind. The gibbet, the
          rack, and the stake, are all discarded by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here was one radical defect of the Reformation of the sixteenth
          century. The civil arm was invoked, the State was united with the
          Church, a political element was infused, and carnal weapons were used
          as freely by the Reformed Churches in enforcing their dogmas, as by
          the Papacy in maintaining its heresies. The thorough religious
          reformer uses no such weapons. Neither does he employ,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Calumny and Misrepresentation. In order successfully to combat the
          opinions and practices of an opponent, individuals sometimes distort
          and falsify his views. They present an absurd doctrine, which is
          inconsistent both with reason and revelation, falsely charge it on
          those whom they oppose—and then eloquently declaim against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or they mistake the arguments used by their opponents to sustain their
          views, and endeavor to make the impression that they are but weak
          fanatics, or men laboring under mental imbecility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, they openly slander and vilify them, and injure their reputation.
          And thus they labor to bring into disrepute both the views and
          practices they oppose, and the persons who advocate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who persecute, love to have some pretext; they therefore first
          slander their victim—and then put him to death! Thus it was with
          Jesus; false witnesses rose against him; and though their testimony
          carried its refutation on its very face, it was made the pretext for
          his crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the thorough religious reformer, having no desire to persecute,
          needs no pretext for it; he therefore discards calumny and
          misrepresentation. Neither does he resort to,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Flattery and Deceitful Artifices. He appeals not to sinful
          passions, such as pride, ambition, self-indulgence and a desire for
          worldly honor. This is often done in order to advance a sect or party.
          &quot;Our denomination,&quot; it is urged, &quot;is the most
          popular—it numbers more than any other—it has more wealth.&quot;
          &quot;Our church is the most respectable—it embraces the most learned
          and talented men; therefore we are right.&quot; &quot;It will be to
          your interest to join our church, because it is THE church of whole
          region.&quot; Now all such motives as these must be classed among the
          carnal weapons. They appeal to selfishness. The true reformer makes no
          such appeals, urges no such motives, wields no such weapons: &quot;For
          the weapons of his warfare are not carnal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Such weapons are impotent, and worse than useless, in seeking to
          advance the truth. If a man becomes an honest and faithful follower of
          the truth, it must be for the truth&#x27;s sake—and not to avoid
          persecution, or reproach, or unpopularity. Such weapons can never pull
          down the strongholds of error, but rather render them more
          impregnable. Persecution will never enlighten the mind of the
          ignorant. Misrepresentation will never remove prejudice. Flattery will
          never demolish selfishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, such weapons only recoil on the heads of those who use
          them. It is an immutable decree of Jehovah, that &quot;those who take
          the sword shall perish with the sword.&quot; We have a striking
          illustration of this in the burning of Cranmer and Rogers. We have
          been taught to sympathize with them in their martyr-deaths at the
          stake; and that sympathy we would not check, for they were cruelly
          persecuted. But we would at the same time recognize in their
          sufferings a, fulfillment of Christ&#x27;s words, &quot;For in the
          same way you judge others, you will be judged; and with the measure
          you use, it will be measured to you.&quot; Matthew 7:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hands of both of them had been stained with the blood of Joan
          Boucher, a noble-minded and pious lady, who, in the reign of the
          youthful Edward, was committed to the flames for the sin of being a
          Baptist. &quot;Cranmer is said by Fox in his Book of Martyrs, to have
          been most urgent with the young king to sign to the cruel document.
          The youthful king hesitated. Cranmer argued from the law of Moses, by
          which blasphemers were to be stoned to death. With tears but
          unconvinced, the royal signature was appended. Rogers also thought
          that she ought to be put to death, and when urged with the cruelty of
          the deed, replied, &#x27;that burning alive was no cruel death, but
          easy enough!&#x27;&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          God has shown, in an unmistakable manner, his disapprobation of carnal
          weapons. While the reformer deprecates the use of these means, there
          are weapons employed by him which are &quot;mighty, through God, to
          the pulling down of strongholds.&quot; Among these we notice:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Word of God. This is the double-edged sword of the Spirit. This
          is the grand weapon which is to cut its way through all error. It
          always has been successful, and always will be. Those only have been
          successful reformers, who have used this as their great weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the Great Reformer; when he went forth to encounter, in the
          wilderness, the arch adversary of truth, how did he vanquish him?
          Though all the hosts of Heaven were ready to do his bidding, and drag
          Satan back to his prison, He disdained to exert physical force. He
          used this great weapon; and every assault of the Tempter was repelled
          by the calm reply, &quot;It is written—it is written—IT IS WRITTEN!
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostles went forth, the Word of God was the instrument with
          which they overcame the opposition of Judaism.
        </p>
        <p>
          What gave rise to the reformation in the sixteenth century? Why, a
          poor monk found a Bible, and in his cell made it his study. Happy
          would it have been for the world, if the reformers of that age had
          been guided exclusively by its holy precepts. Discarding tradition,
          and every human invention—the thorough religious reformer makes the
          Bible both his text-book and test-book.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Candor and Affection. He takes pains to ascertain accurately the
          views of those whose errors he would correct, giving them credit for
          the truth they hold, and acknowledging their excellencies wherever
          they exist. His work is not to destroy their lives, their liberties,
          or their reputations, but their errors. He therefore speaks the truth
          in love, and seeks not theirs but them. His great wish is to benefit
          them; and, like the blessed Redeemer, who could mingle His tears of
          compassion with his denunciations against sin—the reformer boldly and
          sternly denounces error, yet cherishes ardent affection for those who
          are &quot;out of the way.&quot; He also employs,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Sound Reason. He appeals not to passion or prejudice, but to the
          understanding. He is able to give a reason for everything he attempts.
          He shows the fitness of things, and their propriety; he invites the
          exercise of the judgment of those whom he addresses. Instead of
          regarding men as brutes, who are to be driven by force, he recognizes
          them as rational, intelligent beings, who are to be convinced, and
          persuaded, and moved by mental and moral power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ and the apostles were great reasoners; especially is this true
          of the apostle Paul. Who can read the epistles to the early churches,
          without being struck with the force of his reasoning? The advocates of
          error cannot stand before the reformer who is well skilled in the use
          of this weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Earnest, believing, importunate prayer. &quot;Mighty through
          God.&quot; He must give success in the use of the weapons. The
          religious reformer, therefore, while he wields the &quot;sword of the
          Spirit&quot; and exhibits in his own life the power of the truth he
          holds, depends only on God for success in his work. He pleads for men
          with God, while he pleads with men for the truth. Every successful
          religious reformer has been a man of prayer. Earnestness in the
          pulpit, has not accomplished so much as earnestness in the closet.
          With a deep conviction that it is God&#x27;s work he is endeavoring to
          advance, he confidently looks up for God&#x27;s aid and blessing in
          prosecuting it, and feels assured that while his weapons are not
          carnal, they are yet &quot;mighty through God&quot; to the pulling
          down of strongholds.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the weapons of the reformer. With these he goes forth to
          attack the strongholds of sin, and raze to the ground the giant fabric
          of error. To be successful even in advancing the truth, we must use
          only the divinely appointed means; for wherever the opposite course
          has been pursued, the most disastrous results have followed. Truth is
          only trammeled and retarded by the use of any but the heaven-approved
          weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          These weapons, only, have been used by Baptists. They have never
          figured on the historic page as persecutors. Though the subjects of
          bitter oppression and cruel persecutions themselves, it has been their
          glory always to exclaim, &quot;The weapons of our warfare are not
          carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
          strongholds!&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >The First Feature of the Reform at Which Baptists Aim: The
            Exaltation of the Word of God above Tradition</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;You have made the commandment of God of no effect by your
          tradition.&quot; Matthew 15:6
        </p>
        <p>
          Every reform in religion presupposes the existence of errors, evil in
          their tendencies and results, which have gradually crept into
          ecclesiastical organizations, and which need to be removed in order
          that such organizations may become pure and scriptural. A reform is
          not the introduction of a new system of religion, but rather the
          revival of the old system, and the assertion of its supremacy over the
          innovations of men. It is not a movement based on the pretended
          reception of a new revelation, conflicting with previous ones from an
          unchanging Jehovah, but it is the enforcement of the commands and
          precepts which have already been revealed, but which have been
          obscured, and invalidated, and made of no effect by human tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it was with the Great Reform introduced by Jesus Christ. He
          declared that he came &quot;not to destroy the law, but to fulfill
          it.&quot; In the prosecution of his mission, he utterly disregarded
          the religious rites which owed their origin to mere human invention,
          and, by a studied non-observance of the traditions of the Jewish
          elders, he constantly exhibited his disapprobation of them. At the
          same time, he taught principles, which, if carried out, would restore
          the supremacy of God&#x27;s law, and effectually remove every vestige
          of this usurpation of authority by man.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course brought down upon him the displeasure of those who were
          wedded to the rites of tradition, while they neglected the more
          important commands of God. They therefore came to expostulate with him
          in reference to the course pursued by him, saying, &quot;Why do your
          disciples transgress the traditions of the elders?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jesus, in reply, asked them a far more pertinent and weighty
          question: &quot;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by
          your tradition?&quot; And then, after citing a case in point, he
          charged them, in the words of the text, with making void the law of
          God, by substituting their unscriptural observances for his divine
          commands: &quot;Thus have you made the commandment of God of no effect
          by your tradition.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There exists today a body of Christians, who are laboring to effect
          the same kind of reforrn as that in which the blessed Savior was
          engaged, more than eighteen hundred years ago. That body, though
          designated since the days of Christ by various names, is known, at the
          present time, by the name of Baptists. The theme of this, and several
          succeeding Lectures will be: The distinguishing features of that
          reform in which Baptists are engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many persons suppose, that the only difference between Baptists and
          other evangelical denominations, is respecting the mode and subjects
          of baptism. This is, indeed, the principal external difference; but
          this difference exhibits the adherence, on the part of Baptists, to a
          great and important principle, which is involved in their action, and
          which they believe to be violated by those who differ from them in
          this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          An illustration of their position is found in the text and its
          connection. The washing of a person&#x27;s hands before eating, was,
          in itself, a small matter; but it involved, in this instance, a sinful
          obtruding of human tradition in the place of divine commands. This is
          just the principle that is involved in the practice of infant baptism.
          We announce, then, as the First Feature of the reform in which
          Baptists are engaged,
        </p>
        <p>
          The Exaltation of the Word of God above Tradition, in All Matters of
          Religious Duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has always been a conflict between Divine revelation and human
          tradition; and yet the advocates of the latter have almost invariably
          endeavored to reconcile it with the former, and thus the Word of God
          is often distorted in vain efforts to make it support that which is of
          merely human origin. The ultimate effect of these efforts is to divide
          the Bible against itself, and to cause it to be utterly disregarded as
          the standard of appeal in matters of religious duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was thus with the traditions of the Jewish elders. Those who
          followed them and practiced their rites, ceased to regard the
          Scriptures which they possessed as the standard of duty; they became a
          dead letter, and the tradition of the elders—not the Scriptures—was
          the authority they cited for the support of their rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;For God commanded, saying, &#x27;Honor your father and your
          mother&#x27;; and, &#x27;He who curses father or mother, let him be
          put to death.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          But you say, &#x27;Whoever says to his father or mother,
          &quot;Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to
          God&quot;—then he need not honor his father or mother.&#x27;
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your
          tradition.&quot; Matthew 15:4-6
        </p>
        <p>
          The same result followed, when the disciples listened to the voice of
          tradition. On one occasion Christ said, in reference to John, &quot;If
          I will that he tarries until I come, what is that to you?&quot;
          Tradition immediately distorted the question into an assertion:
          &quot;Then that saying went abroad among the brethren, that that
          disciple should not die.&quot; Here tradition uttered a falsehood, and
          taught as usual a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus, also, in reference to the Church of Rome. Tradition after
          tradition has been received, until it becomes dangerous to the
          interests of that church to permit her deluded members to read
          God&#x27;s Word—so directly are her traditions opposed to that Word.
          And, in order to sustain herself, she vainly arrogates to herself
          infallibility, and exalts herself above the Bible, and makes the
          commandment of God of no effect by her tradition. The will of the Pope
          and the decisions of councils, are made the standards of appeal—and
          the Bible is a dead letter. And yet this same church, in all her
          corruption, endeavors to reconcile her traditions, in some instances,
          with the Bible; but, in order to do it, she distorts and invents
          Scripture to suit herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          On what does the Papacy rest to support its penances, and
          image-worship, and prayers to the saints, and priestly absolutions,
          and, in short, its very existence? I reply in one word, Tradition! Let
          the Bible become her standard, and she would cease to exist. She has
          made almost every commandment of God of no effect by her tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is, also, with Protestant Paedobaptist churches. Tradition is
          the basis on which infant baptism rests. We look in vain for any
          command in reference to it in the Bible; the Scriptures utter not a
          word in support of it. The most able Paedobaptists have themselves
          admitted this. Says Dr. Leonard Woods, an eminent Paedobaptist:
          &quot;Whatever may have been the precepts of Christ, or his apostles,
          to those who enjoyed their personal instructions, it is plain there is
          no express precept respecting infant baptism in our sacred writings.
          The proof, then, that infant baptism is a divine institution, must be
          made out some other way.&quot; He says further: &quot;The want of an
          express, positive command of Scripture that infants should be
          baptized, is not to be considered as a valid objection against infant
          baptism.&quot; (Lectures on Infant Baptism, pages 10, 11, 17)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here plainly admitted that there is no command for infant
          baptism in the Word of God. But we do not need these admissions to
          substantiate our assertion. We simply appeal to the Bible itself. If
          it was there, we could see it for ourselves. We ask any one to show us
          the first instance of the sprinkling of an infant, or any command to
          administer baptism to infants. It cannot be found. Thousands of
          dollars have been offered for the production of a single text,
          authorizing the practice; but these premiums have never been claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          On what, then, does it rest? I reply, on TRADITION. Dr. Woods says
          that authority for it, &quot;may be afforded particularly by an
          unwritten tradition.&quot; Infant baptism is a human invention, having
          no higher authority than that of man. It is one of the traditions
          which the Protestant Reformers brought from Rome. Infant baptism is
          the main &quot;pillar&quot; on which Popery rests; for, if you take
          away the baptism of infants, Rome would soon fall. Its defense
          necessitates Romish arguments; and instances are not wanting where
          Paedobaptists in combating Romanists, have either been compelled to
          use arguments fatal to their own practices, or else be defeated. It is
          a matter of history, that Protestant arguments against Baptists have
          often been used by Romanists against Protestants themselves. A
          forcible proof of this is seen in the following extract from the Roman
          Catholic Catechism:
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: Can Protestants prove to Baptists, that the baptism of
          infants is good and useful?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: No; they cannot; because, according to Protestant principles,
          such baptism is useless.
        </p>
        <p>Question: Why do you say this?</p>
        <p>
          Answer: One of the Protestant principles is, that no human being can
          be justified except by an act of faith in Jesus Christ; but no infant
          is capable of making this act of faith; therefore, upon Protestant
          principles, the baptism of infants is useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: Can you draw the same consequence from any other principle?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: Yes; their first principle is, that nothing is to be practiced
          which is not authorized by Scriptural example; but it does not appear
          from Scripture, that even one infant was ever baptized; therefore
          Protestants should reject, on their own principle, infant baptism as
          an unscriptural usage.
        </p>
        <p>Question: How do Baptists treat other Protestants?</p>
        <p>
          Answer: They boast that the Scripture is evidently for Baptist
          practice—that other Protestants hold traditional doctrines, like the
          Catholics. They quote Matthew chapter 28: &#x27;Go teach all nations,
          baptizing them,&#x27; from which they say it is clear that teaching
          should go before baptism; hence they conclude that as infants cannot
          be taught, so neither should they be baptized, until they are capable
          of teaching or instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: What use do they make of Mark, chapter 10: &#x27;He who
          believes and is baptized shall be saved?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: They say it is evident that belief or faith must precede
          baptism; but they add infants are not capable of believing; therefore
          neither are they capable of being baptized.
        </p>
        <p>Question: What can Protestants reply to this Baptist reasoning?</p>
        <p>
          Answer: They may give these passages another meaning; but they can
          never prove that their interpretation is better than that of the
          Baptists, because they themselves give every one a right to interpret
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: How do Catholics prove that infants ought to be baptized?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: Not from Scripture alone, which is not very clear on this
          subject, but from the Scripture illustrated by the constant tradition
          of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: Can Protestants use this argument of tradition against the
          Baptists?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: No; they have no right to use it in this matter, where it
          would serve them, since they reject it in every question where it is
          opposed to their novel and lately invented doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Says the President of the famous Council of Trent, a Roman Catholic
          Cardinal, speaking of the Baptists: &quot;And surely, how many soever
          have written against this heresy, whether they were Catholics or
          Reformers, they were able to overthrow it, not so much by the
          testimony of the Scriptures, as by the authority of the Church.&quot;
          And Bayle, in his Critical Dictionary, says that the Protestants were
          obliged to meet the Baptists with arguments which were turned against
          them by the papists. Dr. Woods furnishes us an illustration of this
          assertion. He says: &quot;It is unquestionable, that the knowledge of
          some extraordinary events of providence, or of some divine
          injunctions, may be as truly and as certainly communicated in this
          way, [by an unwritten tradition,] as in others; and we should in many
          cases, consider a man who should refuse to admit the truth and
          authority of a tradition, to be as unreasonable, as if he should
          refuse to admit the authority of written or printed records.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I ask if this is not giving up to Rome all she claims? &quot;We
          should consider a man who should refuse to admit the authority of
          tradition, to be as unreasonable as if he should refuse to admit the
          authority of written or printed records!&quot; Will not Popery
          heartily endorse this doctrine?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now on what kind of traditionary authority does infant baptism rest?
          Why, upon the same as every other corruption of Rome; and if Romish
          tradition be followed in this case, why not in all others? Thus, we
          have shown that infant baptism requires Romish arguments. Now, the
          simple reason of this is, that, like the other rites of Popery, it is
          founded in tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the commandment of God is made of none effect by this
          tradition. God has given express and plain commands, in reference to
          every duty and ordinance. He has commanded believers to be baptized;
          He has extended the command to none others. Those baptized in infancy,
          in a multitude of cases, grow up in unbelief, and never become
          believers. But where they do become converts, they are taught, by the
          tradition of the church, that their infant baptism is sufficient, and
          they are not expected to be baptized after believing. And even when
          persons sprinkled in infancy are led, by the study of the Bible, to
          desire baptism after they have believed, strong efforts are always
          made to dissuade them from it, and they are often compelled to go to
          the Baptists in order to be baptized. These things are of such common
          occurrence, that it is unnecessary to relate instances in proof. Thus
          the Word of God is made of no effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Paedobaptists, like the Jewish elders, endeavor to reconcile
          their tradition with the Word of God. Look at their reasoning:
          &quot;Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift by
          whatever you might be profited by me, and honor not his father or his
          mother, he shall be free.&quot; Paedobaptists say: &quot;If any
          persons be sprinkled in infancy, and be not baptized after they
          believe, it is sufficient.&quot; There is an exact parallel. Here you
          perceive the reasonings of men, in both instances, though opposed to
          the express command of God, are made the standard, instead of his
          Word. Would it not sound strange to hear a Paedobaptist minister urge
          his people to simply follow the teaching and example of Christ, in
          reference to baptism? Yet this is right; but this comes directly in
          contact with their tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Baptists are opposed to tradition, anywhere and everywhere;
          whether they find it in the Church of Rome, or in Protestant churches.
          They aim to elevate the Word of God above tradition, as the standard
          of duty in all places. It is professedly the grand doctrine of
          Protestantism, which Protestants themselves have abandoned—that
          Baptists steadily maintain. They aim to bring all to this standard.
          They, themselves, have always adhered to the Bible. Did anyone ever
          hear of Baptists being charged with following tradition? The charge
          would be ridiculously absurd; for they have always opposed tradition
          as a guide in matters of religious duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these remarks, it will be perceived, that while the subjects and
          mode of baptism is the external ground of difference between Baptists
          and others, that difference involves a great principle; and the
          primary question is not, Shall infants be baptized? But, whether
          God&#x27;s Word or tradition shall be our guide. God has uttered his
          will in the matter. That will we follow, as we find it in his Word.
          Those who oppose us, by their own showing, follow tradition. We are
          laboring to effect a reform. In doing so we refer all to the Bible. We
          assert its supremacy above all human teaching, our own, as well as
          that of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is a prominent feature of the reform in which Baptists are
          engaged. And I observe it is most important and necessary. Especially
          is it necessary,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In COMBATING ERROR. If tradition is allowed in one particular, who
          will prohibit it in another? Romanism is gaining ground in this
          country; it is a religion of tradition. Who will oppose it? Those who
          are themselves trammeled by tradition? To every argument, they can
          retort, as they have done, &quot;Where do you get your infant
          baptism?&quot; The most staunch Romanist asks nothing more than the
          adoption of the principle, contained in the language already quoted,
          of a Protestant Paedobaptist in support of infant baptism: &quot;We
          should consider a man who should refuse to admit the truth and
          authority of tradition, to be as unreasonable as if he should refuse
          to admit the truth, of written or printed records.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          No Paedobaptist can consistently oppose Romanism. There is no
          consistent position between the Romish and the Baptist church.
          Tradition leads to the one—the Word of God to the other. Infidelity
          and Rationalism, also, are rearing their heads in our midst, and who
          shall meet them? Their cry is, &quot;Priestcraft, and ministerial
          dictation!&quot; Who shall meet them? Those who allow their ministers
          to tell them what to believe, and to dictate whether they shall
          investigate a subject or not? No! but those who are prepared, by an
          independent investigation, and a manly appeal to the Bible, to show
          the falsity of their charges. This feature of reform is necessary,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To the PURITY OF THE CHURCH. No organization can be pure, without a
          pure standard. Tradition is liable to perversion; there is no
          certainty about it. Today it assumes one position, tomorrow an
          opposite one. Thus it has ever been. The Church of Rome, though
          claiming infallibility, has constantly changed her ground of action,
          because governed by the variable standard of tradition. This is no
          less true of Protestant Paedobaptism. Today, infants are sprinkled on
          one ground; tomorrow that ground is abandoned, and another, directly
          opposite to it, is urged, as a reason for administering the rite.
          Anon, both these are abandoned, and a new position, with a new set of
          arguments is introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is strikingly illustrated in the experience of Simon Menno, a
          Romish priest, who in 1580 was converted to Christ and to Baptist
          sentiments, by reading the New Testament. He says:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I examined the Scriptures with diligence and meditated on them
          earnestly, but could find in them no authority for infant baptism. As
          I remarked this, I spoke of it to my pastor, and after several
          conversations he acknowledged that infant baptism had no ground in the
          Scriptures. Yet I dare not trust so much to my understanding. I
          consulted some ancient authors, who taught me that children must, by
          baptism, be washed from their original sin. This I compared with the
          Scriptures and perceived that it set at naught the blood of Christ.
          Afterward I went to Luther, and would gladly have known from him the
          ground; and he taught me that we must baptize children on their own
          faith, because they are holy. This also I saw was not according to
          God&#x27;s Word. In the third place I went to Brucer, who taught me
          that we should baptize children in order to be able the more
          diligently to take care of them, and bring them up in the ways of the
          Lord. But, this too, I saw, was a groundless representation. In the
          fourth place I had recourse to Bullinger, who pointed me to the
          covenant of circumcision; but I found as before, that, according to
          Scripture, the practice could not stand. As I now on every side
          observed that the writers stood on grounds so very different, and each
          followed his own reason, I saw clearly that we were deceived with
          infant baptism.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Can the church be pure with such a contradictory guide as tradition?
          Never!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I inquire, Does the charge of the text lie against any of my
          Christian brethren? If you have neglected baptism since you believed,
          because you were sprinkled in infancy, it most assuredly does. Your
          infant baptism rests on tradition. The Bible says, &quot;He who
          believes and is baptized, shall be saved.&quot; &quot;Repent and be
          baptized, every one of you.&quot; If, because sprinkled in infancy,
          you refuse now to obey Christ, we say to you, in His own truthful
          language, &quot;Thus have you made the commandment of God of no effect
          by your tradition!&quot;
        </p>

            Restoration of the Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom</em

        <p>&quot;My kingdom is not of this world&quot; John 18:36</p>
        <p>
          There was much misapprehension, during the ministry of Christ on the
          earth, concerning the nature of that kingdom which he was about to
          establish. It was most generally supposed, that it would be a temporal
          kingdom, differing from others only in its superior external splendor,
          its brilliant warlike achievements, and its universal extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this false idea, that so perplexed Herod, at the announcement
          of the birth of the infant Savior. It was this false idea that led the
          Jews to reject their Messiah, when he appeared among them in the
          character of the meek and lowly One. It was this false idea that led
          the disciples, just before the ascension of Christ, to ask,
          &quot;Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to
          Israel?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The principles to which the Savior gave utterance, were calculated to
          remove these false impressions from the minds of all who had imbibed
          them. He taught his followers to nourish a spirit of self-denial, and
          humility, and peace. Every act of his life, and every word of his
          lips, bore testimony to the fact that he came not to set up an earthly
          empire, but a spiritual kingdom. And when he uttered the words of the
          text, &quot;My kingdom is not of this world,&quot; he simply gave an
          exposition of the principles he had been teaching during his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostles were enlightened by the Holy Spirit on the day of
          Pentecost, they understood perfectly the nature of this declaration;
          and hence, they admitted none to visible membership in the gospel
          kingdom but those who gave evidence of repentance, and faith in
          Christ. They taught that the church of which Jesus is the Head, was a
          spiritual organization, composed not of those who came into it by
          hereditary descent, but of those who were born of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, there has been a departure from these principles; and
          organizations now exist, under the designation of Christian churches,
          which aim to unite the church and the world, and introduce the
          impious, and ungodly, and profane, into Christ&#x27;s kingdom—thus
          reversing his declaration, that his &quot;kingdom is not of this
          world.&quot; Against this innovation Baptists strenuously protest. We
          announce, then, as the Second Feature of the reform in which Baptists
          are engaged,
        </p>
        <p>The Restoration of the Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom.</p>
        <p>
          Let us inquire here, How is it, that the principle expressed in the
          text came to be violated? How does it happen, that others than those
          possessing the qualifications demanded by the Gospel, come to have a
          place in Christ&#x27;s professedly visible kingdom? How does it
          happen, that what is professedly Christ&#x27;s church, is the
          receptacle of the godless and the vile? I reply, simply through the
          introduction of the unscriptural rite of infant baptism!
        </p>
        <p>
          So long as the church followed the direction of her Lord, and baptized
          into her membership only those who gave evidence of faith—so long she
          retained her spirituality; but when she permitted tradition to add to
          the Word of God, and received into her membership infants, who grew up
          in sin and unbelief—then her spirituality was exchanged for
          worldliness; then she introduced a traitor into the citadel, who
          betrayed her into the hands of her enemies. In contending, then, for
          the baptism of believers only, we aim at the restoration of the
          principle expressed by the Savior in the words of the text: &quot;My
          kingdom is not of this world.&quot; I shall endeavor to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That Infant Baptism tends to the Violation of this Principle. It is
          an undeniable fact, that all Paedobaptist churches have contended that
          infants are proper subjects for membership in the church, and
          therefore should be baptized. There are two opinions, however, as to
          the grounds of infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some contend that the infants of professed believers should be
          baptized because they are already members of the church, by their
          natural birth. Others contend that they should be baptized in order to
          make them members. All Paedobaptists, however, agree, that infants are
          proper subjects for church membership, and by baptism they receive
          such to their membership. This is true, not only of the Church of
          Rome, but of all the Protestant Paedobaptist denominations, as can
          easily be shown by their Confessions of Faith and writings on the
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Episcopal minister, at the baptism of an infant, says: &quot;We
          receive this child into the congregation of Christ&#x27;s flock.&quot;
          And again: &quot;Seeing that this child is regenerate, and grafted
          into the body of Christ&#x27;s church.&quot; And in the prayer he
          thanks God that it has pleased him &quot;to regenerate this infant,
          and incorporate him into his holy church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The 17th article of the Methodist Episcopal Church says: &quot;Baptism
          is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
          Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized, but it
          is also a sign of regeneration, or the new birth. The baptism of young
          children is to be retained in the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Confession of Faith, chapter 25 section 2 says:
          &quot;The visible church consists of all those throughout the world
          that profess the true religion, together with their children.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told again in the Westminster Larger Catechism, question 165,
          that &quot;Baptism is a sacrament,&quot; &quot;whereby the parties
          baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible church.&quot;
          &quot;All baptized persons are members of the church, are under its
          care, and subject to its government and discipline, and when they have
          arrived at years of discretion, they are bound to perform all the
          duties of church members.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the doctrine of all Paedobaptist denominations. Those baptized
          in infancy are considered as sustaining the relation of church
          members. The propriety of this relation is urged in every possible
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Says one writer, &quot;Infants may be the disciples of Christ. A
          disciple is a scholar; this is the meaning of the word. And a child is
          a scholar before he learns his lesson, as well as afterwards. He is
          reckoned a scholar when he is committed to the care of the instructor,
          or has his name put down with those who belong to the school whether
          he puts his name down himself, or whether his parents put it down for
          him. The church is the school of Christ. The names of all those to
          whom God&#x27;s gracious covenant [baptism] is applied, belong upon
          the records of the church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is plainly taught that infants, by their baptism, are not only
          admitted into the church, but actually made disciples of Christ.
          Surely, Mr. Arnold had forgotten what Christ said, when he wrote the
          above: &quot;If any man will be MY disciple, let him deny himself, and
          take up his cross, and follow me.&quot; However, I did not introduce
          this extract to combat it in this place, but simply to show that
          Paedobaptists contend for infant membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another writer says: &quot;This relation of children to the church is
          generally represented, by the most respectable authors, as infant
          membership. Against this I can see no valid objections. In a very
          important, though in a very qualified sense, baptized children may be
          considered as infant members of the Christian church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Says Dr. McDowell: &quot;By baptism children become members of
          Christ&#x27;s visible church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          From these quotations, (and they might be increased indefinitely) it
          will be clearly seen that infants become members of Paedobaptist
          churches by baptism; and these infants are the constituent elements of
          which these churches are composed. Having thus been admitted members
          in infancy, they retain their connection with the church after they
          are grown up, however wicked and abandoned they may become. Though
          they are sometimes guilty of such vile crimes as to merit their
          exclusion from society, and their confinement in the penitentiary,
          still they are not excluded from the church. And though they sometimes
          die under the hand of the public executioner, without any evidence of
          repentance, they die as members of the church into which they were
          baptized. Is not this uniting the church and the world &quot;until
          death does them part?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these remarks apply, more particularly, to national
          churches—all of which are Paedobaptist—as the Romish, Greek, Lutheran
          and English Episcopal, who all receive and retain infant members,
          however wicked they may become, yet the same is true, in some sense of
          all other Paedobaptist churches. Dr. Woods, speaking of the duty of
          the church to its infant members, says: &quot;On the question whether
          the church ever ought, by a public act, to cut off those who give
          evidence of obstinate impiety, there have been various opinions.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is, in my view, utterly inexpedient to attempt to fix upon
          any particular age, at which those who were baptized in infancy, and
          who exhibit no evidence of piety, are to be abandoned by the church,
          as those for whom no further efforts are to be made. For, suppose you
          fix upon the age of eighteen, or twenty, or twenty-one; who can be
          sure that a youth at that age though without any evidence of
          regeneration, may not be in a state of mind which is more susceptible
          of good impressions, and which affords more hope of salvation, than at
          any period of his life before? Now if any person should be in this
          state, and the church should adopt a principle like what I have
          referred to, they must forthwith exclude such a person from all the
          advantages of their Christian friendship; and they must do this at a
          time when those advantages would be most highly prized.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We are not to attend to present appearances; but are to consider
          the forbearance and longsuffering of God, and the multiplied instances
          in which His grace has visited those who had long lived in sin, and
          who, in human apprehension, had been fitted for destruction. And when
          those who have been devoted to God in baptism, wander far and long
          from the path of duty, and show fearful symptoms of obduracy—we are
          not quickly to despair of their salvation, but are to follow them with
          every effort which the sincerest love can dictate. And when no other
          effort seems to promise any good, we are to abound in prayer, relying
          on the infinite grace of God, and earnestly hoping that our prayers
          will prevail and that our children will at length be persuaded to
          consider their ways, and turn to the Lord.&quot; (Lectures on Infant
          Baptism, pages 173-175.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From this it will be perceived that those who are made members of
          Paedobaptist churches in infancy continue such when grown up—that they
          are not to be excluded no matter how ungodly they become, so long as
          hopes may be entertained of their conversion; or, in other words, so
          long as they live. This, we know, is the practice of Paedobaptists
          universally. Is not this uniting the church and the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let it be remembered, that I have thus far confined my remarks to
          the effects of infant membership where only the children of
          professedly pious parents are admitted into the church by their
          baptism in infancy. How much more palpable does this evil appear, when
          we extend our observation to the practice which exists, to a, greater
          or less extent, in almost every Paedobaptist community—of baptizing
          the children of unconverted parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of Paedobaptists do not require piety as a condition in
          the parents, but simply a desire to have their children baptized.
          There is nothing in the standards of any Paedobaptist church that
          actually prohibits the baptism of children of unconverted parents. The
          Presbyterian Confession of Faith appears to prescribe limits, but it
          does not actually do so, nor is it so understood by the ministry of
          that church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Says Dr. McDowell, &quot;Seeing that a person by baptism has become a
          member of the visible church, although destitute of piety, and
          although he gives the church no evidence of visible piety, yet on what
          ground, or in what way can he be kept back from baptism for his child?
          I answer, let him be seriously and solemnly told the nature of
          baptism,&quot; etc. &quot; If this were properly done, it would have a
          great effect in keeping back many improper persons.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I might, if it were necessary, furnish instances where Presbyterian
          ministers have baptized the children of unconverted parents without
          the least hesitation. But the worst feature of all is, that in some
          cases unconverted persons are urged to bring their children to
          baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, however, that in all cases, none but the children of truly
          pious parents were admitted to infant baptism and membership—would
          this remove the evil? Are such children any better than others? No;
          for like all others, they are born with carnal and depraved natures.
          They are of the world—they belong to it; and notwithstanding their
          religious parentage, they are &quot;children of wrath even as
          others,&quot; until regenerated by the Holy Spirit. As they advance
          toward maturity, they exhibit the same enmity to God, and the same
          evil passions, and the same sinful inclinations manifested by others.
          Some of them become notoriously vile, yet they are not to be excluded;
          but they retain their membership, into which they were brought in
          their infancy, and continue in it to the day of their death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is directly opposed to Christ&#x27;s declaration: &quot;My
          kingdom is not of this world.&quot; It is directly opposed to the
          practice of the apostles. It is directly opposed to the New Testament
          description of church members. They are there described as a spiritual
          seed, living stones, saints, sincere believers. But are baptized
          infants of this description? Do they possess the qualities which in
          the New Testament are invariably ascribed to church members? By no
          means. And yet they are received into what are professedly evangelical
          churches; and thus the spirituality of Christ&#x27;s kingdom has been
          destroyed by infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The church of Christ, bought with his blood, and ordained by him
          to be the fold of his sheep, the home of the renewed, in the world but
          not of it—has been robbed of its true design, by being converted into
          a common receptacle for the pure and the impure—a great drag-net,
          inclosing all alike.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Infant baptism tends directly to amalgamate the church with the world.
          It is by means of this, that the church of Rome has spread her baneful
          influence over so many nations. This is abundantly evident from the
          fact, that through the baptism of children she has made whole nations
          nominally Christian, teaching just what all other churches who baptize
          infants teach, that by their baptism they are made members of the
          church of Christ. Thus do Protestant Paedobaptists indorse the false
          teachings of Rome, and give their strength to the Beast, by propping
          up the main pillar on which Antichrist rests! I proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the practice of Baptists is in accordance with the teachings
          of Christ. Baptists regard the kingdom of Christ as a purely spiritual
          organization, separate and distinct from the world. Acting upon this
          conviction, they admit none to baptism and membership, but such as
          profess their faith in Jesus, and give satisfactory evidence that they
          have &quot;passed from death unto life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They recognize no hereditary claims to the covenant of grace. They
          claim no &quot;holiness&quot; for their offspring, arising from their
          natural birth, which entitles them to a place in God&#x27;s spiritual
          temple. But regarding them as carnal, depraved and unholy, they
          constantly feel the importance of urging upon them their own personal
          obligations to &quot;repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus
          Christ,&quot; while infant damnation has no place in their creed, for
          the simple reason that, like infant baptism, its supposed antidote, it
          is not found in the Bible. They aim to show that Christ&#x27;s
          &quot;kingdom is not of this world.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They receive none but professed converts, and when these walk
          disorderly, they withdraw themselves from them. They are laboring to
          reform both Protestant and Papal Christendom on this point, which they
          regard of vital importance to the best interests of the church and the
          world. Let their principles prevail, and there can be no unhallowed
          union of Church and State, no amalgamation of Christ&#x27;s kingdom
          with the world; but the Church, with undimmed luster will shine forth,
          her glory unobscured, her ordinances uncorrupted, and her membership
          uncontaminated, and instead of being &quot;the mistress of the State,
          or the courtesan of the world—as Paedobaptism has in too many
          instances made her—she will appear in all her loveliness as the Bride
          of Christ!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          From these remarks it will be seen, that infant baptism is not that
          harmless, innocent thing which many suppose it to be. Infant baptism
          is the parent of gigantic evils; the fruitful source of the existence
          of state churches, and most of the corruptions flowing therefrom; the
          instigator of all the persecutions which have ever been waged in the
          name of Christianity; a lying refuge and hiding-place of falsehood to
          ensnare and ruin souls. In short, infant baptism is the originator and
          propagator of Popery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infant baptism is an error from beginning to end—corrupt in theory and
          corrupting in practice; born in superstition, cradled in fear, nursed
          in ignorance, supported by fraud, and spread by force! With a tyrant
          hand it has shed the blood of martyrs in torrents in all lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The introduction of infant baptism was the death-knell of religions
          liberty in the Christian communities where it was practiced. The first
          persecutions ever raised in the name of Christianity, were waged by
          the advocates of infant baptism against those who, adhering to the
          teachings of Christ and the apostles, denied its validity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The council of Carthage (A.D. 414) passed the following canon:
          &quot;Whoever denies that little children by baptism are freed from
          perdition and eternally saved—that they are accursed.&quot; The edict
          of Honorius and Valentinian III. (A.D. 418) forbids re-baptism
          throughout the Roman empire under the penalty of death. This of course
          was aimed at those who considered infant baptism as unscriptural, and
          immersed believers after they had confessed their faith in Christ,
          even though they had been baptized in infancy. Justinian, in the
          beginning of the sixth century, ordered new-born infants to be
          baptized, under a penalty for neglecting it. Under laws like these,
          enforced as they were in the middle ages with new and most bloody
          edicts in all the states of Europe, what multitudes must have become
          martyrs, may be conjectured from the fact that at the time of the
          Reformation, Baptist martyrs were counted by tens and even hundreds of
          thousands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as we love the Word of God, the commands and example of Christ,
          the purity of the Christian Church, and the souls of men—we are bound
          unceasingly to labor for the extermination of this monster evil, this
          child of Tradition! In seeking to effect this reform, we shall use no
          carnal weapons, but simply adhere to the word of God, the precepts of
          Christ, and the practice of the apostles—and urge all others to do the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me urge all to seek from the Bible a knowledge of the
          characteristics of those who composed the primitive churches, and see
          whether they will apply to the constituents of Paedobaptist churches.
          And if not, then &quot;come out from among them,&quot; and aid those
          who are laboring to effect a reform which will restore the
          spirituality of the church, and clothe it with that moral beauty and
          attractiveness of which Paedobaptism has shorn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding this lecture, I cannot refrain from saying a few words
          to those who have been baptized in infancy, and are yet conscious that
          they have never been &quot;born again.&quot; I am induced to do this,
          because I am reminded that my attention was first led to a open
          investigation of the subject of baptism, by discovering that, though
          unconverted, I was a member of the church—having been made so by my
          baptism in infancy. This incongruous position you sustain. Though in
          the world, and of the world—you are also in the church, and of the
          church! You are not responsible, I am aware, for the inconsistency of
          the position you occupy. You were brought into it while in unconscious
          infancy, without your knowledge and consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I inquire, do you not feel that such a relation is perfectly
          inconsistent with your own ideas of what the Bible teaches? A
          moment&#x27;s reflection, I feel confident, if you are really
          Protestants, will convince you of it. At all events, I urge you, as
          Protestants, to search the Bible in reference to this matter, with the
          hope that you may be led, as I was, to see your unfitness for a place
          in Christ&#x27;s kingdom, and to seek and obtain salvation through
          Jesus Christ, and then act consistently, by uniting with those who aim
          to restore the spirituality of Christ&#x27;s church, by faithfully
          adhering to his own declaration, &quot;My kingdom is not of this
          world.&quot;

          &quot;Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we
          forbade him, because he follows not with us. And Jesus said, Forbid
          him not.&quot; Luke 9:49, 50
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gospel of Christ not only differs from all other systems of
          religion in the superior excellence of the truths it reveals, but also
          in the directions it gives for the propagation of its doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other systems seek to advance themselves by invoking the aid of the
          secular power, and by forcing men, against their convictions, to
          accept a theory repugnant to their views. They have thus succeeded in
          thronging their temples with hypocritical worshipers, bound to their
          altars through fear and slavish dread. These systems, in order to
          maintain themselves, find it necessary to proscribe and persecute all
          who differ from them, either in their articles of belief or mode of
          worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Gospel of Christ, though it is the infallible truth of God,
          expressly prohibits a resort to any such measures for its advancement.
          It not only teaches its adherents to utterly abandon the use of carnal
          weapons for its propagation, but it also charges them not to proscribe
          to those who may differ in their views or mode of worship. This
          principle is directly expressed in the text and its connection. The
          teaching of the Savior has been violated, however, even by his
          professed followers; and, in the name of the meek and lowly Jesus, men
          have gone forth with proscription, oppression, and persecution, to
          advance their own opinions, and crush out that liberty of thought, and
          those rights of conscience given to man by his Maker, and the free
          exercise of which is alone compatible with his personal
          accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          One body of Christians has always shunned this mode of procedure; and
          in seeking to advance the truth, they have never engaged in
          persecution of any kind, though they have been themselves more
          bitterly persecuted than any others. I propose to prove that Baptists
          have always been the pioneers in the Propagation of Religious Liberty
          and the Rights of Conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavor here to define what religious liberty is. The views
          of many Protestants, even in this land of liberty, are exceedingly
          imperfect, and in some instances surprisingly erroneous, on this
          subject. Many consider toleration as synonymous with religious
          liberty; but a moment&#x27;s consideration will exhibit the vast
          difference between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toleration is the allowance of that which is not wholly approved. As
          applied to religion, the term is objectionable; because it presupposes
          the existence of some mere human authority, which has power to grant
          to, or withhold from man the exercise of freedom in matters of
          religion—and this is Popery. Our Creator, however, has nowhere
          delegated such authority to king, or priest, or any human organization
          whatever; on the contrary, he has shown, by the very nature of the
          soul of man, and the Revelation given to him, that it is his
          inalienable right to exercise his judgment without restraint in
          religious matters, and give expression, freely and fully, to his
          religious convictions, without human coercion or interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is manifest, that if the right to tolerate exists in man, the right
          to prohibit, and to dictate to the conscience, must also exist with
          it; and thus toleration becomes merely another name for oppression.
          Toleration, therefore, is not religious liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Religious freedom recognizes in no human organization the right or the
          power to tolerate. It does not stoop—either to magistrate or minister,
          pope or priest—to humbly beg permission to speak freely, or act out
          its convictions; but it speaks and acts, because, in the exercise of
          its own right, it chooses to do so. It simply asks, with Paul,
          &quot;Lord, what will you have me to do?&quot; and having ascertained
          God&#x27;s will, it goes forth to do it, though a host of priests, or
          a thousand executioners, stand ready to execrate and slay it. It
          acknowledges no human authority competent to come between the
          conscience and its Maker in reference to his will and its duty.
          Religious liberty does not exist where there is no recognition and
          acknowledgment of this right—the right of every individual of the
          human race, to think, and choose, and act for himself in religious
          matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptists have always strenuously contended for the acknowledgment of
          this principle, and have labored to propagate it. Nowhere, on the page
          of history, can an instance be found of Baptists depriving others of
          their religious liberties, or aiming to do so; but, wherever they are
          found, even in the darkest ages of intolerance and persecution, they
          appear to be far in advance of those who surround them on this
          important subject. This is simply owing to their adherence to the
          Gospel of Christ in its purity. Here religious liberty is taught in
          its fullest extent; and it was only when the Christian church departed
          from God&#x27;s Word, that she sought to crush the rights of
          conscience; and only when she fully returns to it again, will she
          cease to nourish a desire to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Reformation which took place in the sixteenth century, while it
          aimed to remove many of the abuses of Popery, still did not recognize
          religions liberty. &quot;There is not a confession of faith, nor a
          creed,&quot; says Underhill, &quot;framed by any of the Reformers,
          which does not give to the magistrate a coercive power in religion,
          and almost every one, at the same time, curses the resisting
          Baptist.&quot; &quot;It was the crime of this persecuted people, that
          they rejected secular interference in the church of God; it was the
          boast and aim of the Reformers everywhere to employ it. The natural
          fruit of the one was persecution—of the other, liberty.&quot;
          (&quot;Struggles and Triumphs of Religious Liberty,&quot; page 86.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Baptists stood entirely alone, as the defenders of the rights of
          conscience. All the Reformed communities agreed that it was right for
          the magistrate to punish those who did not worship according to the
          prescribed rule of their churches; and it was for opposition to this
          feature of religious oppression, in connection with their adherence to
          believer&#x27;s baptism, that brought upon the Baptists those severe
          persecutions which they were called to endure. They contended for
          religious liberty; the Reformed churches opposed it, and committed
          themselves to a course fatal to the rights of conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I again quote from Underhill: &quot;Honor, ease, and wealth flowed in
          upon the opposers of religious liberty, but tribulation unto death was
          the portion of those who ventured to advocate it. Most affectingly
          does the eminent Simmon Menno refer to this contrast: &#x27;For
          eighteen years, with my poor feeble wife and little children, has it
          behooved me to bear great and various sufferings, griefs, afflictions,
          miseries, and persecutions, and in every place to find a bare
          existence, in fear and danger of my life. While some preachers are
          reclining on their soft bed and downy pillows—we are often hidden in
          the caves of the earth. While they are celebrating the nuptial or
          natal days of their children, and rejoicing with the timbrel and the
          harp—we are looking anxiously about, fearing lest persecutors should
          be suddenly at the door earth. While they are saluted by all around as
          doctors, masters, lords, we are compelled to hear ourselves called
          Anabaptists, ale-house preachers, seducers, heretics, and to be hailed
          in the devil&#x27;s name. In a word, while they for their ministry are
          remunerated with annual stipends, our wages are the fire, the sword,
          the death.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, why was this? Did these Baptists deserve such treatment at the
          hands of their persecutors? Let a Catholic historian (Cardinal Hosius,
          President of the Council of Trent) reply: &quot;If you behold their
          cheerfulness in suffering persecution, the Anabaptists run before all
          the heretics. If you have regard to the number, it is like that in
          multitude they would swarm above all others, if they were not
          grievously plagued and cut off with the knife of persecution. If you
          have an eye to the outward appearance of godliness, both the Lutherans
          and Zwinglians must needs grant that they far pass them. If you will
          be moved by the boasting of the Word of God, these be no less bold
          than Calvin to preach, and their doctrine must stand aloft above all
          the glory of the world, must stand invincible above all power, because
          it is not their word, but the Word of the living God.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident, then, that the Baptists suffered merely because they
          maintained that they ought &quot;to obey God rather than man.&quot;
          They found no direction in the Bible for the baptism of infants, and
          therefore they refused to observe the rite. The Reformed or Protestant
          churches sought to force them to do it, in opposition to their
          convictions. They maintained that this was also contrary to the spirit
          of the Gospel, and thus, in defense of the Bible, and the rights of
          conscience, they died.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a proof of this let me give you one among very many other instances
          which might be produced. Balthazar Hubmeyer of Friedburgh,
          Switzerland, who with his wife, suffered martyrdom in 1598, at the
          hands of the Protestant Reformers, for the sin of being a Baptist—was
          originally a learned and eloquent Roman Catholic preacher, and while
          among them was called a Doctor of the Holy Scriptures. By the
          illumination of the Holy Spirit he was so convinced of the
          abominations of Popery, that following the counsel of God, he
          separated himself from it. He afterward rejected, among other Popish
          errors, infant baptism, and taught with all possible zeal, the
          immersion of believers according to the command of Christ. In company
          with one hundred and ten others, he was baptized by William Roubli,
          one of the earliest Swiss Baptists, and for some time a pastor at
          Basle. He himself baptized some three hundred persons in the few
          following months. He published a work on baptism, which brought, in
          the autumn, a virulent reply from Zwingle, the great Protestant Swiss
          Reformer. Some of the Baptists were cast into prison, and so cruel
          were the proceedings, that even the populace complained that injustice
          was done to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hubmeyer published a tract, in which he complains of Zwingle and his
          followers: That they had proceeded at one time so far as to throw into
          a dark and miserable tower, twenty persons, both men and pregnant
          women, widows and young females, and to pronounce this sentence upon
          them—that thenceforward they should see neither sun nor moon for the
          remainder of their lives, and be fed until their days were ended with
          bread and water, and that they should remain in the dark tower
          together, both the living and the dead, surrounded with filth and
          putrefaction, until not a single survivor of the whole remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Oh, God!&quot; writes this good man, &quot;what a hard, severe,
          cruel sentence upon pious Christian people, of whom no one could speak
          evil, only that they had received water baptism in obedience to the
          command of Christ.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hubmeyer courageously went to the stake, and was burned to death on
          the 10th of March, 1528. His wife was also the partner of his
          sufferings. She was condemned to death by drowning, and in the river
          Danube found a watery grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter whether Romanists or Protestants gained the ascendancy—the
          Baptists were persecuted by both alike. The reason of this was, that
          they claimed for the church of Christ, and the consciences of men,
          freedom from all human control. This was their distinguishing trait;
          and it was the assertion of this principle that brought them into
          collision with every form and ceremony of human invention in the
          worship of God, and every effort to bind the conscience to observe
          them. To worship God aright, the spirit must be free; for true worship
          is voluntary, and can only come from a willing heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what I have submitted, it will be seen that the Baptists stood
          alone, as the defenders of religious liberty, during the progress of
          the Reformation, and for many years after. It will also be seen, that
          their idea of the church, composed of none but believers, immersed on
          the profession of their faith, was the grand cause of the separation
          of the Baptists, as individuals and communities, from all the
          ecclesiastical organizations supported by the Reformers and their
          successors. From the very nature of the case, there could be no union
          between them; from the first they were opposites, and so they
          remained. The Baptists occupied an independent and original position;
          they were neither Romanists nor Protestants, but thorough religious
          reformers, elevating their standard of religious liberty far above the
          most exalted ideas of Protestant toleration.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus it continued to be, until the establishment of the American
          Republic. Other denominations contended for toleration; Baptists
          demanded for themselves, and all others, religious liberty—the right
          of every one to worship God as he might choose. Even the Puritans, who
          fled from persecution in England, had no idea of religious liberty.
          They came here to establish their own faith, and to exclude all
          others! Hence they were more rigidly intolerant than the countries
          whence they had fled from persecution! &quot;Intolerance was a
          necessary condition of their enterprise. They feared and hated
          religious liberty.&quot; (Dr. Ellis, Lecture before the New England
          Historical Society, March 11, 1860.)
        </p>
        <p>
          All who did not conform to their views, were fined and imprisoned, and
          whipped and banished. And, as Baptists were especially opposed to
          religious oppression, the heaviest persecutions fell upon them. Hence,
          in 1644, a law was passed in Massachusetts against the Baptists, by
          which it was &quot;ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons
          within this jurisdiction shall either openly condemn or oppose the
          baptism of infants, or seduce others to do so, or leave the
          congregation during the administration of the rite—he shall be
          sentenced to banishment.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same year we accordingly find that a poor man was tied up and
          whipped for refusing to have his child sprinkled. On July 30, 1651,
          Obadiah Holmes, John Clark, and John Crandall, Baptist ministers, were
          arrested near Lynn, Massachusetts, while preaching on the Lord&#x27;s
          day, taken to the parish church in the afternoon, sent to the Boston
          jail, and subsequently fined. The fines of Clark and Crandall were,
          after a while, paid, but Mr. Holmes was kept in Boston jail until
          September, when he was tied to the whipping-post and publicly whipped.
          His clothes were stripped off, and thirty lashes sunk into his naked
          flesh, which was so torn and cut that for weeks afterward he could
          only rest upon his hands and knees even in bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This same spirit of persecution was manifested against Roger Williams.
          In 1639, he became a Baptist, and in 1643 went to England from New
          York, because he had been banished from Boston. In March, 1644, he
          obtained the charter for the colony of Rhode Island, with power for
          the colony to make its own laws; and in September, 1644, under that
          charter was established the first government on earth that granted
          full religious liberty. It was the first spot the sun had ever shone
          upon where the rights of conscience were fully acknowledged, and it
          was founded by a Baptist. It is considered the germ of that religious
          liberty which all American citizens now enjoy, for up to the very
          dawning of the American Revolution, and even after that period,
          Baptists continued to struggle and suffer heroically for religious
          liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Virginia, where the first permanent colony in America was
          established, the charter bearing date 1606, fourteen years before the
          Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Baptists were bitterly persecuted. By
          law, a fine of two thousand pounds of tobacco was imposed on
          &quot;those who neglected to have their infants baptized.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptist ministers were arrested and imprisoned as vagrants; some were
          pulled down from the stand as they were preaching, insulted and
          whipped, and many were imprisoned for preaching the Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elders John Waller, Lewis Craig, and James Childs were seized at a
          meeting, June 4, 1768, dragged before the magistrate, and imprisoned
          for forty-three days in Fredericksburg. Mr. Wofford was severely
          scourged, and carried the scars to his grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Hawks, historian of the Episcopal Church of Virginia, says:
          &quot;No dissenters in Virginia experienced harsher treatment than did
          the Baptists. They were beaten and imprisoned, and cruelty taxed its
          ingenuity to devise new modes of punishment and annoyance.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Baptists struggled on. On September 5, 1774, a Congress
          elected by the people of twelve colonies met at Philadelphia to
          consult for the general interests. The Warren Baptist Association of
          Rhode Island sent an agent—Rev. Isaac Backus, who with his mother,
          brother, and uncle, had suffered imprisonment for being Baptists—to
          Philadelphia, to join with the Philadelphia Baptist Association in
          presenting a memorial to Congress to secure religious liberty. But
          they met opposition; some even accusing the Baptists of trying to
          break up the Union, when they merely advocated universal religious
          liberty!
        </p>

          The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental
          Congress in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776. But the Declaration of
          Independence did not remove oppressive laws from colonial or State
          statute-books. In Virginia, for four years after the Declaration of
          Independence, marriages performed by Baptists were unlawful, their
          children declared illegitimate, and their inheritances were
          confiscated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not until 1785, was religious liberty fully established by law in
          Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, whose father was a Baptist, being the
          author of the bill. In 1809, writing to the members of the Baptist
          Church at Buck Mountain, whom he acknowledged as his coadjutors in the
          work, he says: &quot;We have acted together from the origin to the end
          of a memorable revolution, and we have contributed, each in the line
          allotted us, our endeavors to render its issues a permanent blessing
          to our country.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A National Constitution for the United States was adopted in 1787. Its
          provisions were satisfactory as far as they went, but religious
          liberty was not sufficiently guarded. The Baptist General Committee of
          Virginia, in 1788, expressed their disapproval of this important
          omission, and, after consultation with James Madison, this committee,
          in August, 1789, wrote to General Washington, then President of the
          United States, saying that they feared that liberty of conscience,
          dearer to them than property or life, was not sufficiently guarded.
          Washington gave them a kind and encouraging reply, in which occurs the
          following language: &quot;While I recollect with satisfaction that the
          religious society of which you are members have been, throughout
          America, uniformly, and almost unanimously, the firm friends of civil
          liberty, and the persevering promoters of our glorious Revolution, I
          cannot hesitate to believe that they will be the faithful supporters
          of a free yet efficient general government.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next month that immortal First Amendment to the Constitution
          was adopted by Congress: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting
          an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
          thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the
          right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government
          for a redress of grievances.&quot; Thus were Baptists the propagators
          of our religious liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptists have not changed since the Reformation, or the days of
          Washington. Their principles are still the same; and these principles
          bind them to the propagation of religious liberty. The very
          constitution of a Baptist church is compatible only with enjoyment of
          such liberty. It is composed of those who have exercised an
          intelligent choice, and who, in the possession of liberty to go
          elsewhere unmolested, have preferred to unite with it. Like true
          philanthropists they desire that all other&#x27;s may enjoy equal
          freedom with themselves. They would use their liberty in endeavoring
          to liberate others. Infant baptism they regard as one great source of
          the destruction of religious liberty; in laboring therefore to lead
          its adherents to abandon it, they are seeking to effect a reform which
          will leave the conscience free to act according to its own convictions
          of God&#x27;s requirements, which Paedobaptism prevents it from doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is sometimes said that these persecutions of Baptists by
          Protestants, must be attributed to the age in which they lived. How
          then are we to account for Baptists being so much in advance of the
          age? In contrast with the spirit of Zwingle, mark the sentiments
          expressed by Jeronimus Segerson, who with his wife suffered martyrdom
          in September, 1551, one by burning, and the other by drowning, for the
          sin of being Baptists. They were both in prison at the time, separated
          from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We must likewise wrestle with enemies; that is, we must wrestle
          here in this world with emperors, with the powers and princes of this
          world. We must in this world suffer, for Paul has said, &#x27;that all
          who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.&#x27; We
          must completely conquer the world, sin, death, and the devil, not with
          material swords and spears, but with the sword of the Spirit, which is
          the Word of God, and with the shield of faith, with which we must
          quench all sharp and fiery darts, and place on our heads the helmet of
          salvation, with the armor of righteousness, and our feet be shod with
          the preparation of the Gospel. Being thus strengthened with these
          weapons, we shall oppose and overcome all our enemies.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same spirit has ever been manifested by Baptists. While others
          clamored for liberty and toleration when they were oppressed, and
          then, as soon as they came into power, began to oppress
          others—Baptists have claimed religious liberty for all, and have
          heroically suffered that all men might be free. Not in the age, but in
          the error of infant baptism, lies the root of state churches and
          religious persecutions; and only as Baptist influence keeps these in
          check, will Paedobaptism be prevented from bringing forth its
          legitimate fruit in the destruction of religious liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever Paedobaptism has had the opportunity to develop itself, it
          has always produced oppression and persecution, both in Romish and
          Protestant communities. Its direct tendency is to crush religious
          liberty, and destroy the rights of conscience. This is capable of
          proof, not merely from history, but from the very nature of the thing
          itself. Let me demonstrate this.
        </p>
        <p>
          By infant baptism a person is committed, while unconscious, to a
          certain church—he is made a member of that church. Now, unless that
          church is infallible, it has no right to make a person a member
          without his consent; for, it may commit him to an alliance with error,
          and to the defense of it. But all churches are fallible, they may err;
          a person who is made a member of such a church in infancy, may
          discover an error in that church when he arrives at maturity. Without
          his own consent, he has been committed to that error; he was not left
          free to choose, where it is evident, from the nature of things, a
          choice might have been exercised. Paedobaptism is therefore
          inconsistent with liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will more fully appear from the following: All Paedobaptists
          agree that there is more than one mode of baptism. They all teach,
          also, that baptism is to be administered but once to the same
          individual. It is evident, then, from their own admission, that a
          choice may be exercised as to the mode; but they administer baptism to
          a child, while in a state of unconsciousness, and, according to their
          own teaching that person is never to be baptized again, however much
          he may prefer another mode—which they all admit to be equally
          valid—when he is converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multitudes find themselves thus embarrassed on arriving at maturity,
          and on experiencing conversion. They feel that their liberty has been
          taken away; and that, according to the teaching of their church, they
          cannot exercise a choice, where that very church admits that a choice
          might be made, if they were free. In order to enjoy liberty, they must
          of necessity go to the Baptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any should strenuously contend for only one mode of baptism, it
          should be Paedobaptists; for, they administer baptism when the subject
          knows nothing about it, and then maintain that it must not be
          repeated. They ought to be able, when the baptized child comes to
          years of understanding, to prove from the Word of God, beyond the
          possibility of a doubt, that the mode adopted by them was the only
          correct one.
        </p>
        <p>
          These remarks apply with equal force to the subjects of baptism.
          Suppose a Paedobaptist child is conscientiously convinced that he
          should be baptized after repentance and faith? He must either leave
          the church of which he is a member, or continue with it while he
          violates its teachings, or give up his religious liberty, and neglect
          his known duty. Numerous instances might be given to prove this. I
          will relate one, which illustrates this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs. C., of Wethersfield, Connecticut, was sprinkled in infancy
          (neither of her parents being at the time professors of religion), by
          Rev. Dr. Chapin, pastor of a Paedobaptist church in that place. On
          arriving at maturity she experienced conversion, and desired to be
          re-sprinkled, but was refused. She then asked for her letter, which
          was also refused. After a long effort to persuade her to relinquish
          her purpose, she at length obtained her letter, and united with a
          Baptist church five miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, Paedobaptism tends to crush religious liberty, because it
          leads parents to do violence to the consciences of their children.
          Baptized children, when they are converted, frequently become Baptists
          in sentiment; but they are often forced to unite with Paedobaptist
          churches against their choice, or remain without a public profession
          of faith, or join the church of their choice at great sacrifice, and
          with much opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Roman Catholics are far more consistent in this matter than
          Protestants who pursue such a course. They are taught that to leave
          the Romish church involves the certain loss of their soul; they are
          therefore bound, in order, as they suppose, to save their children
          from perdition, to keep them from becoming Protestants. But
          Protestants, generally, admit Baptists to be correct in all that is
          essential to salvation; if they oppose the union of their children
          with the Baptists, they exhibit more bigotry than the Romanist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, religious liberty involves the right to think, examine,
          decide, and choose for ourselves in all matters between the conscience
          and its Maker. This, Baptists seek to propagate; and to this,
          Paedobaptism, both in the Romish and Protestant bodies, is opposed. In
          contending, then, for the baptism of believers only, we contend for
          man&#x27;s dearest rights—the rights of conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let Baptist principles prevail, and there will be no forcing the
          conscience, no forestalling the judgment; but man, free to act
          intelligently and understandingly, according to the light he
          possesses, will render to God voluntary obedience, none desiring to
          &quot;molest him or make him afraid.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It was thus with the author of these Lectures. He was sprinkled in
          infancy, and made a member of the Presbyterian Church. On arriving at
          &quot;years of discretion,&quot; and on experiencing conversion, his
          mind was led to the investigation of the subjects and mode of baptism.
          He came to the conclusion that believers were the only subjects, and
          immersion the only mode. But he found that, on account of his infant
          baptism, he could not be immersed, as a believer, in the Presbyterian
          Church. For, their Confession of Faith teaches that baptism is not to
          be repeated to the same subject, and he could not ask any minister of
          that church as to deliberately violate his ordination vows, which bind
          him to sustain that Confession of Faith; neither would he have
          accepted immersion at the hands of such a one, had it been offered.
          But he saw at once that his liberty had been taken away. He looked at
          the children of Baptists, who, while they had been instructed just as
          religiously as himself, were not trammeled by an act done for them
          when they could make no choice. He saw that they were free to act as
          their consciences, enlightened by the Word of God, might dictate. He
          therefore acted consistently, and united with that sect which is
          &quot;everywhere spoken against.&quot; And the opposition of
          relatives, all of whom were Paedobaptists, only quickened his steps
          toward the platform of religious liberty—a Baptist church.

        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;One is your Master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot;
          Matthew 23:8
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most inveterate sins of fallen humanity, is pride. Man
          thirsts for power. He loves to be elevated above his fellows, and to
          occupy a position of acknowledged superiority. He delights to be
          clothed with a little brief authority, which will enable him to look
          on all around him as his inferiors. It is the working of this spirit
          of arrogance which has created so many grades among men, both in the
          world and in the church. Christ&#x27;s apostles were infected with
          this spirit. They had imbibed it from the Jewish Scribes and
          Pharisees. They thirsted for the possession of such a degree of power
          and authority, as would entitle them to dictate to and rule over their
          brethren. Hence, we find them frequently disputing as to who should be
          the greatest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ invariably rebuked this spirit on every occasion of its
          manifestation. He taught them humility. He showed them that the
          principles of his gospel were opposed to all such sentiments of pride,
          and that instead of favoring the arrogant wishes of depraved
          humanity--it was designed to convert believers into a universal
          brotherhood, all possessing equal rights, acknowledging but one Head,
          one Superior, one Master, even Christ himself. He taught that his
          church was to be an association of brethren, all its members subject
          to one law, and all amenable to one tribunal, the voice of Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          But how sadly has the teaching of Christ on this subject been
          perverted; and the professedly Christian church, instead of presenting
          to us the beautiful picture of a circle of brethren, meeting together
          on the broad platform of equality, exhibits an array of gradations in
          authority, which vies with the most despotic governments of the world.
          Priestly arrogance and ministerial assumption of authority are
          exhibited on almost every hand, in both the Protestant and Papal
          churches; and from the class-leader to the mitered bishop--from the
          ruling elder to the triple-crowned Pope--there is a violation of
          Christ&#x27;s declaration: &quot;One is your master, even Christ, and
          all you are brethren.&quot; Reform here is needed; and I announce,
          therefore, as the Fourth Feature of the reform at which Baptists aim,
        </p>
        <p>The establishment of the equality of Christ&#x27;s disciples.</p>
        <p>
          I. It will devolve on me to show, in the first place, that such
          equality does not generally exist. In Romish and Protestant churches
          there is no recognition of equality among professed disciples of
          Christ. I suppose I need not stop to prove this assertion in reference
          to Romanism. All acknowledge that there are grades of power, both
          temporal and ecclesiastical, in that church. Even her most devoted
          adherents will not deny it. On the contrary, they admit and defend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us, then, turn to the Protestant churches. And first we will
          notice the EPISCOPAL Church. Does this church recognize equality among
          her members? We reply, No! She has distinct and separate grades; and
          not only is the ministry above the laity, but there are three grades
          in the ministry: deacons, priests and bishops.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the ANGLICAN church in England, the bishops of this church, by
          virtue of their office, are clothed with temporal power. They are
          peers of the realm—that is, nobles of the land. The archbishop of
          Canterbury has the appointment of all the bishops, and is the highest
          nobleman of England. The archbishops hold authority over all the
          bishops. The bishops hold authority over all the churches, and
          inferior clergy, in their respective dioceses. They appoint ministers
          to their charges; they suspend, degrade, and excommunicate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In America there are no archbishops. But the bishops, though
          possessing no civil power, have the same ecclesiastical power as those
          in England. The church has no voice in her government. In the
          Triennial Convention, the bishops form a separate house distinct and
          superior to the clergy and laity. The appropriate language of the
          bishops in England would be: &quot;One is our Master, the archbishop,
          and all we are lords;&quot; while both in England and America there is
          no recognition of the equality taught by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us look again at the PRESBYTERIAN church. Does equality reign
          here? Do all her members stand on the broad even platform of the
          Gospel? Can they say, &quot;One is our Master, even Christ?&quot; Let
          them answer for themselves. Both in their Confession of Faith and Form
          of Government, we find that the government rests not in the hands of
          the church, but in the session, presbytery, synod and General
          Assembly. These bodies attend to all the business of the church. An
          individual church has no power to act in the reception of members, the
          exclusion of members, the calling or dismissing of a pastor, or any
          other act of government which Christ has committed to his church.
          Other masters are recognized besides him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole tendency of Presbyterian church government is to exalt the
          ministry in their authority above the church. Indeed, the ministry
          belong to a different order. They do not belong to the church as the
          other members do; they belong to the Presbytery. The church can not
          discipline a minister; neither can the session try him; but the
          presbytery must do it. Lest these assertions should startle any who
          have never examined the subject, permit me to give a few quotations
          from printed documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Westminster Confession says: &quot;The Lord Jesus, as king and
          head of his church, has therein appointed a government in the hand of
          church-officers. To these officers, the keys of the kingdom of Heaven
          are committed, by virtue whereof they have power, respectively, to
          retain and remit sins, to shut that kingdom against the impenitent,
          both by the word and censures, and to open it onto penitent sinners as
          occasion shall require.&quot; These officers we are told, by the Form
          of Government, are &quot;Bishops or pastors, ruling elders and
          deacons.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The same Form of Government gives us the character of all the
          different bodies composed by these officers, for the government of the
          church. &quot;The church session consists of the pastor or pastors,
          and ruling elders of a particular congregation;&quot; and &quot;it is
          expedient, at every meeting of the session, that there be a presiding
          minister. When, therefore, a church is without a pastor, the moderator
          of the session shall be either the minister appointed by the
          presbytery for that purpose, or one invited by the session.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we are told that among other things &quot;it is the duty of the
          session to receive members into the church, or exclude from the church
          those who deserve it, and to appoint delegates to the higher
          judicatories of the church.&quot; The church cannot act in receiving
          her own members. The session attends to this for her. A majority of
          the members of the church might be opposed to the reception of an
          individual, but if the session receives him, he is admitted. On the
          other hand, a person may fall under the censure of the session, and,
          though all the church beside may esteem him a Christian—the session
          has power to exclude and excommunicate him. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is more fully exhibited in the Directory for Worship. We are told
          that when baptized children &quot;come to years of discretion, if they
          are free from scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient
          knowledge to discern the Lord&#x27;s body, they ought to be informed
          it is their duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The
          years of discretion in young Christians cannot be precisely fixed.
          This must be left to the prudence of the eldership. The officers of
          the church are the judges of the qualifications of those to be
          admitted to sealing ordinances; and of the time when it is proper to
          admit young Christians to them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here implied that the church, that is, the inferior members of
          it, as distinct from the session, is not possessed of sufficient
          prudence to judge of the qualifications of those who are to be
          admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, the Presbytery has power over the session and the church.
          By this body the rights of the church to call and dismiss a pastor are
          taken away from the people. When a Presbyterian church calls a pastor,
          the call is not made to him, but to the Presbytery. &quot;The call
          shall be presented to the Presbytery under whose care the person
          called shall be; that, if the Presbytery think it expedient to present
          the call to him, it may be accordingly presented; and no minister or
          candidate shall receive a call, but through the hands of a
          Presbytery.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, also, the minister himself is subject, not to the church, but to
          the Presbytery. He can not move without the permission of this body.
          &quot;No pastor shall be translated from one church to another, nor
          shall he receive any call for that purpose, but by the permission of
          the Presbytery.&quot; &quot;The Presbytery, on the whole view of the
          case, shall either continue him in his former charge, or translate
          him, as they shall deem most for the peace and edification of the
          church.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here implied that the Presbytery is more competent to judge of
          the affairs of a church, and to decide what is for its good, than the
          church itself! The church may think it best for their pastor to remove
          from them; but the Presbytery may think it best for him to stay; the
          only alternative the church has, is to starve him out, and this they
          cannot do, so long as they have real estate enough to pay his salary.
          This system is degrading to freemen, and insulting to Christianity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to the Presbytery is the Synod, and then the General Assembly.
          The Session must submit its doings to the Presbytery, the Presbytery
          to the Synod, and the Synod to the General Assembly. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          The DUTCH REFORMED church is governed in a manner similar to the
          Presbyterian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us turn our attention for a moment to the METHODIST EPISCOPAL
          church. Shall we find equality here? No; for its very name shows that
          its government is prelatical. I need not enlarge on this point; for no
          one, surely, will pretend that there is equality in this church. Its
          founder expressly disavows any idea of it. He says, in a letter to
          John Mason, dated Jan. 13, 1790, &quot;As long as I live the people
          shall have no share in choosing either stewards or leaders among the
          Methodists. We are no republicans, and never intend to be. It would be
          better for those who are so minded to go quietly away.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more grades in the Methodist Episcopal church than in any
          other Protestant community; and any one who will read the
          &quot;Discipline,&quot; will be convinced of it. A private member in
          the church has no voice whatever in the government. Private members
          are amenable to the class-leader; the class-leader to the preacher;
          the preacher to the presiding elder; the presiding elder to the
          bishop. Is this equality? The people have no voice in electing or
          dismissing their preacher, but must take whoever is sent, and let him
          go at the expiration of three years. The preacher has no choice of his
          field of labor. He must go just where the bishop may please to send
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church does not receive or expel either her ministers or members.
          The circuit preacher has power to expel private members; the quarterly
          conference to expel local preachers, deacons and elders; the yearly
          conference to expel traveling preachers; the general conference to
          expel bishops. Is this equality?
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the following question and answer in the Methodist Discipline, in
          reference to the ordination of an elder, and then read the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Will you reverently obey your chief ministers, unto whom is
          committed the charge and government over you; following with a glad
          mind and will their godly admonitions, and submitting yourself to
          their godly judgments?
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I will do so, the Lord being my helper.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          Chief ministers! chief ministers! who are they? &quot;One is your
          master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; Surely, the
          language of Christ, and the language of the Discipline are very
          dissimilar. These churches, whose forms of government I have reviewed,
          compose the great majority of the professedly Christian world. It is
          evident, then, that such equality as the text teaches does not
          generally exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I proceed to show, in the second place, that Baptists seek to
          establish such equality. The principles of church government in the
          Baptist denomination are expressed in the text: &quot;One is your
          master, even Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; There is no
          opportunity for the assumption of authority by a few, if it were
          desired. All meet on the broad, even platform of equality. The rich
          and the poor, the minister, deacons, and people, are all brethren. The
          pastor is no more, the poorest member is no less, than one of the
          brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each church, in its collective capacity, transacts its own business,
          exercises its own discipline, and receives and excludes its own
          members, subject only to the authority of Christ, and governed only by
          his Word. On all questions, every member of the church has an equal
          right to speak and to vote. There is no authority superior to the
          church, to reverse its decisions, or to call it to account. The
          pastor, while he has no superior authority, has equal rights with the
          rest of his brethren. If called to another field of labor, he is at
          liberty to go without asking permsission from a bishop, presbytery, or
          council. He is perfectly free to act in accordance with his own views
          of duty and his own convictions of right.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a Baptist church there is perfect equality. It could not be
          otherwise. They recognize the church as a voluntary organization, into
          which persons enter by their own choice, and whose privileges and
          benefits all have an equal right to share. Christ has nowhere
          delegated his authority to a body of arrogant ministers, or prelatical
          bishops, or blasphemous popes; and Christians have no right to
          recognize and uphold the assumption of authority by them. It is not a
          matter of indifference. To support the assumptions of men, who have
          arrogated to themselves authority which belongs only to Christ, is to
          engage with them in rebellion against the one only Master; and where
          this is done knowingly, such cannot be held guiltless.
        </p>
        <p>
          In laboring, then, to advance Baptist sentiments, we aim to exalt
          Christ as the supreme and only Lawgiver and Ruler in Zion, in the
          place of presbyters, and bishops, and councils, and popes, who have
          usurped his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, some suppose that every church has a right to make its own laws,
          and to alter these laws to suit times, and circumstances, and places.
          Now, if the church was a merely human organization, this might be
          correct reasoning. But all churches claim to be of divine origin, and
          to have divine authority for their constitution and government. It is
          evident, therefore. that all cannot be right, for God cannot sanction
          contradictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, if every church has a right to establish its own form of
          government, then the Romish church has an equal right with any
          Protestant church to invent and establish one, and no Protestant who
          takes this ground can consistently say a word against the Papal
          hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if all are right, then right and wrong are no longer opposites.
          But all are not right. Christ has taught, in his Word, that the
          highest authority on earth is the church. Hence, in giving his
          apostles directions how to proceed in cases of offence, he designates
          the church as the supreme and final umpire. &quot;Tell it to the
          church; and if he neglects to hear the church, let him be to you as a
          heathen man and a publican.&quot; Tell it to the church—not to the
          session, or presbytery, or synod, or general assembly, or council, or
          conference, or bishop, or cardinal, or pope—but to the church. And if
          he neglects to hear the church—what then? appeal? No; there is no
          higher authority to appeal to; for &quot;One is your master, even
          Christ, and all you are brethren.&quot; The creation of other
          tribunals is the result of the arrogance of men who love to &quot;lord
          it over God&#x27;s heritage;&quot; and the support of them is owing
          mainly to the influence of just such men, and their willing dupes.
          Baptists are willing to be &quot;all brethren;&quot; the ministry has
          no desire to be exalted to a position of rivalry to the Master in his
          church.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order more forcibly to exhibit the contrast between Baptists and
          the other most prominent seats, let us suppose Christ to come again
          upon earth, and visit the places of worship in New York city and
          preach from this text. See him enter St. Patrick&#x27;s cathedral. The
          Cardinal receives him very graciously, elated with the idea that the
          claim of Rome to be THE church is thus sanctioned by the Savior, and
          he invites him to preach. He announces this text, and preaches as he
          did upon the plains of Judea: &quot;You know that those who are
          accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them, and
          their great ones exercise authority over them; but so shall it not be
          among you. But whoever will be great among you shall be your servant;
          and whoever of you will be the chief, shall be the servant of all. Be
          not called rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ, and all you are
          brethren.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cardinal grows uneasy; he reminds the Preacher of the Pope, the
          Cardinals, the Archbishops, the Bishops, the Father Confessors, the
          Priests; but the Divine Teacher asserts that these are distinctions
          which men have made, and reiterates the doctrine of the text—universal
          equality among his disciples. The Cardinal denounces the Savior as a
          heretic, and he is thrust out.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then wends his way through our great thoroughfare to Trinity
          Church. Here he is cordially received, for the Episcopal also claims
          to be THE Church, and here he repeats the sermon. But he is reminded
          of the Archbishops, the Bishops, the Triennial Convention, the
          Priests, the Deacons. He pronounces these classes all contrary to his
          teaching. The Bishop intimates that he is probably a fanatical
          dissenter, and he is politely handed to the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          He visits in succession a Presbyterian and a Methodist congregation
          with the same sermon. In the former he is reminded of the Session,
          Presbytery, Synod, General Assembly. In the latter, he is cautioned
          about the &quot;chief ministers;&quot; and the Class-leader, Steward,
          Preacher, Presiding Elder, Bishop, with their respective powers, are
          set before him. And for simply reiterating his own teachings, he is
          treated as a disturber of the peace, and put out of both places.
        </p>
        <p>
          See him now seek a Baptist pulpit. His sermon is just in accordance
          with their practice. There is nothing among them with which it comes
          in contact; no classes—none to exercise lordship or authority over
          them: &quot;for one is their Master, even Christ, and all they are
          brethren.&quot; A sincere &quot;Amen,&quot; is the response from every
          heart, and the world&#x27;s Redeemer, banished from the Romish and
          Protestant assemblies, finds a refuge and a home in every Baptist
          church!

        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;And the Lord answered me and said: Write the vision and make it
          plain upon tables, that he may run who reads it.&quot; Habakkuk 2:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          God&#x27;s solicitude for man&#x27;s well-being and eternal salvation
          is truly wonderful. Having made a revelation of his will, he is
          anxious that no ambiguity or indefiniteness should obscure his
          commands from his erring creatures. He wishes to afford to ruined man,
          all the advantages possible, in order that he may be saved from the
          fearful consequences of his sin and guilt. Hence, he has not involved
          his duty in mist and uncertainty, but, on the contrary, he has
          revealed plainly all his moral requirements and positive institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, he has expressly commanded those to whom is
          committed the great work of transcribing his will for others, to do it
          so plainly, that every duty may be recognized with such ease,
          &quot;that he may run that reads it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          But alas! alas! the express command of Jehovah has been violated, and
          his benevolent designs toward our race in a measure frustrated, by the
          efforts of those with whom the advancement of sect, and the
          propagation of human dogmas, is of more importance than the glory of
          God and the salvation of souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Translators have not scrupled to bow to the mandate of kings, the
          dictation of councils, the restrictions of Bible Society boards, and
          the promptings of sectarian prejudices, until the bare enunciation of
          the principle contained in the text, has come to be denounced as
          sectarianism; and faithful obedience to the plain requirements of
          Jehovah in this respect, is assailed as a close and narrow bigotry.
          This state of things calls loudly for reform. I present, then, as the
          Fifth Feature of the reform at which Baptists aim, The establishment
          of the correct principle of biblical translation.
        </p>
        <p>In presenting this theme, let us inquire,</p>
        <p>
          I. What is the Correct Principle on which Translations of the Holy
          Scriptures should be made? To this I reply, that they should be
          conformed, as nearly as possible, to the inspired originals. Let it be
          remembered, that the Bible which we possess is a translation. The
          words of our English version are invested with Divine authority, only
          so far as they express just what the original expresses. I present
          this thought because there is, in the minds of many, a superstitious
          reverence for the words and phrases of our English version. This being
          a translation, partakes more or less of the imperfections of the
          translators; and, in every instance where the original is not clearly
          and fully translated, it is the word of man, and not the Word of God.
          The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew, and the New
          Testament in Greek. In translating, therefore, into English, or
          Burmese, or French, or Berman, or Bengali, or any other language—it is
          evident to anyone, that the Hebrew and the Greek should be the
          standard to which these translations should be conformed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is further evident, that every word that is capable of being
          translated, should be rendered into any other language so as to
          express just what the original did to those to whom it was given.
          There must be no transliteration of a Hebrew or Greek word into
          English or Burmese, for such a word would be unintelligible to the
          mere English or Burmese reader; and he must wait until someone, who
          understands these languages, shall come and explain to him the meaning
          of such words. Let me illustrate:
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose an aged father, a Frenchman, writes a letter of instructions
          to his children and grandchildren, just as the former are about to
          emigrate to the United States. The letter is written in the French
          language, and is readily understood by the children. But the
          grandchildren grow up in ignorance of the French language, though they
          understand the English very well. Their parents die and leave the
          letter in their possession. In order to understand it, they must have
          it translated. Now suppose the person employed to translate, leaves
          here and there a word in French—untranslated. Those words would be
          unintelligible to them. They would be transliterated, not translated.
          In order to be a good translation, the letter must express in English,
          just what the original expressed in French.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so with the Scriptures; the correct principle of translating them
          is to make them speak to all the nations just what they spoke to those
          who had them from the hand of God—just what the originals express.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this principle is correct, is evident, also, from the fact that
          all Protestants, in discussions, appeal not to the translations that
          have been made, but to the original. They regard the original only as
          the standard. In the Westminster Assembly&#x27;s Confession of Faith
          we find the following: &quot;The Old Testament in Hebrew, (which was
          the native language of the people of God of old,) and the New
          Testament in Greek, (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most
          generally known to the nations,) being immediately inspired by God,
          and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are
          therefore authentic; so as, in all controversies of religion, the
          church is finally to appeal unto them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is the practice of all Protestants. It is evident, then, that
          all translations should be made to conform to the original, which is
          the standard of appeal. But I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This Principle has been Generally Abandoned. There is no Bible
          Society, supported by Paedobaptists, that is pledged to the faithful
          translation of the Word of God from the inspired originals. In England
          and America the English version, which is acknowledged to have many
          defects, is made the standard, instead of the original. Nor is this
          all. Even this is not translated fully into the heathen tongues—some
          words are transliterated, not translated. They are perfectly
          incomprehensible to those who read them until someone comes and
          explains them, and he may explain them just to suit his own views.
        </p>
        <p>
          The British and Foreign Bible Society of England, composed of all
          evangelical denominations, passed a resolution, on the 1st July, 1883,
          virtually declining aid to translators of the Bible in foreign
          languages, unless &quot;the Greek terms relating to baptism be
          rendered, either according to the principles adopted by the
          translators of the authorized English version, by a word derived from
          the original, or by such terms as may be considered unobjectionable by
          the other denominations of Christians composing the Bible
          Society.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been the practice of the missionaries to translate these words,
          as well as all others. Now you perceive the resolution does not charge
          them with unfaithful translation, neither does it charge them to
          faithfully render the words into the language of the heathen; but it
          requires them to adopt the principle of the English translators, which
          was to transliterate and not translate certain words, which, if
          translated, would not yield that support to infant baptism which the
          transliteration of them does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The American Bible Society, composed of all evangelical denominations,
          in February, 1836, passed the following preamble and resolution:
          &quot;As the managers are now called to aid extensively in circulating
          the sacred Scriptures in languages other than the English, they deem
          it their duty in conforming with the obvious spirit of their compact,
          to adopt the following resolution as the rule of their conduct in
          making appropriations for the circulation of the Scriptures in all
          foreign tongues:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That in appropriating money for the translating,
          printing or distributing the Sacred Scriptures in foreign languages,
          the managers feel at liberty to encourage only such versions as
          conform, in the principles of their translations, to the common
          English version; at least so far, as that all the religious
          denominations represented in this Society can consistently use and
          circulate said versions to their several schools and
          communities.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, again, you perceive there is an abandonment of the correct
          principle. That principle requires a faithful translation from the
          original. But the resolution just quoted requires that the English
          version, which, as I have before stated, is acknowledged to contain
          errors of translation, be made the standard. And even this is to be
          conformed to, only so far as that &quot;all the denominations
          represented in the Society&quot; can consistently use the versions
          made from it. These two societies represent pretty nearly the entire
          Protestant world in England and America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now anyone will perceive, that while such resolutions were in force,
          no missionary, who was governed by them, could attempt to faithfully
          translate from the original into the languages of the heathen.
          Consequently if a word occurred in the Greek which, if translated,
          would not suit all denominations, it must be transliterated—and then
          the heathen could not understand it until it was explained by a
          missionary, and he might explain it just to suit his own creed.
          Instead, then, of having God&#x27;s Word, which they would have, if
          the original was translated, they have in every instance, only the
          word of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me, before I leave this division of my subject, exhibit the evils
          of this course. No principle that is correct can be violated without
          evil results. We have seen that the correct principle of Biblical
          translation is violated by all Paedobaptist organizations; we may
          therefore look for evil as its legitimate fruit. The principle on
          which they act is, that it is right to make such versions, and such
          only, as shall teach Paedobaptist sentiments. Because Baptists refused
          to transliterate Greek words into the heathen tongues, and insisted on
          translating them, they were thrust out. But, in order to make the
          Bible teach Paedobaptism, the translations must be mutilated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now look at the fruits of this in heathen lands. The first
          missionaries, and the first Bible translators, were Baptists. Hence,
          the first versions made in heathen tongues were faithful translations.
          After these translations had been circulated, the Paedobaptist
          missionaries began to circulate their versions, in which words
          relating to baptism, and other words, were transliterated. The heathen
          convert, when he read the translated word, could understand it, and
          knew what to do. But when he read the transliterated word, he could
          not understand it; he must wait until he could find a teacher to tell
          him what it meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he met a Baptist missionary, he would tell him that the word meant
          to immerse. Then be would ask, &quot;Why does it not read so?&quot;
          What could the missionary say? He would have to say, &quot;The
          translator who produced that version was bound by his Bible Society to
          put that word in.&quot; And if pressed for a reason for this, he must
          tell him of all the differences and disputes among Christians at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          But suppose he meets a Paedobaptist. He tells him it means to pour, or
          it means to sprinkle. But the convert would ask him, &quot;Why not put
          it so? We have words in our language which mean to pour or
          sprinkle.&quot; What would he say? He must give a reason; and he could
          assign no reason which would not awaken the suspicion of the converted
          pagan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take another case. A Baptist mission has been established; all has
          been harmonious. A transliterated version falls into the hands of the
          people, and at once all is confusion and distrust, and the cause of
          Christ is arrested. I present these cases, because it has generally
          been represented by Paedobaptists, that the Baptists have introduced
          controversy among the heathen nations on this subject; whereas, just
          the reverse of this is the case. It could not be otherwise; for the
          Baptists were the first to occupy heathen ground, and they had
          translated the Scriptures into many languages before a Paedobaptist
          transliteration version was made. On these Paedobaptists rests the
          guilt, not only of mutilating God&#x27;s Word, but, through this
          means, of reviving, on heathen shores, those dissensions which have
          distracted and retarded the cause of the Redeemer at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, another evil of this course is, that it leads to the
          circulation of versions that teach known and soul-destroying errors.
          It will be perceived that the rule governing Paedobaptists is one of
          expediency. They do not require that the Word of God be faithfully
          translated, but that it be made to suit the majority. All the
          translator has to do is, to ascertain what is expedient. It may be
          expedient to transliterate other words, and the rule adopted does not
          prevent him from doing it. This word may refer to faith, or something
          else that is fundamental, and the withholding of which may peril the
          soul. But I need not dwell on what might be; I will simply show what
          is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spanish Testament employs the words, &quot;Hacer penitencia,&quot;
          as the translation of the Greek word metanoew, to express the duty of
          repentance as enjoined in the original. But these words signify
          &quot;to do penance,&quot; and are thus understood by the Spaniards
          themselves. When they wish to express our idea of repentance, they use
          the word &quot;arrepentirse.&quot; Yet this version is circulated and
          sustained by the American Bible Society. But how did they come to
          translate it so? Simply by abandoning the correct principle of
          Biblical translation. Instead of taking the Hebrew and the Greek as
          the standard, they took the Latin Vulgate, which is a Roman Catholic
          version, and translated from that; and, as expediency was their rule,
          they found it expedient to suit the Catholics; and therefore the Pope
          permits it to be used, while he is mortally opposed to Protestant
          versions of the Holy Scriptures; and thus the money of Protestants is
          taken to promote Romanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me here state another fact, that should make the ears of every
          Paedobaptist tingle with shame. While the American Bible Society was
          circulating this Catholic version, with money contributed by
          Protestants, they refused to aid, as they had been doing, the
          Baptists, in faithfully translating the Word of God, though they were
          generous contributors to their funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same Spanish version, printed and circulated by the American
          Bible Society, Hebrews 11:21, reads thus: &quot;By faith, Jacob, about
          to die, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped the top
          of his staff.&quot; The idea conveyed to the mind of a Roman Catholic
          by this verse is the worship of an image on the top of his staff; and
          thus absolute idolatry is sanctioned and propagated by the Society
          which, with holy horror, withdraws its aid from Baptist missionaries,
          because they would translate all the Word of God, the words relating
          to baptism not excepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we push our reasoning a little further. Suppose the Paedobaptists
          only claim the right to transliterate the words relating to baptism.
          If they have a right to do this, then any denomination has a right to
          transliterate those words, which, if translated, would be fatal to its
          peculiar views.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Roman Catholic may transliterate the Greek word metanoew and have
          Luke 13:3 read, &quot;Except you metanoeo, you shall all likewise
          perish;&quot; and the priest can explain it to &quot;do penance;&quot;
          and the Pope might contribute to the support of a Bible Society that
          would agree to transliterate every word that does not suit him when
          translated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Unitarian may transliterate Qeos, and have John 1:1 read, &quot;In
          the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word
          was theos;&quot; and the minister can explain it to mean &quot;a
          superior, intelligent creature.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Universalist may transliterate aiwnion, teleutaw, etc., and have
          Matthew 25:26 read, &quot;These shall go away into aionion
          punishment;&quot; and the minister can explain it to mean &quot;the
          grave!&quot; Or they can have Mark 9:44 read, &quot;Where their worm
          never dies, and the fire is not sbennutai.&quot; Then the preacher can
          explain it to mean, &quot;where their worm &#x27;troubles&#x27; not
          and the fire is not &#x27;hurtful.&#x27;&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this would be as justifiable, as for the Paedobaptist to
          transliterate baptizw, and then explain it to suit his own views. And
          further, if Paedobaptists have a right to withhold a part of
          God&#x27;s Word, because a part is opposed to their teachings, then
          Rome has a right to withhold all, because all is opposed to her
          teachings; and again Protestantism is found bolstering up Popery. I
          proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          Iii. The Baptists aim to restore and establish the principle of the
          text. Baptists only desire to know and to teach God&#x27;s
          commands—and they desire that all others may know them. They aim,
          therefore, in giving the Bible to the world, to follow the Divine
          requirement given. in the text: &quot;Write the vision and make it
          plain, that he may run who reads it.&quot; In all their efforts to
          spread the Gospel, they have endeavored faithfully to translate the
          Word of God, from the original, into the language of the people;
          seeking to make it so plain, that if a copy of their translation
          should fall into the hands of a person who has no living teacher near
          him, he could ascertain from it all the commands of God. The
          instructions given to their missionaries by the Baptist Board of
          Foreign Missions, are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That the Board feel it to be their duty to adopt all
          prudent measures to give to the heathen the pure Word of God in their
          own language, and to furnish their missionaries with all the means in
          their power to make their translations as exact a representation of
          the mind of the Holy Spirit as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Resolved, That all the missionaries of the Board who are, or who
          shall be, engaged in translating the Scriptures, be instructed to
          endeavor, by earnest prayer and diligent study, to ascertain the
          precise meaning of the original text, to express that meaning as
          exactly as the nature of the languages into which they shall translate
          the Bible will permit, and to transliterate no words which are capable
          of being literally translated&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What a contrast does this present to the resolutions adopted by the
          Paedobaptists! To this principle of faithful translation, the Baptists
          have always strenuously adhered. Efforts have been made to induce
          their missionaries to abandon it, but these have been in vain. When
          their versions have been translated, and ready for the press, money
          has been offered to print, if they would conceal a part of God&#x27;s
          Word, by transliteratering certain words.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 17th of April, 1836, at a meeting of the managers of the
          American Bible Society, the sum of $5,000 was appropriated to the
          Baptist Board of Foreign Missions, to promote the circulation of the
          Scriptures in foreign tongues, which &quot;money would be paid over,
          if our foreign versions were conformed, in the principles of their
          translation, to the common English version;&quot; that is,
          transliterate, and not translate, the words relating to baptism. The
          grant was conscientiously refused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Efforts of a similar kind were made by the British and Foreign Bible
          Society to procure the transliteration of the words in the Bengali
          version. But all was in vain; the Baptists loved the correct principle
          too well to abandon it for the hope of a mere temporary advantage,
          which would, in the end, paralyze their efforts in the conflict with
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these versions of the Baptists had been proved unfaithful, it would
          have been different; there would then have been some show of reason in
          the course pursued by the Paedobaptists. This, however, was not the
          case; their great defect was, that they were not so mutilated as to
          make it possible for Paedobaptists to teach their views to the
          heathen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, if Baptists had mutilated God&#x27;s Word to make it teach their
          own sentiments, it would have been different. But they were never
          guilty of this, nor have they even been charged with it. How then did
          the Paedobaptists seek to justify themselves? Why, they raised the cry
          that they were sectarian versions; which, when examined, simply means,
          that the faithful translation of God&#x27;s Word teaches just what
          Baptists practice, and condemns the practice of Paedobaptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, neither smiles nor frowns, threats nor bribes, flattery nor
          slander—can move us from our attachment to God&#x27;s Word, and our
          obedience to his requirement to give his will, faithfully translated,
          to all the nations of the earth. Our conflict with error may be long,
          but we have no doubts as to the final outcome. God has honored, and
          will honor, those that honor him; and in no way can we honor him more
          highly than in a firm and constant adherence to faithful translations
          of his Holy Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what I have submitted, it will be perceived that sprinkling and
          infant baptism, have led to this desire for the mutilation of
          God&#x27;s Word; and that those who adhere to this perversion of
          God&#x27;s ordinance, are giving their sanction to the abandonment of
          the correct principle of Biblical translation. Their example, their
          influence, and their money, go to support these mutilated versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, I remark, that the Paedobaptist rule of non-translation of
          certain words, like their appeal to tradition, paralyzes their power
          to combat Humanism. How can they condemn the Popish practice of
          denying the Bible to the people, when they adopt the very principle of
          Popery? The Roman Catholic priest can say: &quot;We only keep back
          what is opposed to our practice, and you, Paedobaptists do the
          same.&quot; What could a Protestant Paedobaptist translator say to
          this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, this question about baptism is not so insignificant, seeing it
          involves such great consequences! If the magnitude of a thing is to be
          judged of by its results, it is certain that the question of baptism
          is one of vast importance. As such, I urge the investigation of it
          upon every honest man. At all events, from the printed resolutions
          which I have quoted, all must perceive that the correct principle of
          Biblical translation is with the Baptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding this lecture, I invite your attention to one or two
          inferences from the text: &quot;Write this vision and make it plain,
          that he may run who reads it.&quot; I infer, that all we are to
          believe and practice is made plain in the Word of God, unless obscured
          in the translation. Infant baptism, therefore, either was never
          commanded by Jehovah, or else it has been obscured in the translation
          of his Word; for none, with the teaching of the Bible alone would ever
          discover it to be their duty to have children baptized. Those,
          therefore, who practice infant baptism, ought strenuously to contend
          for a faithful translation, that the obscurity which conceals this
          duty from the common reader may be removed. But I find that
          Paedobaptists oppose faithful translations; I therefore conclude that
          God never commanded infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          I infer, again, that we are to follow that which is plainly taught in
          the Bible, rather than what is doubtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romanist may tell me that I ought to pray to the Virgin Mary, and
          seek the intercession of the saints; but while I read the plain
          declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;There is one God, and one
          Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,&quot; I will
          follow the Bible, and let the Roman Catholic go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Unitarian may tell me, that Christ is not God; but while I read
          the plain declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;I and my Father are
          one,&quot; &quot;He who has seen me, has seen the Father,&quot; I will
          follow the Bible, and let the Unitarian go.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Universalist may tell me that there will be no future punishment;
          but while I read the plain declaration of God&#x27;s Word, &quot;these
          shall go away into everlasting punishment,&quot; I will follow the
          Bible, and let the Universalist go.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, too, the Paedobaptist may tell me that infants ought to be
          baptized; but while I read the plain declaration, &quot;He who
          believes and is baptized, shall be saved,&quot; &quot;Repent, and be
          baptized every one of you,&quot; I will follow the Bible and let the
          Paedobaptist go. Our duty is plain; for God has said, &quot;Write the
          vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run who reads
          it.&quot;

        </p>
        <p>
          All professed Christians, who admit that the Scriptures contain a
          model for church organization, strenuously maintain that the
          denomination with which they are connected, is formed after the
          Scriptural pattern. This is true alike of Episcopalians,
          Presbyterians, Methodists, and all others. But it is abundantly
          evident, that while these denominations are so very dissimilar, they
          cannot all resemble one Scriptural model. It is further evident, that
          some who make pretensions to be &quot;THE CHURCH,&quot; are not
          satisfied to rest their claim to that title, simply on a comparison of
          their organization with the New Testament pattern of a Gospel church,
          but very gladly seek to bring in evidence from other quarters, by
          which they hope to support their cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fathers, Tradition, Expediency, are all pressed into their
          service, to supply the lack of evidence afforded in Scripture; or, as
          is sometimes the case, to nullify and render powerless its direct
          testimony against them. All this I say, is done by those who profess
          to find, in the New Testament alone, a warrant for their
          ecclesiastical systems and organizations. They do not seem to
          perceive, that the very course which they adopt to support their
          claims, affords most conclusive evidence that they are false and vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while some appeal to Tradition, and others to Expediency, it is
          the glory of the Baptists that they act on the principle of the
          sufficiency of the Bible in testing this, as well as all other
          questions relating to religion. Though Jewish antiquity, and the
          Fathers, yield as much or more support to their distinctive features,
          as to those who are most clamorous in demanding submission to them,
          still they prefer to appeal to &quot;the law and to the
          testimony.&quot; I announce, as the Sixth Feature of the reform at
          which Baptists aim, The restoration of the order of the primitive
          churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is certain that primitive church order has been generally
          abandoned, from the fact that so many different organizations exist,
          each claiming to be the gospel church. Now, it is evident that not
          more than one of these dissimilar organizations can be constructed
          after the Scripture model. All that is necessary in testing their
          claims is, to compare them with the New Testament description of a
          gospel church. And any body of Christians that is unwilling to be
          brought to this test must of course give up this claim. Let us
          inquire,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. what was the strict order of the primitive churches? We can only
          obtain satisfactory information on this point from the Word of God.
          The text and its connection present to us the circumstances under
          which the first gospel church was formed. From this it will be
          perceived, that first, the gospel was preached, then repentance and
          baptism were urged upon the hearers; &quot;then they that gladly
          received the Word were baptized; and the same day there were added
          unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued steadfastly
          in the apostles&#x27; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of
          bread, and in prayers. And the Lord added daily to the church such as
          should be saved.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Primitive Churches were composed only of professed believers.
          Those who &quot;gladly received the word.&quot; In all the epistles to
          the churches it will be seen that the members composing them are
          addressed as &quot;believers,&quot; &quot;saints,&quot; &quot;chosen
          ones,&quot; &quot;partakers of like precious faith&quot; with the
          apostles; and even where their sins are spoken of, they are alluded to
          as &quot;brethren,&quot; who had departed from the faith. Dr. Dwight
          says, &quot;There is but one character given in the New Testament to
          those who were church members, and that is the character of
          Christians. There is no mixture of any other character.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Primitive churches were composed only of baptized believers. By
          baptized, I mean immersed believers. &quot;They that gladly received
          his word were immersed.&quot; This is the translation—in the common
          version we have only a transliteration. Let me, on this point, give
          you a few authorities for this translation, as there are some who deny
          its correctness—none, however, of any eminence as scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The learned Bossuet says: &quot;Baptism was performed by plunging. In
          fine, we read not in Scripture that baptism was otherwise
          administered; and we are able to make it appear, that for thirteen
          hundred years baptism was thus administered throughout the whole
          church, as far as possible.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Doddridge says: &quot;&#x27;Buried with him by baptism.&#x27; It
          seems the part of candor to confess that here is an allusion to the
          manner of baptizing by immersion, which was the primitive mode.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          John Wesley says: &quot;&#x27;Buried with him,&#x27; alluding to the
          ancient manner of baptizing by immersion.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitby, author of a Commentary on the New Testament and more than
          forty other learned works, says: &quot;It being so expressly declared
          here, that we are buried with Christ in baptism, by being buried under
          water, and the argument to oblige us to a conformity to his death, by
          dying to sin, being taken from hence; and this immersion being
          observed by all Christians for thirteen centuries; and the change of
          it into sprinkling without any allowance from the Author of this
          institution, being that which the Romanist still urges to justify his
          refusal of the cup to the laity; it were to be wished that this custom
          might be again of general use.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Chalmers says: &quot;The original meaning of the word baptism is
          immersion; and we doubt not that the general style of administration
          in the apostles&#x27; days was by an actual submerging of the whole
          body under water.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Archbishop Tillotson says: &quot;Anciently those who were baptized
          were immersed and buried in water, to represent their death to sin;
          and then did rise up out of the water to signify their entrance upon a
          new life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I might go on and fill a volume with similar quotations, from every
          scholar of any note who has ever written upon the subject. In addition
          to this, every lexicon of note gives it a meaning, which signifies
          either an immersion into an element, or a complete overwhelming with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident, also, from the narration of circumstances connected
          with baptism in the New Testament, that immersion was the primitive
          mode.
        </p>
        <p>Christ, when he was baptized, came up out of the water.</p>
        <p>
          When Philip baptized the eunuch, he went down into the water with him,
          in order to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Paul, in alluding to baptism, twice calls it a burial, and
          once a burial and resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who became members of the primitive churches were admitted by
          immersion; and as none were admitted but believers, none but believers
          were immersed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the Primitive Churches none were admitted to the Lord&#x27;s
          table but those who were immersed. Though they were, at the time of
          their conversion, members of the Jewish nation, or, as a Paedobaptist
          would say, of the Jewish church, and had been circumcised in their
          infancy, still they must be immersed before becoming members, or
          enjoying the privileges of a Christian church. Yes, even though they
          had been proselytes to the Jewish religion, and were circumcised after
          they arrived at maturity, they must still be immersed, when they
          professed faith in Christ, before they could sit down at the
          Lord&#x27;s table. It is admitted by all, to have been the practice of
          the primitive churches, to receive none but the baptized to the
          Lord&#x27;s table.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The primitive churches were independent in their government. All
          the members were on an equality in each church, and each church was on
          the same equality with every other church. There were no bishops, in
          the sense in which that term is used by Roman Catholics,
          Episcopalians, and Methodists. There were no church sessions,
          presbyteries, assemblies, synods, or conferences. Advisory councils,
          having no power to legislate, were sometimes called to give counsel in
          difficult matters. But individual churches possessed supreme authority
          to administer discipline, and transact their own business. The church
          was the highest court of appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Paedobaptists have universally departed from the strict order of
          the Primitive Churches. The first Paedobaptist church was the Church
          of Rome. I presume I need not stop here to show that the Romish church
          does not conform to the Scripture model. All Protestants will affirm
          that she does not; and any one who will read the Bible will be
          convinced of it. Let me remind them, however, that in nothing is her
          dissimilarity to gospel churches more palpably manifest than in her
          infant baptism; and in this thing all Paedobaptists are treading in
          her path, while not one of them is conformed to the New Testament
          pattern. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are not composed of the same materials. They number among
          their members, others than professed believers. Every Paedobaptist
          church holds that the children of believers, when they are baptized,
          are members of the church, and form a part of it. I substantiated this
          assertion by numerous quotations from printed documents, in my lecture
          on the &quot;Spirituality of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom.&quot; I need not,
          therefore, repeat them here. But I remark, in addition to this, that
          conversion is not necessarily a qualification for membership in most
          Paedobaptist churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Episcopalians, admission to full church privileges is granted to
          those who have been confirmed. The requirements for this service are
          thus stated in their Book of Common Prayer: &quot;The Church has
          thought good to order, that none shall be confirmed but such as can
          say the Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and
          can also answer to such other questions as in the Short Catechism are
          contained.&quot; The conditions of admission being thus made,
          irrespective of personal character, it cannot be expected that the
          Episcopal church will bear a comparison with that of primitive times.
          Indeed, it will be perceived that all that is needed is a good memory,
          in order to be confirmed as a member of that church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Presbyterians acknowledge in their standard, that &quot;the
          visible church consists of all those throughout the world that profess
          the true religion, together with their children.&quot; They further
          say, &quot;Children born within the pale of the visible church, and
          dedicated to God in baptism, are under the inspection and government
          of the church, and are to be taught to read and repeat the Catechism
          the Apostles&#x27; Creed, and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. They are to be
          taught to pray, to abhor sin, to fear God, and to obey the Lord Jesus
          Christ. And when they come to years of discretion, if they be free
          from scandal, appear sober and steady, and to have sufficient
          knowledge to discern the Lord&#x27;s body, they ought to be informed
          it is their duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s
          supper.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in all this there is nothing said about regeneration, repentance,
          or faith. The late Dr. Chalmers, a distinguished Presbyterian
          minister, maintained that it was &quot;wrong to say that none but the
          pious should be admitted to partake of the sacraments,&quot; while,
          for the decent regulation of the church, &quot;it is well that the
          visibly profane or profligate are kept away.&quot; As to the duty of a
          minister to the &quot;great majority of our species,&quot; who are
          &quot;neither of the profligate or the pious,&quot; his business is,
          &quot;not to exclude them, but to warn them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A church formed on such principles as these certainly cannot claim to
          be identical with the primitive churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Methodist body, it is held that a religious society is &quot;a
          company of men, having the form and seeking the power of godliness,
          united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation,
          and to watch over one another in the Lord, that they may help each
          other to work out their salvation.&quot; &quot;There is one condition
          previously required of those who desire admission into these
          societies—a desire to flee the wrath to come, and to be saved from
          their sins.&quot; It is well known that persons who give no evidence
          of conversion are often allowed, and even urged, to become &quot;class
          members;&quot; and these &quot;seekers,&quot; as they are termed, are
          admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table. It is not necessary according to
          the Discipline, that a man should give evidence of conversion. It is
          certainly not impossible for unconverted men to fulfill a term of
          probation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus, in almost every Paedobaptist church it may be seen, that
          conversion is not absolutely insisted on as a condition of membership
          on the part of adult applicants.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shall we say of their infant membership? We frequently hear
          of the &quot;children of the covenant,&quot; and the &quot;children of
          the church,&quot; from Paedobaptist pulpits, but do we hear anything
          of this kind in the New Testament? Do we find unconverted men
          addressed as members of the church in primitive times, or young
          persons urged to fulfill baptismal vows, made for them by their
          parents, when they were unconscious infants? No, no! We see parents
          urged to bring their children up in &quot;the nurture and admonition
          of the lord,&quot; but we nowhere find this duty enforced by any
          allusion to vows made at the dedication of their children in baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, those who united with the primitive churches came into them
          voluntarily. It was not necessary to look about, and see who were
          &quot;free from scandal,&quot; and tell them that it was &quot;their
          duty and privilege to come to the Lord&#x27;s table;&quot; but,
          constrained by the love of Jesus Christ, they voluntarily sought to
          profess his sacred name. &quot;Here is water, what hinders me to be
          baptized?&quot; &quot;If you believe with all your heart, you
          may.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Paedobaptists do not receive their members by the same initiatory
          rite that the primitive churches did. The primitive churches received
          their members by immersion. This was the act by which they publicly
          &quot;put on Christ&quot; before the world. A great many Paedobaptist
          authors acknowledge that the primitive saints were immersed, and that
          immersion is the proper signification of the terms which are used to
          designate the ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to those already quoted, I remark that Calvin says:
          &quot;Here we perceive how baptism was administered among the
          ancients; for they immersed the whole body in water.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Taylor says: &quot;The custom of the ancient churches was not
          sprinkling, but immersion; in pursuance of the sense of the word in
          the commandment, and the example of our blessed Savior.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we know that Paedobaptist churches receive the majority of their
          members, not by immersion, but by sprinkling. Some may be immersed,
          but it is only after every argument to dissuade them from it has
          failed. The practice of these churches is sprinkling, the exceptions
          are immersion. In the primitive churches there was &quot;one Lord, one
          faith, one baptism;&quot; and that was immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is a striking dissimilarity between all Paedobaptist
          churches and the primitive churches. The latter were composed of
          immersed believers. The former are composed of a mixed multitude of
          believers and unbelievers, sprinkled, poured, and immersed. The
          language addressed to the primitive churches cannot be addressed to
          them. &quot;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
          put on Christ.&quot; Have infants put on Christ? &quot;Therefore we
          are buried with him by baptism into death.&quot; Can any Paedobaptist
          minister address his church thus? &quot;Buried with him in baptism,
          wherein also you are risen with him through faith of the operation of
          God.&quot; Can this language be appropriately addressed to a
          Paedobaptist church? No! so far from it, many Paedobaptists do not
          like to read it in their Bibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still further; a Paedobaptist preacher cannot stand up, in a
          Paedobaptist community, and address unconverted men as the primitive
          disciples did: &quot;Repent, and be baptized, every one of you.&quot;
          They have been baptized, as they call it, already. From all this it is
          evident that Paedobaptist churches are very dissimilar to the churches
          in the times of the apostles, and to the teachings of the New
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is a wide dissimilarity between Paedobaptist churches and the
          primitive churches, in reference to the Lord&#x27;s Supper. In the
          primitive churches, all who were baptized, and members of the church,
          were admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table. None, who were considered
          proper subjects of baptism, and who had received that rite, were
          excluded from the communion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Paedobaptists contend that infants are proper subjects of baptism,
          and that sprinkling is the proper mode. Every infant who is sprinkled,
          then, according to their view, is properly baptized, and is a member
          in the visible church and ought, according to their own reasoning, to
          be admitted to the Lord&#x27;s table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paedobaptists are most inveterate closed communionists. They are very
          eloquent against the bigotry and closeness of the Baptists, for not
          admitting members of Paedobaptist churches to the Lord&#x27;s table;
          but surely they should not expect us to receive persons whom we
          consider unbaptized, when they will not receive their own baptized
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          All whom we consider baptized, and who are members of our churches, we
          receive; so did the primitive churches. But Paedobaptists have large
          numbers, whom they consider baptized members of their churches, whom
          they do not admit to the Lord&#x27;s table. This is a kind of
          &quot;closed communion&quot; that we have never practiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is a dissimilarity in the government of Paedobaptist churches
          and the primitive churches. One was independent; the other is
          arbitrary, despotic, and tyrannical. I exhibited this fully in my
          lecture on the &quot;Equality of Christ&#x27;s Disciples,&quot; and
          therefore need not repeat the arguments here.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Baptists aim to Restore the Order of the Primitive Churches. They
          make no appeal to Tradition, the Fathers, or Expediency. They simply
          ask, &quot;What do the Scriptures teach?&quot; They follow the New
          Testament model of a church, and invite all to test them by it. It is
          not strange, therefore, that they confidently appeal to God&#x27;s
          Word for proof of the correctness of all they do. They take it all
          from the Bible, and therefore they know it can all be found there.
          Take any Scripture account of the course pursued by the apostles, or
          of the practice of gospel churches, and you will find the counterpart
          in a Baptist church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, they are composed of immersed believers.
          Show us an instance of the baptism of an infant in the primitive
          churches, and we will then baptize infants. But until you do, we will
          oppose infant baptism as an innovation of man, having no divine
          authority, and therefore sinful, when performed in the name of
          Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, Baptists admit none to the Lord&#x27;s
          table but those who are immersed on profession of their faith. Show us
          an instance of a gospel church doing otherwise, and we will conform to
          the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the primitive churches, Baptists are independent in their
          government. Show us a pope, or bishop, or conference, or synod, or
          presbytery, or council, authorized to govern the church, and we will
          submit to just such authority as you can show us in the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our position in these matters is illustrated by a narrative contained
          in a tract, published by the American Tract Society, entitled
          &quot;Mick Healy, the Bible Reader.&quot; Mick had been a strict Roman
          Catholic for fifty years. One day he accidentally found a Bible, and
          commenced reading it. The more he read, the more he neglected the
          Romish service. The priest at length heard of it, and visited Mick,
          and sought to get the Bible from him. Failing in this, he began to
          expostulate with him. He told him he must not read it any more; and
          reminding him that he had not been to confession for a long time, he
          told him he must come and confess, for it was his duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mick held out the Bible to the priest, and said, &quot;Will your
          reverence please show it to me in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is just what we say to all the arguments of Paedobaptists.
          They tell us that all Christian parents should have their infant
          children sprinkled. We say, &quot;Will you please show it to us in the
          Book.&quot; They tell us that sprinkling will do as well as to go
          &quot;down into the water,&quot; and be &quot;buried in baptism,&quot;
          and &quot;come up out of the water.&quot; We say, &quot;Will you
          please show it to us in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          After some time, Mick united with a Protestant church, and regularly
          attended the Sunday-school. The children used frequently to gather
          round him, and put questions to him, to hear his answers:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Well, Mick, why don&#x27;t you now pray to the Virgin
          Mary?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Because it is not in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why don&#x27;t you now confess your sins to Peter and Paul,
          Mick?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Because it is not in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why do you believe the Bible to be sufficient to make you wise
          unto salvation, without tradition?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, sure, it is all in the Book.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          &quot;Must everything in religion be proved by the Bible, Mick?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Yes; whatever is not so, is only moonshine.&quot;</p>
        <p>
          Now our Paedobaptist friends ask us why we do not sprinkle infants; we
          reply, &quot;It is not in the Book!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They wish to know why we &quot;go down into the water,&quot; and
          immerse those who believe, and &quot;come up out of the water.&quot;
          We reply, with Mick, &quot;Oh, sure, it is all in the Book.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          They ask us why we do not admit to the Lord&#x27;s table those who are
          unbaptized. We reply, &quot;It is not in the Book; and whatever is not
          in the Book is only moonshine.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to be Bible Christians, and to make our churches Bible
          churches. In upholding Baptist sentiments, we simply aim to perpetuate
          primitive Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We resemble the primitive Christians in another respect—we are
          &quot;everywhere spoken against.&quot; This we expect, so long as men
          follow Tradition rather than the Word of God, and are influenced by
          the teachings of men, rather than by the example of Christ. But, when
          the Bible, and especially the Bible faithfully translated, is made the
          standard, then we shall triumph. We make no arrogant assumptions; we
          utter no idle boast; but we simply use the language of humble
          confidence and firm faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The progress of the Baptist denomination can be arrested only by
          taking the Bible away from the people; for, while they possess that,
          in spite of priests and princes, scaffolds and faggots, tortures and
          death—some will be found, as in all ages some have been found, who
          will contend for primitive simplicity, primitive purity, primitive
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Paedobaptism can only succeed by withholding the
          Bible from the people, or veiling the command to be immersed in an
          unknown tongue, or calling human tradition to support it, and
          enlisting carnal weapons to defend it. But its days are numbered; it
          is in its decline. Its end approaches; and soon will be heard the
          vocal shout, &quot;Babylon the great is fallen, fallen,&quot; and
          Rome, and all that is Romish, infant baptism and all, shall be
          destroyed! And so let it be!
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not imagine, from these remarks, that I cherish any feelings of
          animosity toward those who practice infant baptism. No; far from it, I
          sincerely pity them. Especially do I pity the priests and ministers
          who are engaged in defending it. So much labor in vain—so much pains
          for nothing. Has not Christ said, &quot;Every plant which my heavenly
          Father has not planted shall be rooted up!&quot; Oh, how much better
          to come out on Gospel ground, take the Bible and follow Christ, and
          enjoy the sweet and abiding confidence that you have done what is
          right!

            >God&#x27;s Displeasure with Those Who Remain Sinfully Neutral in a
            Work of Reform</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Curse Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, Curse bitterly the
          inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to
          the help of the Lord against the mighty.&quot; Judges 5:23
        </p>
        <p>
          In almost every work of Reform there have been those who, while their
          judgments have been convinced of the correctness of the views of the
          reforming party, have, nevertheless, ingloriously consulted their own
          ease, and have chosen to occupy a neutral position during the
          struggle, and thus be prepared, at the termination of the conflict, to
          avoid the reproach of the Reformers, if unsuccessful; or share their
          honors, if triumphant.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this indolent spirit that actuated the inhabitants of Meroz,
          who were anathematized by Jehovah for the course they adopted. Those
          who are here referred to, were Israelites; their nation had been
          mightily oppressed for twenty years by Jabin, the king of Canaan. This
          was during the time that Deborah judged Israel. Wearied with
          oppression, the descendants of Abraham cried unto the Lord for
          deliverance. He heard their cry, and directed them to go forth against
          Sisera, the captain of the host of Jabin, promising to deliver their
          enemies into their hand. The Merozites, desiring to retain the favor
          of the Canaanites, who were very powerful, and yet not wishing to bear
          arms against their brethren, remained at home, and occupied a position
          of shameful neutrality. Meanwhile. the hosts of Israel, under Barak,
          having vanquished their enemies, returned in triumph, with songs of
          thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the indolent, time-serving inhabitants of Meroz, learned that they
          could not reject the claims of their country and their God with
          impunity. God was displeased with them; and instead of permitting them
          to share the triumph of their brethren, he places them under his
          malediction, and directs their own countrymen to bitterly execrate
          them: &quot;Curse Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse bitterly
          the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the
          Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.&quot; The Israelites
          were engaged in God&#x27;s work—a work of Reform. The Merozites, who
          should have been interested in that work, and assisted in it, refused
          to do so. For this they were cursed by Jehovah. My theme is,
          God&#x27;s displeasure with those who remain sinfully neutral in a
          work of reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In dwelling on this topic, I will present for your consideration a few
          propositions which will serve to elucidate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. God carries on all Reforms through Human Instrumentality. Ever
          since man fell, the work of Reform has been going on in the world,
          under the direction of Jehovah; and every work that tends to make man
          better and happier, and bring him back to entire conformity to
          God&#x27;s will, is really His work, though carried on by human
          instrumentality. Thus, when he would disseminate the knowledge of his
          will and holy character among mankind, he raised up, and prepared, and
          used the Jewish nation, as the instruments, to whom a revelation of
          himself was entrusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When that nation forgot him, and degenerated into idolatry, he raised
          up prophets to reform them. Elijah, and Isaiah, and Jeremiah, were
          great Reformers. When they, the chosen and peculiar people of God,
          rejected the Messiah, and crucified the Savior as an impostor, he did
          not turn from man, and seek angelic powers; but, through the apostles,
          he called the Gentiles into his kingdom, to be co-workers in the
          world&#x27;s redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the simplicity of Christianity became corrupted by its connection
          with paganism, in the days of Constantine, he still employed human
          instrumentality to testify against this departure from the faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          When, at a later day, the Romish Church had corrupted every doctrine,
          and polluted, by her unholy touch, every ordinance of the Gospel, he
          raised up Luther, Zwingle, Calvin, and others, as the instruments of
          effecting the Protestant Reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these Reformed churches, still retaining somewhat of the spirit
          of Romanism, formed an unhallowed alliance with the State, and
          enlisted carnal weapons in their support—God brought forth the
          Baptists to assert the spirituality of Christ&#x27;s kingdom, and the
          rights of conscience, and the great Bible doctrine of religions
          liberty and individual responsibility to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Christian church had forgotten the great command, &quot;Go,
          teach all nations,&quot; God raised up William Carey, to draw their
          attention to it, and through him originated the sublime work of Modern
          Missions which bids fair to reform the world, and produce a complete
          moral revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, in every reform, God has used human instrumentality; and thus,
          if infant baptism, and sprinkling be a perversion of his ordinance,
          (as we think, in the preceding Lectures we have clearly shown it to
          be,) he will reform it by human instrumentality.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In almost every Work of Reform, some have remained Sinfully
          Neutral. There is a difference, it must be admitted, between sinful
          enmity or direct opposition to a work—and indolent, selfish
          neutrality. It was wrong for the Canaanites to oppress the Israelites;
          but, it is difficult to decide, whether their active opposition was,
          under the circumstances, any more criminal than the inactivity of
          Meroz. The latter knew that it was their duty to aid their brethren.
          They knew they were right, and that they needed assistance; and they
          knew, also, that their neutrality might possibly be the occasion of
          their defeat. Still, they came not up to help them, but left them to
          struggle on alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it has often been, when God&#x27;s servants have gone forth to
          engage in the work of Reform. The correctness of their principles, the
          purity of their motives, the benevolence of their designs—have forced
          the conviction on many who have witnessed their efforts, that they
          were right; and yet they have never moved a hand to aid them, or
          uttered a word to encourage them, but have contented themselves with
          occupying a merely neutral position. They do not openly oppose the
          work; they do not enroll themselves among its enemies; but they are
          not prepared to make the sacrifices which a noble and manly advocacy
          of the truth demands of them. They fear that they may sustain injury
          in their business, perhaps. The most wealthy and influential members
          of the community are opposed to the reformers, and they will withdraw
          their patronage. Or, they dread the sundering of social ties, it may
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their relatives and friends are committed to that which the Reform
          aims to correct or remove, and they cannot bear the thought of
          arraying themselves against the errors which friends love; they esteem
          their relatives more highly than the truth. Or, the open advocacy of
          what they feel to be right, will subject them to reproach. They will
          be called weak-minded, changelings, fanatical, deserters. Or, they
          will be compelled to unite with a weak body, which is greatly in the
          minority, and heavy burdens will rest upon them. Or, they are not
          certain that the efforts of the reforming party will succeed, and they
          dread the disgrace of a defeat. They forget that it is more honorable
          to be defeated while contending for truth, than to be victorious on
          the side of error. These things all combine to lead them to practice a
          time-serving neutrality. Like the Merozites, they come not up to the
          help of the Lord, and thus incur his displeasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was thus in the days of Nehemiah, when he gathered the Jews
          together to build the walls of Jerusalem; &quot;The nobles put not
          their necks to the work of the Lord.&quot; It was thus in the days of
          Christ and the apostles. Thus it was, also, in later times. Who can
          tell how many, during the fierce persecutions under Antiochus
          Epiphanes, the Romish Papacy, and the English Episcopacy, were led to
          adopt a neutral position, and act in direct opposition to what they
          knew to be right? So it is now; many persons see a thing to be right,
          and acknowledge it to be so; and yet they will not come up to the help
          of the Lord, because they must come up &quot;against the mighty.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it has often been with the Reform in which Baptists are engaged.
          A Baptist congregation has seldom been organized for any length of
          time in a Paedobaptist community, without leading many to the
          conclusion that they were more Scriptural and nearer to the Gospel
          pattern, than the Paedobaptists. While some Christians, acting in
          accordance with such convictions, have submitted to immersion, and
          boldly committed themselves to the cause of truth—others, equally
          convinced of the truth, have continued to practice a time-serving
          neutrality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it may be, perchance, with some who read these Lectures.
          Convinced of the evils of infant baptism, and of the necessity and
          importance of its removal, they may choose, still, not to identify
          themselves with those who are laboring to effect what they feel to be
          right. Like Meroz, they will not come &quot;up to the help of the Lord
          against the mighty.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          III. God is necessarily displeased with such conduct. &quot;Curse
          Meroz, curse bitterly the inhabitants thereof.&quot; All sin is
          offensive to God, and occasions his displeasure; but sins against
          light and knowledge, are especially heinous in his sight. Such is the
          nature of the sin we are contemplating—the neglect of known duty. A
          person may oppose a work of reform from conscientious motives, while
          he believes that work to be wrong; but let him be convinced that
          reform is necessary—that the purity of the Church of Christ, the good
          of souls, and the glory of God are connected with its success, and he
          cannot then oppose it without guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man whose judgment is thus convinced about a matter, occupies a far
          different and more responsible position than one who is in doubt
          concerning the propriety of it, or than he himself did before such
          conviction. He cannot remain in a neutral position, without sinning
          against conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose a Romanist is convinced of the errors of Popery; he could not,
          after such conviction, remain in the Romish church, without the
          additional aggravation of sinning against his conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          So of Paedobaptism, or any other error; when a person is convinced
          that it is wrong it becomes his duty to abandon it, and aid those who
          seek to exterminate it. God is always displeased with half-heartedness
          in his service, and some of the severest denunciations of his Word are
          against those who occupy a merely neutral position.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the exercise of this displeasure, God frequently withdraws the
          smile of his countenance. A sense of obligations violated, and duty
          neglected, prevents the enjoyment of his favor; and whether that duty
          be a great or small one, if willfully neglected, God is displeased and
          the soul feels it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sometimes sends temporal afflictions. A man neglects known duty,
          for fear his business will suffer; God brings reverses and losses upon
          him, against which, with all his cunning, he failed to secure himself.
          He consults the wishes of his friends; they prove false to him. He
          dreads to sever himself from his relatives; God removes them from him
          by death. Or, if none of these calamities come upon him, there are
          other consequences which cannot be avoided. Conscience will upbraid,
          and the mind will often be perplexed, and distracted with anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in the event of the success of the reforming party, such are
          always objects of shame and contempt. They are regarded as the mere
          chips and straws that float with the current. They are never depended
          upon in times of trial; and thus they often bring upon themselves more
          keen reproach than the true Reformer ever suffers. He endures reproach
          for the Truth&#x27;s sake; they suffer it justly, for their recreancy
          to the Truth. The Reformer glories in the reproach he is called to
          suffer—it is his honor. They feel that they are dishonored, and
          deserve to be. They are generally disappointed in their expectations,
          and find that their wisdom is but folly, and their gain but loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the Merozites. What did they gain by their sinful neutrality?
          While Israel rejoice and triumph, Meroz is dishonored and execrated.
        </p>
        <p>In concluding these Lectures, permit me to address:</p>
        <p>
          <b>First, those who are members of the Baptist denomination.</b>
          Brethren, great and important principles are involved in our action.
          Let us be faithful to the trust committed to us. On the propagation of
          our principles in this country, depends all that is dear to us as
          Christians, as Americans, as men. The Baptist element alone, in our
          country has preserved religious freedom and the rights of conscience.
          Baptists alone, are prepared consistently and successfully to meet and
          oppose those various and gigantic forms of error, which retard the
          progress and prevent the triumphs of the Gospel. Let us stand
          faithfully by those hallowed truths in defense of which myriads have
          gone to the scaffold and the rack, and firm adherence to which dyed
          even American soil with Baptist blood. Let us come up &quot;to the
          help of the Lord against the mighty,&quot; and effect a complete and
          thorough reform, by the exaltation of pure Bible truth, unmixed with
          human inventions and the traditions of men!

            >Secondly, I address a word to those who are Baptists in sentiment,
            but who are not united with Baptist churches.</b
          >
          Many such are found in almost every community. Why do you tarry? Are
          you not copying the conduct of Meroz? Beware, lest you incur
          God&#x27;s displeasure, by your sinful neglect of known duty.
          &quot;That servant who knew his Lord&#x27;s will, and did it not,
          shall be beaten with many stripes.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Thirdly, those not Paedobaptists.</b> There are large numbers in
          Paedobaptist churches who, while they cannot see that immersion is
          essential to baptism, still do not believe that infants ought to be
          baptized. To such I say, You are convinced that the baptism of infants
          is unscriptural and wrong. Why, then, continue in a church that
          teaches what you know is contrary to the Bible? Further, have you been
          baptized since infancy, yourselves? lf not, then, according to your
          own showing, you have not been scripturally baptized, and you are
          neglecting the first duty of the believer. &quot;He who believes and
          is baptized, shall he saved.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Finally, to those who are Paedobaptists</b> I would say, If you
          have carefully read the preceding Lectures, you certainly can no
          longer wonder at the importance which Baptists attach to the proper
          subjects and mode of baptism. It is connected with views of the
          spirituality of Christ&#x27;s kingdom, and individual responsibility,
          that are far from insignificant in their bearings. Be not surprised,
          then, if, moved with love to Christ, and love to the souls of men,
          they labor to induce investigation on this subject among Christians,
          that Paedobaptists may proselyte themselves to Bible sentiments.
          &quot;Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.&quot;
