          8. A particular church, gathered and completely organized according to
          the mind of Christ, consists of officers and members; and the officers
          appointed by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the church (so
          called and gathered), for the peculiar administration of ordinances,
          and execution of power or duty, which he intrusts them with, or calls
          them to, to be continued to the end of the world, are bishops or
          elders, and deacons.<sup>15</sup>
          <br />
          (15. Acts 20:17, 28; Philemon 1:1)
        </p>
        <p>
          9. The way appointed by Christ for the calling of any person, fitted
          and gifted by the Holy Spirit, unto the office of bishop or elder in a
          church, is, that he be chosen thereunto by the common suffrage of the
          church itself;<sup>16</sup> and solemnly set apart by fasting and
          prayer, with imposition of hands of the eldership of the church, if
          there be any before constituted therein;<sup>17</sup> and of a deacon
          that he be chosen by the like suffrage, and set apart by prayer, and
          the like imposition of hands.<sup>18</sup>
          <br />
          (16. Acts 14:23 17. 1 Timothy 4:14 18. Acts 6:3, 5-6)
        </p>
        <p>
          10. The work of pastors being constantly to attend the service of
          Christ, in his churches, in the ministry of the word and prayer, with
          watching for their souls, as they that must give an account to
          Him;<sup>19</sup> it is incumbent on the churches to whom they
          minister, not only to give them all due respect, but also to
          communicate to them of all their good things according to their
          ability,<sup>20</sup> so as they may have a comfortable supply,
          without being themselves entangled in secular affairs;<sup>21</sup>
          and may also be capable of exercising hospitality towards others;<sup
            >22</sup
          >
          and this is required by the law of nature, and by the express order of
          our Lord Jesus, who has ordained that they that preach the Gospel
          should live of the Gospel.<sup>23</sup>
          <br />
          (19. Acts 6:4; Hebrews 13:17 20. 1 Timothy 5:17-18; Galatians 6:6-7
          21. 2 Timothy 2:4 22. 1 Timothy 3:2 23. 1 Corinthians 9:6-14)
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Although it be incumbent on the bishops or pastors of the
          churches, to be instant in preaching the word, by way of office, yet
          the work of preaching the word is not so peculiarly confined to them
          but that others also gifted and fitted by the Holy Spirit for it, and
          approved and called by the church, may and ought to perform it.<sup
            >24</sup
          >
          <br />
          (24. Acts 11:19-21; 1 Peter 4:10-11)
        </p>
        <p>
          12. As all believers are bound to join themselves to particular
          churches, when and where they have opportunity so to do; so all that
          are admitted unto the privileges of a church, are also under the
          censures and government thereof, according to the rule of Christ.<sup
            >25</sup
          >
          <br />
          (25. 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14-15)
        </p>
        <p>
          15. In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of
          doctrine or administration, wherein either the churches in general are
          concerned, or any one church, in their peace, union, and edification;
          or any member or members of any church are injured, in or by any
          proceedings in censures not agreeable to truth and order: it is
          according to the mind of Christ, that many churches holding communion
          together, do, by their messengers, meet to consider, and give their
          advice in or about that matter in difference, to be reported to all
          the churches concerned;<sup>29</sup> howbeit these messengers
          assembled, are not intrusted with any church-power properly so called;
          or with any jurisdiction over the churches themselves, to exercise any
          censures either over any churches or persons; or to impose their
          determination on the churches or officers.<sup>30</sup>
          <br />
          (29. Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22-23, 25 30. 2 Corinthians 1:24; 1 John 4:1)
