          &quot;καὶ ἀπελεύσονται οὗτοι εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι εἰς
          ζωὴν αἰώνιον.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>A literal translation of this verse is:</p>
        <p>
          &quot;And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the
          righteous into eternal life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Here is a detailed explanation of the Greek words:</p>
        <p>
          καὶ (kai): This is a common conjunction in Greek, typically translated
          as &quot;and.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          ἀπελεύσονται (apeleusontai): This word is a future tense form of the

          κόλασιν (kolasin): This noun means &quot;punishment.&quot; In ancient

        </p>
        <p>
          αἰώνιον (aiōnion): An adjective meaning &quot;eternal&quot; or

        </p>
        <p>
          ζωὴν (zōēn): This noun means &quot;life.&quot; It is often used in

          Provide the key passages about fire, judgment, and the fate of
          unbelievers throughout the entire book of Matthew for context.
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          The Book of Matthew in the New Testament contains several key passages
          that mention fire, judgment, and the fate of unbelievers. These
          passages are significant in the context of Christian eschatology and
          teachings about the end times and judgment. Here is a summary of these
          key passages:
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 3:10-12 (John the Baptist&#x27;s Preaching)</p>
        <p>
          3:10: John the Baptist speaks of the coming judgment, mentioning that
          &quot;The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that
          does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the
          fire.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          3:12: He also speaks of one coming after him (referring to Jesus) who
          will separate the wheat from the chaff, with the chaff being
          &quot;burned with unquenchable fire.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 5:22 (Sermon on the Mount)</p>
        <p>
          In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warns that anyone who says to a
          brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court, and anyone who
          says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 7:19 (Sermon on the Mount)</p>
        <p>
          Similar to John’s message in Matthew 3:10, Jesus says, “Every tree
          that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 13:40-42, 49-50 (Parables of the Kingdom)</p>
        <p>
          13:40-42: In the explanation of the Parable of the Weeds, Jesus
          describes the end of the age as a time when the angels will weed out
          of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil, and
          throw them into the blazing furnace.
        </p>
        <p>
          13:49-50: Similarly, in the Parable of the Net, it is said that at the
          end of the age, the angels will separate the wicked from the righteous
          and throw them into the blazing furnace.
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 18:8-9 (Teachings on Sin and Forgiveness)</p>
        <p>
          Jesus warns that it is better to be maimed or crippled than to have
          two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. Similarly, it
          is better to lose one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the
          fire of hell.
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 23:33 (Jesus Condemns the Religious Leaders)</p>
        <p>
          Jesus condemns the hypocrisy and unbelief of the Pharisees and
          teachers of the law, asking how they will escape being condemned to
          hell.
        </p>
        <p>Matthew 25:41, 46 (The Parable of the Sheep and Goats)</p>
        <p>
          25:41: Jesus, speaking of the final judgment, says to those on his
          left, &quot;Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire
          prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          25:46: As mentioned previously, this verse speaks of the righteous
          going to eternal life and the unrighteous to eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages collectively form a thematic element in Matthew&#x27;s
          Gospel concerning divine judgment, the consequences of unbelief, and
          the imagery of fire as a symbol of punishment. They are set within
          various contexts, including John the Baptist&#x27;s preaching,
          Jesus&#x27; teachings, and parables.

          The specific word Jesus uses for hell is Gehenna in Matthew&#x27;s
          Gospel. Explain the Old Testament background of Gehenna and how the
          context informs our interpretation of Matthew.
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          In the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels, the term
          &quot;Gehenna&quot; is used by Jesus as a metaphor for hell, a place
          of punishment in the afterlife. The word &quot;Gehenna&quot; has its
          roots in the Old Testament and Jewish tradition, which provides
          important context for understanding its use in the Book of Matthew.
        </p>
        <p>Old Testament Background of Gehenna:</p>
        <p>
          The term &quot;Gehenna&quot; originates from the Hebrew phrase
          &quot;Ge Hinnom,&quot; which means &quot;Valley of Hinnom.&quot; This
          valley lies just outside Jerusalem and had a notorious history in the
          Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament times, the Valley of Hinnom was associated with
          the worship of pagan gods, particularly the Canaanite god Molech. This
          worship included the abominable practice of child sacrifice, as
          mentioned in 2 Chronicles 28:3 and 2 Kings 23:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to its association with such detestable practices, the Valley of
          Hinnom came to be seen as a place of evil and curse. By the time of
          Jeremiah, it was referred to as the Valley of Slaughter (Jeremiah
          7:31-32; 19:2-6), prophesying that it would be a place where the
          bodies of the dead would be thrown.
        </p>
        <p>Jewish Tradition and Gehenna:</p>
        <p>
          Between the Old and New Testament periods, Jewish thought further
          developed the concept of Gehenna. It became not just a symbol of
          disgrace and defilement but also a metaphor for divine judgment and
          the fate awaiting the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Jewish apocalyptic literature, Gehenna evolved into a place of
          fiery punishment for the wicked after death, contrasting with the
          destiny of the righteous.
        </p>
        <p>Gehenna in the Context of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel:</p>
        <p>
          When Jesus refers to Gehenna in Matthew (e.g., Matthew 5:22, 29-30;
          10:28; 23:33), he is drawing on this rich background of Gehenna as a
          symbol of judgment and divine retribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus&#x27; use of Gehenna would have been understood by his audience
          within this cultural and religious context as a stern warning about
          the consequences of sin and the reality of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, the references to Gehenna are often in the
          context of ethical teachings, where Jesus emphasizes the severity of
          sin and the need for repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding Gehenna in its historical and cultural context helps
          interpret Jesus&#x27; teachings in Matthew more accurately. It
          underscores the seriousness with which Jesus approached topics of sin,
          judgment, and the necessity of righteous living in view of the coming
          kingdom of God.

          Nouns of action that are qualified as eternal (such as punishment) can
          either indicate that the action continues forever or that the result
          of the action continues forever.
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          You're correct in noting that in Greek, especially in the context of
          Koine Greek (the dialect of Greek used in the New Testament), nouns of
          action that are modified by the adjective "eternal" (αἰώνιος, aionios)
          can be interpreted in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuation of the Action: In this interpretation, αἰώνιος signifies
          that the action itself is ongoing and unending. Applied to Matthew
          25:46, this would mean that the action of &quot;punishment&quot;
          (κόλασις, kolasis) is a continuous, never-ceasing process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permanence of the Result: In this alternative interpretation, αἰώνιος
          is understood as emphasizing the lasting, unending impact or
          consequences of the action. The action might occur within a limited
          time frame, but its effects or results are eternal. Here, the focus is
          not on the duration of the action itself (the act of punishing), but
          on the enduring nature of its outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Greek term αἰώνιος, translated as "eternal," is often at the
          center of these interpretations. Its meaning encompasses both the
          concepts of an unending duration and the age-lasting quality, i.e.,
          pertaining to an age or era. The context in which it is used,
          especially in Biblical texts, is critical to understanding which
          aspect of 'eternity' is being emphasized - the ongoing nature of an
          action or the lasting impact of its result.

          Assume that Matthew portrays the fire as annihilation or utter
          destruction of the wicked. Interpret Matthew 25:46 with Greek on the
          basis of that information.

        <p>
          Assuming the interpretation that the fire mentioned in the Gospel of
          Matthew signifies complete annihilation or utter destruction of the
          wicked, let&#x27;s reexamine Matthew 25:46 with its original Greek
          text and under this specific interpretative lens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greek Text: Καὶ ἀπελεύσονται οὗτοι εἰς κόλασιν αἰώνιον, οἱ δὲ δίκαιοι
          εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον.
        </p>
        <p>
          Literal Translation: &quot;And these will go away into eternal
          punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Interpreting under the Assumption of Annihilation:</p>
        <p>
          κόλασιν αἰώνιον (kolasin aiōnion): The term &quot;κόλασιν&quot;
          (kolasin), which means &quot;punishment,&quot; when interpreted with
          the assumption of annihilation, suggests a final and irreversible
          state rather than a process of ongoing punishment. The focus is on the
          outcome of the punishment rather than its duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          αἰώνιον (aiōnion): Traditionally translated as &quot;eternal,&quot;
          the adjective &quot;αἰώνιον&quot; in this context could be understood
          to emphasize the permanence and irrevocability of the
          punishment&#x27;s effect, rather than its perpetual ongoing nature. If
          the fire leads to annihilation, the &quot;eternal&quot; aspect is in
          the finality and completeness of the destruction, not in a continuous
          experience of punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast with Eternal Life: The verse sets up a contrast between the
          eternal punishment of the unrighteous and the eternal life of the
          righteous. Under the annihilation view, while the righteous experience
          life that is eternal in duration (unending and ongoing), the
          unrighteous experience a punishment that is eternal in consequence
          (complete destruction with no reversal).
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, interpreting Matthew 25:46 under the assumption that the
          fire represents annihilation, the verse would suggest that the fate of
          the unrighteous is an irreversible and complete destruction (eternal
          punishment), as opposed to the unending, continuous life granted to
          the righteous (eternal life).
