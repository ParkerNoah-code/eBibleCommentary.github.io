        <p>
          I am going to ask questions about Revelation. The following
          hermenutical principles must be followed:
        </p>
        <p>
          Brian J. Tabb, All Things New: Revelation as Canonical Capstone, vol.
          48, New Studies in Biblical Theology (Downers Grove: IVP, 2019), 8:
          &quot;Like Jesus and the Old Testament prophets, Revelation presents
          its message in symbolic, pictorial language to unveil true spiritual
          realities compellingly to those with ears to hear... Jesus Christ
          ‘made known’ or ‘signified’ (sēmainō) the revelation to John by
          sending an angel (Rev. 1:1). Similarly, Daniel 2:30, 45 LXX says that
          the mystery of the king’s dream ‘was shown’ (sēmainō) to Daniel and
          ‘the great God has shown [sēmainō] the king what will be at the end of
          the days’ (NETS).&quot;

          Alan Bandy, The Hermeneutics of Symbolism: How to Interpret the
          Symbols of John’s Apocalypse SBJT 14/1 (Spring 2010) 46-58: &quot;In
          other words, if Revelation is prophetic or apocalyptic, ascribing
          literalism to its numbers, proper nouns, and other images may prevent
          adjudicating John’s intended meaning— the literal sense. A more
          profitable hermeneutical approach is to reverse the interpretive order
          by placing the symbolic in the foreground while shifting the literal
          into the background.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bruce Metzger, Breaking the Code: Understanding the Book of Revelation
          (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1999): &quot;This book contains a series
          of word pictures, as though a number of slides were being shown upon a
          great screen. As we watch we allow ourselves to be carried along by
          impressions created by these pictures. Many of the details of the
          pictures are intended to contribute to the total impression, and are
          not to be isolated and interpreted with wooden literalism.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bruce Metzger and David A. deSilva, Breaking the Code Revised Edition:
          Understanding the Book of Revelation (Nashville: Abingdon Press,
          2019), 17-18: &quot;Such accounts combine cognitive insight with
          emotional response... In reporting his visionary experiences, John
          frequently uses symbolic language. Sometimes he explains the meaning
          of the symbols... [I]n attempting to understand John’s symbolism, we
          must consider not only the book itself but also his use of the Old
          Testament... In any case, it is important to recognize that the
          descriptions are descriptions of symbols, not of the reality conveyed
          by the symbols.&quot;
        </p>

          Dennis E. Johnson, Triumph of the Lamb: A Commentary on Revelation
          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2001), 4, 11, 13, 22:
          &quot;Although, as we will see, applying the literal-where-possible
          maxim to prophetic literature is problematic, its inadequacy does not
          mean that Revelation is a wax nose, to be manipulated into any shape
          we choose... The literal meaning of symbolic language is the symbolic
          correspondence between the imagery of the language and the referent
          that it describes... We dare not tackle the symbolism of Revelation
          without immersing our minds in the rich imagery of the Old
          Testament... Revelation makes sense only in light of the Old
          Testament. Not only the visions of such prophets as Ezekiel, Daniel,
          and Zechariah but also historical events such as creation, the fall,
          and the exodus provide the symbolic vocabulary for John’s
          visions.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          G. K. Beale, The Book of Revelation, (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999),
          50-52, 56: &quot;Rev. 1:1 introduces the book... with the word
          &#x27;apocalypse&#x27;... a clear allusion to Dan. 2... The revelation
          is not abstract but pictorial... Dan. 2:28-30, 45 indicates that a
          symbolic vision and its interpretation is going to be part of the warp
          and woof of the means of communication throughout Revelation. This
          conclusion is based on the supposition that John uses OT references
          with significant degrees of awareness of OT context, for which I will
          argue later... [A] number of authors of both popular and scholarly
          commentaries contend that one should interpret literally except where
          one is forced to interpret symbolically by clear indications of
          context... But the results of the analysis above of 1:1 indicate
          that... the essence of the book is figurative [&#x27;1:12-20 and
          4:1-22:5 at the least&#x27;]... The OT and Judaism are the primary
          background against which to understand the images and ideas of the
          Apocalypse.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Grant R. Osborn, Revelation: Baker Exegetical Commentary, (Grand
          Rapids: Baker, 2002): &quot;John deliberately uses... made known
          [&#x27;the verb cognate of the noun “sign” in john’s Gospel&#x27;]...
          in 1:1 because of its parallels with Dan. 2:28-30, 45, where God
          &#x27;signifies&#x27; truths through pictorial or symbolic visions.
          Thus it means to &#x27;communicate by symbols&#x27; and connotes the
          need to interpret the reality behind the symbol... Symbols are
          metaphorical utterances that are meant to be understood first
          pictorially and then referentially... The sources for interpreting
          them come from the OT, intertestamental literature, and the
          Greco-Roman world—in other words, in the common world of the original
          readers in the province of Asia.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vern S. Poythress, The Returning King (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R
          Publishing, 2000), 47: &quot;Some people today come to Revelation with
          the recipe, &#x27;Interpret everything literally, if possible.&#x27;
          That recipe misunderstands what kind of book Revelation is. Of course,
          John literally saw what he says he saw. But what he saw was a vision.
          It was filled with symbols, like the Beast of 13:1–8 and the seven
          blazing lamps in 4:5. It never intended to be a direct, nonsymbolical
          description of the future. People living in John’s own time understood
          this matter instinctively, because they recognized that John was
          writing in an &#x27;apocalyptic&#x27; manner, a manner already as
          familiar to them as a political cartoon is to us today.&quot;
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          It&#x27;s clear that you are approaching the study of the Book of
          Revelation with a specific hermeneutical framework, emphasizing the
          symbolic and pictorial nature of its language. This approach, as
          highlighted by scholars like Brian J. Tabb, Alan Bandy, Bruce Metzger,
          Dennis E. Johnson, G. K. Beale, Grant R. Osborn, and Vern S.
          Poythress, stresses the importance of understanding the symbolism in
          Revelation and its roots in Old Testament imagery and apocalyptic
          literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consistent theme in these scholarly perspectives is the caution
          against a strictly literal interpretation of Revelation&#x27;s
          imagery. Instead, they advocate for a more nuanced understanding where
          the symbolic and metaphorical aspects are given precedence, and the
          literal elements are considered within the context of the symbolism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to ask your questions about Revelation, and I will endeavor
          to provide responses that align with these hermeneutical principles.

          Write out the Greek of Revelation 14:9-11, and give a translation.
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          Certainly, I can provide you with the Greek text of Revelation
          14:9-11, along with a translation. Here is the text in Greek:
        </p>
        <p>Revelation 14:9-11 (Greek Text)</p>
        <p>
          Καὶ ἄλλος, ἄγγελος τρίτος, ἠκολούθησεν αὐτοῖς, λέγων ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ,
          Εἴ τις προσκυνεῖ τὸ θηρίον καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ καὶ λαμβάνει χάραγμα
          ἐπὶ τοῦ μετώπου αὐτοῦ ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς χειρός αὐτοῦ,
        </p>
        <p>
          αὐτὸς καὶ πίεται ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ θυμοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ, τοῦ κεκερασμένου
          ἀκράτου ἐν τῷ ποτηρίῳ τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ βασανισθήσεται ἐν πυρὶ καὶ
          θείῳ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἁγίων ἀγγέλων καὶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀρνίου·
        </p>
        <p>
          καὶ ὁ καπνὸς τοῦ βασανισμοῦ αὐτῶν εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων ἀναβαίνει, καὶ οὐκ
          ἔχουσιν ἀνάπαυσιν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς οἱ προσκυνοῦντες τὸ θηρίον καὶ τὴν
          εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καί εἴ τις λαμβάνει τὸ χάραγμα τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ.
        </p>
        <p>Translation of Revelation 14:9-11</p>
        <p>
          Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, &quot;If
          anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
          forehead or on his hand,
        </p>
        <p>
          he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
          poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation; and he will
          be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy
          angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have
          no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
          receives the mark of his name.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage is part of a larger section in Revelation that uses vivid
          imagery to depict the consequences of allegiance to the beast,
          contrasted with the rewards for those who remain faithful to God.
          Remembering the hermeneutical principles you mentioned, it&#x27;s
          important to interpret these verses within the broader symbolic and
          thematic context of the book.

          Revelation 14:10-11 contains several symbolic images to describe
          divine judgment. Let&#x27;s break down each symbol and provide Old
          Testament contexts for them:
        </p>
        <p>
          Wine of the Wrath of God: Wine often symbolizes God&#x27;s wrath in
          the Old Testament, depicted as a cup that the wicked are made to drink
          as a form of divine retribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Psalm 75:8 - &quot;For in the hand of the Lord there is a
          cup, with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all
          the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Isaiah 51:17 - &quot;Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up,
          O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of
          his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of
          staggering.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cup of His Indignation: The cup is a common metaphor for suffering and
          wrath destined for the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Jeremiah 25:15-16 - &quot;Thus the Lord, the God of Israel,
          said to me: &#x27;Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and
          make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. They shall drink and
          stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among
          them.&#x27;&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Tormented with Fire and Brimstone: Fire and brimstone (sulfur) imagery
          is often associated with divine judgment and destruction, notably in
          the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Genesis 19:24 - &quot;Then the Lord rained on Sodom and
          Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Isaiah 34:9-10 - &quot;And the streams of Edom shall be
          turned into pitch, and her soil into sulfur; her land shall become
          burning pitch. Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall
          go up forever.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Smoke of Their Torment Ascends Forever and Ever: The ascending smoke
          as an eternal sign of destruction and judgment, indicating the
          permanence of God’s judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Isaiah 34:10 (as above) - The enduring smoke is a sign of
          perpetual desolation and judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Genesis 19:28 - Describing the destruction of Sodom and
          Gomorrah, &quot;and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and
          toward all the land of the plain, and he saw and behold, the smoke of
          the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          No Rest Day or Night: This phrase suggests continual torment and lack
          of peace for the wicked, a theme echoed in the Old Testament in the
          context of unrelenting judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Isaiah 48:22 - &quot;There is no peace, says the Lord, for
          the wicked.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These symbols in Revelation 14:10-11 draw heavily from the Old
          Testament, emphasizing the severity and permanence of God&#x27;s
          judgment against sin and rebellion. The imagery is meant to convey the
          serious consequences of aligning with evil (symbolized by the beast
          and his image) in stark contrast to the reward for faithfulness to
          God. As with much of Revelation, these images are symbolic and should
          be interpreted within the broader theological and literary context of
          the Bible.
        </p>

          Is it saying the wicked will never be able to rest again or is it
          saying they will not be able to rest during the entirety of the
          judgment? Explain the Greek in detail.
        </p>
        <p><b>ChatGPT</b></p>
        <p>
          Revelation 14:11 uses the phrase &quot;καὶ οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἀνάπαυσιν
          ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς&quot; (kai ouk echousin anapausin hēmeras kai
          nyktos), which translates to &quot;and they have no rest day or
          night.&quot; To understand the implications of this phrase, especially
          whether it suggests eternal unrest or unrest during the period of
          judgment, we need to look at the Greek words and their uses more
          closely:
        </p>
        <p>
          οὐκ ἔχουσιν (ouk echousin): This phrase means &quot;they have
          not&quot; or &quot;they do not have.&quot; The use of οὐκ (ouk)
          indicates a negation.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἀνάπαυσιν (anapausin): This word translates to &quot;rest&quot; or
          &quot;relief.&quot; In the New Testament, it&#x27;s often used to
          describe a cessation from labor or activity, implying a state of peace
          or comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς (hēmeras kai nyktos): This phrase means &quot;day
          and night.&quot; In biblical literature, &quot;day and night&quot;
          often signifies continual or unceasing activity when used in a context
          like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, interpreting this phrase within the broader context of
          apocalyptic literature and the Book of Revelation, a couple of points
          stand out:
        </p>
        <p>
          Apocalyptic Hyperbole: Revelation is known for its use of hyperbolic
          and symbolic language. The phrase could be an apocalyptic hyperbole,
          emphasizing the severity and unrelenting nature of the judgment
          without necessarily implying eternal torment in a literal sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporal vs. Eternal: The Greek doesn’t explicitly define whether the
          lack of rest is eternal or limited to the duration of the judgment.
          The immediate context (&quot;day and night&quot;) suggests a
          continuous state during a specified period, but it doesn&#x27;t
          clearly delineate if this is a perpetual state beyond the
          eschatological judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, while the Greek text of Revelation 14:11 suggests a
          state of continual unrest during the time of judgment (&quot;day and
          night&quot;), it does not explicitly clarify whether this state is
          eternal or temporal. The interpretation often depends on broader
          theological perspectives and the interpretative approach to
          apocalyptic literature. In a symbolic and metaphorical reading, as
          suggested by the scholars you referenced, the emphasis may be more on
          the gravity and seriousness of the judgment rather than a detailed
          description of its duration or nature.
