        <h2>Conditionalism</h2>
        <p>
          Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
          resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a
          second, irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. Only
          those who are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of
          immortality and eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional belief in the eternal conscious torment of the
          unsaved, whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects
          our interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about
          "death," "destruction," and "perishing" to be interpreted
          metaphorically to refer to seperation from God, pain, or torment even
          though annihilation, extinction, or cessation of consciousness would
          appear be the obvious interpretation of these passages otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we must be careful not to read our presuppositions into the
          text. A thorough examination of passages about hell will reveal if
          eternal torment is taught in Scripture. If it is not taught, the
          belief that the wicked will face a final death after the judgment
          follows naturally from the typical biblical language about hell.
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. It is both authoritative and
          accurate. It is the standard of truth over and against all human
          traditions, philosophies, creeds, councils, and authorities. It is my
          goal to understand the biblical texts about hell in context and to
          leave behind presuppositions or philosophical arguments that don't
          come from the Bible. I don't have a set position for or against
          Annihilationism, I'm still studying the issue, but I do see it as a
          plausible view worth considering seriously after reexamining some of
          the biblical texts which appeared to me to teach the traditional view
          until I examined them critically. I will present positive arguments
          for Annihilationism first and then challenge or defend them as I study
          and revise the article.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain?
          One only needs to consider the time before the Reformation where the
          majority of the visible church was certain that justification was by
          faith and works. It was going back to the Word of God afresh that
          revealed that doctrinal error. So it is certainly possible for many to
          be mistaken about what the Bible teaches, but what in Scripture would
          cause someone to question eternal torment? Well, just laying out
          common biblical language about the final judgment of the wicked sounds
          like Annihilationism:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible clearly states that the righteous will be resurrected and
          given immortality and incorruptibility. In contrast, there is no
          suggestion in the Scriptures that the wicked will be granted either
          immortality or incorruptibility. They will not recieve eternal life
          but perish. They will be excluded from God's presence and cast into
          the lake of fire, where they will undergo the second death.
        </p>
        <p>
          This eternal punishment, the second death, represents the ultimate
          consequence of sin. It entails eternal and complete destruction,
          enacted by God who has the power to annihilate both soul and body in
          hell. This form of punishment means absolute and irreversible
          perishing, in stark contrast to eternal life, which is consistently
          presented in the New Testament as the desirable alternative to death,
          destruction, and perishing.

        <h2>Translation of Hell</h2>
        <p>
          The King James Version translated the words Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and
          Tartarus as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern english.
          The word hell has developed to refer to the place of eternal torment;
          however, it originally only meant a covered or hidden place (think of
          the word "helmet"). There are still many modern translations which do
          this to a certain degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna, the shortended name for the valley of Hinnom, became
          notorious during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh, who committed
          abominable acts there, including the sacrifice of their own children
          by fire to the god Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6). The valley, we
          are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be called a place of
          slaughter, where it was prophesied to be filled with the corpses of
          those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became synonymous
          with extreme divine punishment, where the bodies of the slain were
          left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting a vivid
          picture of desolation and wrath.
        </p>

            >Hell</a

          hence the covered or the invisible place."

            target="_blank"
            >Words Translated As Hell</a
          >. "The word Sheol is used in the Old Testament 65 times. The King
          James Version translates it as grave 31 times, hell 31 times, and pit
          3 times. Can you imagine the same word being translated as both grave
          and hell?"
        </p>

        <h2>Fallacies</h2>
        <p>
          Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman to be
          knocked down with a verse like Matthew 25:46. Both sides affirm
          eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature of that
          punishment. The destruction or annihilation of a person would be an
          irreversible and eternal punishment that forever seperated that person
          from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea
          of people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just
          theological liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people
          begin with these kinds of accusations. The goal is not to
          psychoanalyze the other side but to examine arguments about the
          biblical view of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as
          metaphors for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets
          these descriptions non-literally or metaphocially is not only false,
          it is used rhetorically to discount consideration of the view.
          Destruction and annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on
          fire are consumed and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions
          to mean eternal conscious torment, whether or not that is justified,
          is clearly the metaphorical interpretation of these passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
          character of love and justice: This is a red herring. The focus should
          remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room to
          discuss the justness of it, but this should not be treated as the
          primary argument or motivation behind this view. Moreover, death, not
          eternal torment, is consistently said to be the price of sin, and
          Jesus' death is what saved us at Calvary.

        <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
          created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
          existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live
          on forever. God "can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Mat. 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone
          will go to either heaven or hell for eternity is an assumption that
          must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is sometimes used to
          argue that all people will be raised with immortality and
          incorruptibility, and it is almost the only text used to argue this
          position; however, in context, this chapter is about those who are in
          Christ being raised and says nothing of unbelievers. Verses like John
          3:16 indicate the opposite, that unbelievers are destined to perish.

          of the wicked shall be shortened... The way of Yahweh is a stronghold
          to the upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
          The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in
          the land. The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the perverse
          tongue will be cut off."

        <p>
          The Hebrew word "olam" is commonly translated as "darkness,"
          "eternity," or "the future." The most common interpretation is that
          this verse is about the insatiable longing for and awareness of
          something beyond this world that God has instilled in human hearts.
          Humans possess an inherent sense of something beyond the temporal
          world, a deep-seated recognition of a greater existential reality. Yet
          they are unable to fully understand God's workings or be ultimately
          satisfied in this world. Therefore, this verse does not teach the
          immortality of the soul.

        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna became notorious during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh,
          who committed abominable acts there, including the sacrifice of their
          own children by fire to the god Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6). The
          valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be called a
          place of slaughter, where it was prophesied to be filled with the
          corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became
          synonymous with extreme divine punishment, where the bodies of the
          slain were left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting
          a vivid picture of desolation and wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just physical destruction,
          but the culmination of divine judgment, where the opportunity for
          salvation is irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete
          destruction by God. Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically by using
          strong language about the body and its parts to illustrate the
          seriousness of avoiding sin and its consequences (Matthew 5:22, 29-30,
          18:9). This imagery resonates with the imagery in Isaiah 66:24,
          reinforcing the notion of Gehenna as a place of total annihilation for
          the wicked. This is consistent with Paul who speaks of the ultimate
          fate of the wicked in terms of destruction (Philippians 1:28; 3:18-19;
          Romans 9:22-24; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24, where it clearly states that corpses are
          being consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of
          the worm and fire in Isaiah is not about eternal conscious torment but
          emphasizes the shame and complete destruction of the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never
          die" in other biblical contexts (e.g., Genesis 42:20, Exodus 30:20,
          Jeremiah 38:24). It often means "will not die at a particular time or
          in a particular context." In Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms
          will not die before completely devouring the corpses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that
          burns forever. "Quench" primarily means "extinguish." The fire in
          Isaiah cannot be extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This
          imagery emphasizes the complete and irreversible nature of the
          consumption.

        <h2>Revelation 14:10-11</h2>
        <p>
          "...he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
          prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with
          fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence
          of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They
          have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image,
          and whoever receives the mark of his name."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that the book of Revelation is filled with
          symbolic language and apocalyptic imagery. Much like interpreting a
          parable, the goal is not to analyze the pictoral elements literally
          but to look at what meaning the picture is trying to convey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The torment the wicked experience is not an endless agony, but rather
          an extreme encounter with God's justice at the final judgment. It is
          so terrifying that they are unable to rest day or night while awaiting
          that time. The finality and decisiveness of God's judgment is conveyed
          through fire and brimstone language. Similar to the fall of Babylon
          depicted in Revelation 18, their torment and destruction are a closed
          chapter in history, forever marked by the enduring symbol of rising
          smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Genesis 19:23, 28; Deuteronomy 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isaiah
          30:27-33; 34:9-11; Ezekiel 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive
          annihilation and complete destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in
          its wake. This picture appears to be in stark contrast to
          excruciating, unending suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall how Abraham saw smoke rising from Sodom and Gomorrah,
          signifying their final annihilation (Genesis 19:28). Smoke rising
          forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the wicked. This is
          the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was destroyed by
          fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the everlasting nature
          of its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as a permanent
          reminder of God's final victory over evil.
