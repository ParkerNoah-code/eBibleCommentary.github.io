        <h2>Conditionalism</h2>
        <p>
          Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
          resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a
          second, irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. Only
          those who are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of
          immortality and eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional belief in the eternal conscious torment of the
          unsaved, whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects
          our interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about
          "death," "destruction," and "perishing" to be interpreted
          metaphorically to refer to separation from God, pain, or torment even
          though annihilation, extinction, or cessation of consciousness would
          appear be the obvious interpretation of these passages otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are sufficient translational, exegetical, theological, and
          practical considerations to inspire humility and genuine reflection as
          one studies this weighty and important doctrine. Therefore, both sides
          must be careful to avoid reading presuppositions into the Bible or
          flippantly dismissing those who disagree. Proof-texting without regard
          for context or carefulness is irresponsible and unhelpful. A thorough
          examination of passages about the ultimate end of unbelievers is the
          only way we can reach clarity and certainty on the matter.

          <em>to</em> everlasting life with God. Simultaneously, it is salvation
          <em>from</em> a permanent death (termination of life forever; final
          loss of being)." "More fully expressed, this would mean humans are
          mortal yet capable of immortality (after meeting qualifying
          conditions), or alternatively, immortal yet capable of mortality
          (after meeting disqualifying conditions)." "Our own view is that all
          people will be resurrected, but only some will receive a 'resurrection
          like his,' having 'died to sin' and been 'crucified with him,' in
          order that 'we will also live' and 'never die again,' for 'death has
          no dominion' over him, nor over those who are 'alive to God in Christ
          Jesus' (Rom 6:2-11)."
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. Scripture, being the very
          word of God, is both authoritative and accurate in all that it
          teaches. It is the standard of truth over and against all human
          traditions, philosophies, creeds, councils, and authorities. I don't
          have a set position for or against Annihilationism, I'm still studying
          the issue, but I do see it as a plausible view worth considering
          seriously after reexamining some of the biblical texts which appeared
          to me to teach the traditional view until I examined them critically.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will present positive arguments for Annihilationism first and then
          challenge or defend them as I study and revise the article. I cite
          resources at the bottom of each section when relevant for further
          study and support. Not all the authors cited are Conditionalists,
          though the majority are.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain?
          One only needs to consider the time before the Reformation when the
          majority of the visible church was certain that justification was by
          faith and works. It was going back to the Word of God with an open
          mind to be conformed to its message that revealed that doctrinal
          error. So, it is certainly possible for many to be mistaken about what
          the Bible teaches, but what in Scripture would cause someone to
          question eternal torment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well to start with, the very meaning of the gospel suggests that
          death, not eternal torment, is the price for sin. Everyone is under
          "the law of sin and death" (Rom 8:2), for "the wages of sin is death"
          (Rom 6:23). "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we
          were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8), so that we have "an
          atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood" (Rom 3:25). He, "who was
          delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification" (Rom
          4:25), took the penalty for our sins, that is death, on the cross for
          our justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those whose sins are not covered by the cross will be held accountable
          on judgment day. They will have to suffer the consequences of sin with
          the most serious punishment, capital punishment. They will be excluded
          from God's presence and cast into the lake of fire where they will
          undergo the second death (Rev 20:14). This permanent, final
          punishment, the second death, represents the ultimate consequence of
          sin. It entails eternal and complete destruction from God who will
          annihilate both soul and body in Gehenna (Mat 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          This punishment is put in stark contrast to eternal life, which is
          consistently presented in the New Testament as the desirable
          alternative to death, destruction, and perishing. The Bible clearly
          states that the righteous will be resurrected and given immortality,
          but there is no suggestion in the Scriptures that the wicked will be
          granted immortality. They will not receive eternal life but perish
          (John 3:16). In contrast to this, the historic doctrine of eternal
          torment holds that unbelievers will also be granted eternal, embodied
          life just like believers, and the price for their sins is not death
          but torture.

          good deal of sound, biblical arguments for it."

          from a firm commitment to the truthfulness and perennial relevance of
          the Bible, and not from a desire to have its message be more palatable
          to our own culture. We are not seeking to construct a more tolerable
          version of hell, as though primarily motivated by an emotional
          aversion to the idea of eternal torment. Neither do we assume,
          however, that the correct view of Hell must be whichever is perceived
          to be the harshest and most intolerable."

          texts to work with about the nature of hell, while "conditionalism’s
          <em>sedes doctrinae</em>—its seat of doctrine—can be likened to a
          stool with three legs, each representing a body of biblical texts
          collectively conveying one of these themes: life from death as the
          <em>telos</em> of the gospel; immortality as a gift granted only to
          the saved; and death and destruction as what happens in hell."
        </p>

        <h2>Translation of Hell</h2>
        <p>
          The King James Version translated the words Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and
          Tartarus as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern English.
          The word hell has developed to refer to a place of eternal torment;
          however, it originally only meant a covered or hidden place (think of
          the word "helmet," a covering for your head). There are still many
          modern translations which translate these words inconsistently, but
          Gehenna is the only one that refers to the final fate of the wicked.

          When the Bible says people go to 'hell,' we agree. We just think it

          and soul.' We don’t believe in hell as a place of eternal torment

          as this had place, was not prolonged existence in Sheol, but
          deliverance from it and restoration to new life in God's presence (Job

          The gates of Sheol will not prevail against Christ’s church because
          Jesus has already broken down its doors. All those united to Christ by

          and hell?... By its usage we see that Sheol was considered the place
          or state of all the dead -- whether they were good or bad. When used
          figuratively it could mean the consequences of wickedness in the
          present world, likened to death."

          poet, spoke of 'dark Tartarus...the deepest pit' (Iliad, 8.13). Here
          [2 Peter 2:4], it is used of the abode of evil angels prior to their
          banishment to Gehenna, their ultimate destiny (cf. Mt. 25:41)."
        </p>

        <h2>Gehenna</h2>
        <p>
          Gehenna, the shortened name for the valley of Hinnom, became notorious
          during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh as the location where
          children were sacrificed by fire to the god Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3;
          33:6). The valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would
          be called a place of slaughter where it was prophesied to be filled
          with the corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley
          thus became synonymous with extreme divine punishment, where the dead
          bodies of the slain were left unburied and exposed to decay and
          scavengers, painting a vivid picture of desolation and wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just physical destruction,
          but the culmination of divine judgment where the opportunity for
          salvation is irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete
          destruction by God. Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically to illustrate
          the final death of the wicked (Matthew 5:22, 29-30, 18:9). This
          imagery resonates with Isaiah 66:24, a verse Jesus quotes when
          speaking of Gehenna, reinforcing the notion of Gehenna as a place of
          total annihilation. This is consistent with Paul who speaks of the
          ultimate fate of the wicked in terms of destruction (Philippians 1:28;
          3:18-19; Romans 9:22-24; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).
        </p>
        <p>
          A common myth is that the Valley of Hinnom was a garbage dump that was
          always burning with fire, and therefore provided good imagery for
          eternal torment. However, this is a baseless claim first made by Rabbi
          David Kimhi around A.D. 1200. Although the garbage dump theory is
          commonly stated in study Bibles and commentaries to support the
          doctrine of eternal torment, there is no archeological or literary
          evidence to back it up. The reality is that the Old Testament provides
          the background for Gehenna as a place of slaughter, death, and
          destruction, a stark contrast to the idea of people being tormented
          and never dying.

          being their place of punishment after the last judgment."

            >The Myth of the Burning Garbage Dump of Gehenna</a
          >, 2011: "I have long wanted to do a little work to debunk the
          endlessly repeated myth that the Hinnom Valley (Gehenna) was a
          perpetually burning trash dump. There simply is no evidence to support
          the idea, but because it seems a reasonable explanation for the origin
          of the Hinnom Valley as 'hell,' writers and preachers accept and
          propagate the story."

        <h2>Fallacies</h2>
        <p>
          Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman to be
          knocked down with a verse like Matthew 25:46. Both sides affirm
          eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature of that
          punishment. The destruction of a person is an irreversible and eternal
          punishment. It forever deprives that person of life and eternally
          separates them from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Annihilationists redefine the word eternal: This misunderstands the
          position. Annihilationism is the view that the punishment for sin is
          death, though it does affirm that there is suffering leading up to and
          accompanying that death. Both positions affirm that the consequences
          of sin are indeed eternal. It is not the view that sinners receive the
          punishment of torment for a long time to pay the price of their sins
          before God ends their lives, and it does not teach that God instantly
          annihlates sinners so that they face no pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view must be wrong because Jehovah's Witnesses believe it: This
          isn't even the genetic fallacy. Annihilationism has strong support in
          the early church until the time of Augustine and is becoming more
          common among conservative, Bible-believing Christians now. This is the
          guilt by association fallacy. Just because this position is held by a
          heretical group, doesn't mean that it is wrong or that others hold the
          position for the same reasons. The arguments given here are exegetical
          and based on accepted hermeneutical principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists deny degrees of punishment: It is argued that
          Conditionalism must deny degrees of punishment since the wicked will
          all face the same fate of death in the end. This does not follow
          though. If you want to understand degrees of capital punishment,
          consider the differences between death by lethal injection, firing
          squad, burning at the stake, and crucifixion. In contrast, the
          traditional view is that one sin and a lifetime of sin both merit
          everlasting torment. Both views give an account for degrees of
          punishment, even though the latter view appears to give a much worse
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
          character of love and justice: This is a red herring. The focus should
          remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room to
          discuss the justness of each view, but one's intuition about justice
          should not be treated as the primary argument or motivation for their
          view. Moreover, death, not eternal torment, is consistently said to be
          the price of sin, so it is not hard to understand the belief that
          eternal capital punishment aligns with God's justice. Traditionalists
          also have explanations for why God would be just to inflict eternal
          torment. Ultimately, we must rely on the Bible more than intuition or
          emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea
          of people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just
          theological liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people
          begin with these kinds of accusations. The goal is not to
          psychoanalyze the other side but to examine arguments about the
          biblical view of hell. It may in fact be the traditionalists that are
          not taking the biblical language serious enough through constant
          allegorizing of death, perishing, destruction, fire, Gehenna,
          annihilation, and other corresponding language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as
          metaphors for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets
          these descriptions non-literally or metaphorically is not only false,
          it is used rhetorically to discount consideration of the view.
          Destruction and annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on
          fire are consumed and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions
          to mean eternal conscious torment, whether or not that is justified,
          is clearly the metaphorical interpretation of these passages.

            Peterson and Other Traditionalist Scholarship</a
          >, JETS 50/2 (June 2007), 329-47: "Annihilationists have noted that
          instead of speaking in terms of everlasting suffering, the Bible
          predominantly describes the fate of the lost in terms of
          destruction... John Stott has commented that 'it would seem strange,
          therefore, if people who are said to suffer destruction are in fact
          not destroyed.' He concurs with his partner in dialogue David Edwards
          (while they disagree on many other things) that it is 'difficult to
          imagine a perpetually inconclusive process of perishing.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
          created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
          existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live
          on forever. God "is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna."
          (Mat. 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone
          will experience eternal life, either in heaven or hell, is an
          assumption that must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is
          almost the only text used to argue that all people will be raised with
          immortality and incorruptibility; however, in context, this chapter is
          only about those in Christ being raised and says nothing of
          unbelievers. Verses like John 3:16 indicate the opposite, that
          unbelievers are destined to perish.

          salvation is understood to be rescue from the mortal condition that
          results from sin... It explains why Christ’s resurrection is so unique
          and profound, and how if we are to receive eternal life and
          immortality, it is necessary for us to participate in 'a resurrection
          like his' (Rom 6:5). To a dying world, the fact that Jesus died and
          conquered death for us is very good news indeed."

          a variety of non-Christian religions often dismiss the doctrine of
          eternal torment as absurd... Meanwhile, Scripture and human experience
          testify to the reality that people deeply fear death, and the Bible’s
          offer of immortal life is naturally appealing to them... Consequently,
          evangelism done from a conditionalist perspective will fare just as
          successfully as evangelism based on escaping eternal torment,
          <em>if not more so</em>."

          heart tell me, but what does God’s Word say?'... In face of that
          stumbling block to the evangelistic work of traditionalists in the
          western world, might it not be, therefore, that an annihilationist
          understanding would be considerably less scandalous, and therefore
          that Christian annihilationists would find themselves more eager to
          share the good news of Jesus’ saving work, and less reluctant to
          describe the consequences of rejecting Christ?"

        <h1>The Law</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 2:17</h2>
        <p>
          "but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;
          for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die."
        </p>
        <p>
          God warned Adam that he would surely die if he ate from the tree of
          the knowledge of good and evil. Natural, literal death is clearly
          intended here. Hence, in Genesis 3:19, God says, "you are dust, and
          you shall return to dust." Therefore, God kicked Adam out of the
          garden, "lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of
          life, and eat, and live forever" (Gen 3:22). Paul explains that "as
          sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so
          death passed to all men because all sinned." (Rom 5:12). Without the
          tree of life, all are destined to perish and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Revelation, it is revealed that believers will get to partake of
          the tree of life and live forevermore: "On this side of the river and
          on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding
          its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of
          the nations." (Rev 22:2). Paul explains that believers will be made
          unable to die: "The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The
          second man is the Lord from heaven... Now I say this, brothers, that
          flesh and blood can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the
          perishable inherit imperishable... For this perishable body must
          become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality." (1 Cor
          15:47, 50, 53).
        </p>
        <p>
          It follows that some will not inherit the imperishable or receive
          immortality. They will be subject to eternal death and won't obtain to
          the final age: "But those who are considered worthy to attain to that
          age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in
          marriage. For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels
          and are children of God, being children of the resurrection." (Lk
          20:35-36).

        <h2>Psalm 73:17-20</h2>
        <p>
          "I entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end. You throw
          them down to destruction. How they are suddenly destroyed! They are
          completely swept away with terrors. As a dream when one wakes up, so,
          Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 92:7 // 58:8 // 145:20</h2>
        <p>
          "though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers

          teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish."
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase gnashing of teeth indicates anger, annoyance, and being
          upset at the inability to stop something. Here it is used in
          conjunction with the wicked melting away and perishing. It does not
          suggest a perpetual process of suffering. Neither is gnashing of teeth
          ever said to last forever in the New Testament.

          to the upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
          The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in

          This verse does not teach the immortality of the soul. The Hebrew word
          "olam" is commonly translated as "darkness," "eternity," or "the
          future." This verse is about the insatiable longing for and awareness
          of something beyond this world that God has instilled in human hearts.
          Humans possess an inherent sense of something beyond the temporal
          world. Yet we are unable to fully understand God's workings or be
          ultimately satisfied in this world. This verse describes that
          existential reality.

        <h1>The Prophets</h1>
        <h2>Isaiah 33:11-12, 14</h2>
        <p>
          "You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your breath
          is a fire that will devour you. The peoples will be like the burning
          of lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire... The
          sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who
          among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with
          everlasting burning?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah provides the background for many of the New Testament’s
          teachings about hell. Chaff being burned represents complete devouring
          and destruction (Mat 3:12). Trees (Mat 7:19), weeds (Mat 13:40), and
          thorns and thistles (Heb 6:8) likewise are cut down and burned up. The
          obvious answer to Isaiah's rhetorical question, who among us can live,
          is that they will not be able to continue living in the midst of
          everlasting, devouring fire (Mat 18:8). The fire does not turn them
          into a juggernaut that can take on endless fire. While it may be
          possible to withstand fire for 5 or 10 minutes, this imagery conveys
          an utterly destructive power that will obliterate the wicked.
        </p>

        <h2>Isaiah 66:16</h2>
        <p>
          "For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all
          flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus is the one who will execute judgment by a "flaming fire" (2 Thes
          1:7). The sword of judgment will fall on the on the lawless one, "whom
          the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the
          manifestation of his coming" (2 Thes 2:8). Thus, many will be slain
          and face the penalty of "eternal destruction from the face of the Lord
          and from the glory of his might" (2 Thes 1:8).
        </p>

        <h2>Isaiah 66:24</h2>
        <p>
          "They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have
          transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their
          fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus uses this imagery of the worm not dying and the fire not being
          quenched in conjunction with Gehenna, a valley of dead bodies that
          serves as a picture of the final end for unbelievers. Notice that the
          context in both is about dead bodies. The worms will devour. The fire
          will not be put out until it completely consumes. The unrighteous will
          forever be remembered with contempt. Though "unquenchable fire"
          strikes modern readers to mean eternal torment, the Old Testament
          background demonstrates that it refers to a consuming fire that can't
          be extinguished.
        </p>

        <h2>Jeremiah 7:32-33 // 19:6-13</h2>
        <p>
          "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more
          be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The
          valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no
          place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the
          birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will
          frighten them away.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the background for Jesus' teaching about Gehenna (what is
          commonly translated hell, the final end for the unsaved). Gehenna will

          death, destruction, and annihilation, the exact opposite of eternal
          torment.

          will burn them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them
          neither root nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of
          righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and
          leap like calves of the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for
          they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I
          make,' says Yahweh of Armies."
        </p>
        <p>
          God's destruction of the wicked will be complete. There will be no
          part left untouched by the burning furnace and no part left
          unconsumed. They will be like "natural animals to be taken and
          destroyed" and "will in their destroying surely be destroyed" (2 Pet
          2:12). Only the righteous will arise to healing and life. All those
          who work wickedness will rise to judgment and be burned up with
          unquenchable fire so that only ashes remain.

          – always refers to the literal killing of a person... Some claims in
          biblical interpretation are matters of opinion and open to question,
          but this is not one of them... However theologically inconvenient it
          may be for defenders of the traditional doctrine of the eternal
          torments of hell, this is an instance where the exegetical evidence is

          Notice that it is a day of judgment that is said to be worse. It does
          not say that they will experience an everlasting time of greater
          misery. Whatever way degrees of punishment are worked out for each
          person, whether the amount of time or suffering, God's justice demands
          that the ultimate end of the unsaved is death, deprivation of
          psychosomatic life. Another factor may be the way they are remembered.
          The wicked in general will be remembered with "everlasting contempt"
          (Dan 12:2) and "disgust" (Isa 66:24), but mass murders will be
          remembered with greater disdain than liars.

          in interpreting it. This is not just generically speaking of
          destroying. Whereas John 10:10 just broadly says the enemy seeks to
          'destroy,' Jesus’s words in Matthew get much more specific. Jesus is
          speaking of hell (Greek <em>gehenna</em>), the place of final
          punishment."

        <h2>Matthew 18:8 // 25:41 // Mark 9:47 // Jude 7</h2>

          it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or
          crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the
          eternal fire."

        <p>
          The very next verse says, "If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it
          out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with
          one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of
          fire" (Mat 18:9). The parallel of "eternal fire" with "Gehenna of
          fire" indicates that they are referring to the same fate. The Gehenna
          of fire is where God's enemies go to die. Gehenna is The Valley of
          Slaughter. It's a picture of God's enemies being slain, and the dead
          bodies are utterly consumed by scavengers and fire. Jeremiah 19:6-11
          says:
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
            Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place

            Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’... I will cause them to fall
            by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek
            their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds
            of the sky and for the animals of the earth... Even so I will break
            this people and this city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that
            can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth until there is

          Jude tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah "are shown as an example,
          suffering the punishment of eternal fire" (Jude 1:7). Eternal fire
          emphasizes that the result of the fire is eternal, not that the fire
          itself is perpetually burning. The complete destruction of Sodom and
          Gomorrah functions typologically to show the outcome of the
          unrighteous, complete annihilation, and again demonstrates what
          eternal fire means. It indicates total devestation from Lord,
          consistent with Jesus' teaching about Gehenna, where soul and body are
          destroyed, inextinguishable fire consumes fully, and worms devour.

          does not mean he goes on saving forever, but that the salvation he
          offers is eternal... The same is true for 'eternal redemption,' Christ
          does not go on forever redeeming, but the result of his once for all
          act of redemption is eternal (Heb 9:12). When it comes to 'eternal
          punishment' (Matt 25:46) and 'eternal destruction' (2 Thess 1:9),
          where 'eternal' modifies an action, it seems plausible to suggest that
          the punishing and destruction do not go on forever, but that there is
          an act of punishment/destruction which leads to an eternal result."

          >, 2014: "In a nutshell, when other nouns of action are qualified as
          eternal, it is often the results of the act, and not the act itself,
          that lasts for eternity... Few traditionalists, if any, argue that
          this verse [Hebrews 6:2, '...eternal judgment'] teaches that God is
          continually judging for eternity, banging his gavel and repeatedly
          declaring saved or unsaved the same finite number of existent people."

        <h2>Mark 9:47-48 // Matthew 5:22 // Isaiah 66:24</h2>
        <p>
          "...cast into the Gehenna of fire, 'where their worm doesn’t die, and
          the fire is not quenched.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna, shorthand for "The valley of Hinnom," is a place filled with
          unburied corpses that are eaten by scavengers and burned by fire:
        </p>
        <section>
          “Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more
          be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The
          valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no
          place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the
          birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will
          frighten them away. Then I will cause to cease from the cities of
          Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the
          voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
          bride; for the land will become a waste.” (Jeremiah 7:32-42).
        </section>

        <p>
          Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 where it clearly states that corpses are
          being consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of
          the worm and fire in Isaiah is not about eternal conscious torment but
          emphasizes the shame and complete destruction of the wicked:
        </p>
        <section>
          “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
          remain before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall
          remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from
          one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,”
          says Yahweh. “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men
          who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor
          will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all
          mankind.” (Isaiah 66:22-24).
        </section>
        <p>
          The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never
          die" in other biblical contexts (e.g., Genesis 42:20, Exodus 30:20,
          Jeremiah 38:24). It often means "will not die at a particular time or
          in a particular context." In Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms
          will not die before completely devouring the corpses. That is
          especially true when it is connected to Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that
          burns forever. "Quench" primarily means "extinguish." The fire in
          Isaiah cannot be extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This
          imagery emphasizes the complete and irreversible nature of the
          consumption.

          >, 2018. Dear provides two arguments against the traditional
          interpretation: "1. The Old Testament background of the passage paints
          a very different picture from the idea of conscious, resurrected
          people alive in a place of fire and biting worms (or their symbolic
          equivalent) forever. 2. The terms used about worms not dying and fire
          not being quenched don’t even mean eternal duration in the first
          place. That part is read into the passage by people who already
          believe that hell is a place of eternal torment."

          Believers and non-believers will be resurrected on the day of the
          Lord, but there will be a resurrection of the saved and a resurrection
          of the unsaved. This dual nature of the resurrection reflects the dual
          nature of the outcomes. Evil-doers will face "the resurrection of
          judgment" while the righteous will come out "to the resurrection of
          life" (Jn 5:29). The unrighteous will awake to "shame" while the
          righteous will rise to "everlasting life" (Dan 12:2). The consistent
          contrast of judgment with life reflects the fact that it will not
          include life. "Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to
          destroy" (Jam 4:12).

          sin for eternity. In the conditionalist view, sinners and all of their

          Commentary (Nashville: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 2003), 453: "This
          fire functions as an example because it is a type or anticipation of
          what is to come for all those who reject God. The destruction of Sodom
          and Gomorrah is not merely a historical curiosity; it functions
          typologically as a prophecy of what is in store for the rebellious.
          The narrative stresses the devastation of the Lord raining fire and
          brimstone upon the cities (Gen 19:24–28)."

          Under the generic terms of Hades and Sheol are more specific
          descriptions and names of the intermediate state. Paradise and
          Abraham's Bosom are the abodes of the righteous. The outer, black
          darkness, the pit, the abyss, and Tartarus are all names of the place
          where those people or angels go while waiting for the final judgment
          who rebelled against God. It characterized by weeping and gnashing of
          teeth. That may be what this is what this verse is referring to.
        </p>

          The darkness may instead be refereeing to the nothingness which awaits
          the wicked after annihilation. This language of darkness doesn't have
          to refer to some conscious existence. Jude and Peter make it clear
          that destruction is the end for the unrighteous. Job uses this same
          kind of langauge of darkness when he wished he never existed:

          <p>
            “Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said,
            ‘There is a boy conceived.’ Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God
            from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it. Let
            darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud
            dwell on it. Let all that makes the day black terrify it. As for
            that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among
            the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.
            Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.
            Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up
            leviathan. Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for
            light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
            because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it
            hide trouble from my eyes.”

          Many modern traditionalists argue that the fires of hell must be
          figurative because hell is described in contradictory ways as a place
          of darkness and a place of fire; however, looking at these passages in
          more detail reveals that these descriptions are of two different
          places or experiences. The unrighteous will be held in the outer
          darkness until the great judgment, at which time they will be thrown
          into Gehenna, the lake of fire, where they will utterly perish. The
          diametrically opposed imagery is an obvious sign that these are not
          referring to the thing.

          reserved forever' for these false teachers, that this suggests Hell is
          to be understood as an eternity spent separated from God in some
          metaphorical darkness (because fire produces light and so the fires
          and darkness of Hell cannot be taken literally). But this text follows
          shortly after verse 7 in which Jude says Sodom and Gomorrah suffered
          the punishment of eternal fire as an example of what awaits these
          false teachers. It comes after verse 10, too, which indicates along
          with its parallel in 2 Peter 2:12 that false teachers will be
          destroyed like animals are destroyed."

        <h1>Revelation</h1>
        <h2>Revelation 11:18</h2>
        <p>
          "The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the
          dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their
          reward, as well as to the saints and those who fear your name, to the
          small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
        </p>

        <h2>Revelation 14:9-11</h2>
        <p>
          "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
          anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
          forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath
          of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
          tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and
          in the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up
          forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship
          the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, the cup of God's wrath is a potent symbol of
          divine judgment, sometimes temporary and recoverable, while at other
          times irreversible and destructive (Isa 51:22-52:2; Obad 16; Jer
          25:27). Jesus, representing humanity, took upon himself the wrathful
          cup, enduring death (Matt 26:39, 42, 44). His death and resurrection
          mean that his followers no longer face this wrath, instead receiving a
          cup of blessing (Matt 26:27-29). Revelation portrays the cup as a
          judgment against "Babylon," the epitome of evil, leading to its
          inevitable destruction (Rev 16:19; 18:6, 7-9). It affects all those
          allied with the beast (Rev 17–19), and symbolizes a final, fatal
          judgment, leading to utter destruction characterized by torture,
          grief, famine, and fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Genesis 19:23, 28; Deuteronomy 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isaiah
          30:27-33; 34:9-11; Ezekiel 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive
          annihilation and complete destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in
          its wake. This picture appears to be in stark contrast to
          excruciating, unending suffering.

          "He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
          plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a
          furnace" (Genesis 19:28).
        </section>
        <p>
          Smoke rising forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the
          wicked. This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was
          destroyed by fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the
          everlasting nature of its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as
          a permanent reminder of God's final victory over evil.

          "It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From
          generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through
          it forever and ever" (Isaiah 34:10).
        </section>
        <p>
          John vividly depicts the plight of those who worship the beast,
          emphasizing that they find no respite "day or night." John
          consistently uses "day and night" in Revelation to describe continuous
          actions, unrelated to time of day, such as the living creatures'
          praise, the martyrs' service, Satan's accusations, and the torment of
          the unholy trinity. Similarly, Isaiah 34:10 uses "night and day" to
          describe Edom's unquenched fire, symbolizing complete destruction.
          While the fire burns continuously without ceasing, it will eventually
          consume completely.

          night' (ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός) in 14:11 can be taken as a qualitative
          genitive construction indicating not duration of time (like the
          accusative construction of the same phrase) but kind of time, that is,
          time of ceaseless activity... The lack of rest will continue
          uninterrupted as long as the period of suffering lasts, though there
          will be an end to the period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11
          could indicate a great judgment that will be remembered forever, not
          one that leads to eternal suffering."

          Judgement is pictured repeatedly in the language of final, decisive
          destruction, not ongoing torment... If the picture in Revelation 18

          is destroyed... To the gruesome images of Ezekiel, John adds 'devour
          her flesh,' a reference to the total annihilation of the
          harlot-city... All three elements—betrayal, plagues, parousia—are part
          of the same sovereign plan of God by which he will bring world history

          John interprets the "lake of fire" as the "the second death" (Rev
          20:14; 21:8). John is not using symbolism to interpret his symbolism.
          The vision he sees represents death, not torment. This vision is a
          climatic recapitulation of judgment portrayed throughout Revelation
          (16:14, 16; 17:14; 19:11-21). Christ's enemies are destroyed. Death
          and the grave are no more. The first things have passed away, and
          righteousness will be forever more.

          is used to denote utter destruction, not an ongoing process. (c) The
          inanimate entities thrown into the lake of fire are later taken to be
          destroyed, and so (d) it is reasonable to assume the same end for the

          The wicked city Babylon is pictured as a woman whose judgment in
          chapter 18 is 'torment and grief,' which turns out to be 'death,
          mourning, and famine,' and she is 'consumed by fire.' It is not

          whole Apocalypse must determine whether this is a limited time or an
          unending period... All unbelievers suffering the first death are held
          in the sphere of 'death and Hades,' which is a temporary,
          preconsummate holding tank to be finally replaced by the permanent,
          consummate 'lake of fire,' which is 'the second death' (see on

          Publishing, 2000), pg. 179: "However, in view of the structure of the
          whole book, it makes more sense to see 20:1–15 as the seventh and last
          cycle of judgments, each of which leads up to the Second Coming... The
          final battle in 20:7–10 seems to be the same as the final battle in
          16:14, 16; 17:14; 19:11–21... Most importantly, all of Christ’s
          enemies are destroyed in 19:11–21. If 20:1–6 describes events later
          than 19:11–21, there would be no one left for Satan to deceive in
          20:3."

          strange definition of death and apply it to other verses like Romans
          6:23... They say that 'death' does not mean what we normally think of
          as 'death'. Indeed, the traditional view is that the unsaved NEVER
          actually die. Instead they live forever in the lake of fire. Hopefully

            >A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith: 2nd Edition</a
          >, 2020. In response to the chapter called "Eternal Punishment
          Construed as Annihilation," pgs. 1068-1081:
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond says in the beginning of this section that John gives us a
          "graphic representation of hell," but just after that, he quotes
          Revelation 14:9-11 and states that "<em>eternal conscious torment</em>
          is [here] said to be the punishment of those who have the mark of the
          beast." These two statements contradict. John is not giving
          straightforward, didactic teaching about hell. He's recording a
          pictorial representation of hell that he sees in a vision, not a
          vision of hell itself. The Old Testament background, parallel judgment
          passages, and John's own interpretation of the symbols are the keys to
          understanding what that imagery represents. Reymond completely
          disregards the context and takes his own interpretation for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we take the passage at face value without interpreting what
          each symbol represents, Reymond's interpretation of eternal conscious
          torment still does not follow. John only states that these people will
          be tormented in fire, won't have any rest for a time, and the smoke
          rising from this judgment will last forever. Traditionalist scholar G.
          K. Beale, quoted above, agrees that an annihilationist reading is
          possible because "Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great judgment that
          will be remembered forever, not one that leads to eternal suffering."
          Furthermore, there are conditionalists that do believe that eternal
          conscious torment is being depicted here that symbolizes annihilation.
          Either way, Reymond has decided that eternal conscious torment is the
          correct view ahead of time and skips the necessary exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demonstrates a common interpretive problem when it comes to this
          issue. Revelation may be the hardest book to interpret in the New
          Testament. It is full of symbolism and Old Testament allusions which
          are not readily understood by people in a context removed from the
          original audience. Sometimes there is no way to understand the symbols
          at all without being given an interpretation. Thus, taking a surface
          level reading of Revelation 14:9-11 or 20:10, concluding that it
          teaches eternal conscious torment, and then reading that view back
          into every other passage about hell is completely backwards and
          irresponsible hermeneutically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that short argument from Revelation, Reymond finishes his very
          first paragraph by concluding that "it is clear that the divine
          judgment awaiting evil-doers is certain, just, and eternal." Every
          conditionalist would agree wholeheartedly with this conclusion, except
          that Reymond clearly means eternal torment is certain. Not only is
          this misrepresenting conditionalism as if it denies eternal punishment
          before even explaining the position, but it's also presenting that
          poor exegesis of Revelation as if it's decisive. Reymond has already
          precluded the possibility of conditionalism with absolutely no
          biblical support offered. The eisegesis that follows was inevitable
          from his starting position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond addresses very few Old Testament passages because of his
          presupposition of eternal conscious torment. The Old Testament has
          much to say about the final death and destruction of the wicked, and
          God putting a final end to evil. However, the few texts cited still
          provide a vivid picture of annihilation: the fiery destruction of
          Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of Sihon killing every man, woman,
          and child, the principle of herem ("devotion") to the Lord for
          complete destruction, the fact that every evil deed will be judged,
          and the prophecy that the redeemed will go out in the new heavens and
          new earth to look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against God
          which are being eaten by worms and burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          That last image comes from Isaiah 66:22-24. The only comment on this
          passage is a quote from a commentary. It affirms that this passage is
          indeed about the final state but explains away the obvious
          conditionalist implications by calling it a "monstrous and
          inconceivable" picture. Actually, it's very clear. The picture is of
          dead bodies that were slain, burned up, consumed, and looked on with
          contempt. It then cites Mark 9:48 as support that this is a picture of
          eternal torment, but that is a completely circular argument. Jesus
          quotes from this passage in Mark 9:48, not to make it mean the exact
          opposite of what it means in context, but because the wicked being
          slain, devoured by an unextinguishable fire, and consumed is an
          accurate picture of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament section is hurt by the bad exegesis of the Old
          Testament and many of the objections are already answered above. Jesus
          uses the phrase "unquenchable fire" because the fire can't be put out,
          so that it completely consumes. Reymond acknowledges that the garbage
          dump theory of Gehenna comes "from late Jewish tradition (David
          Qimchi, c. A. D. 1200)" and has no support, but he nevertheless
          wrongly treats that as the primary background over and against the Old
          Testament. The Old Testament background of dead bodies being consumed
          by fire and eaten by maggots is diametrically opposed to the garbage
          dump myth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weeping primarily indicates sadness. Gnashing teeth primarily
          indicates anger. Weeping and gnashing are not said to last eternally,
          and are accurate descriptions of people on death row or being burned
          alive. He says that a "more bearable" (Mat 10:15) judgment day on an
          annihilationist view is difficult to comprehend because everyone ends
          up dead. Being killed by hanging versus being burned alive clearly
          represent two different degrees of capital punishment. On the
          contrary, it is very hard to comprehend how the traditional view
          accounts for different degrees of punishment when one sin merits the
          same punishment as a billion sins, eternal suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the intermediate state consists of torment, it does not follow
          that the eternal state consists of eternal torment. Just because the
          demons expect torment in the future (Mat 8:29), doesn't mean that they
          expect everlasting torment (And so what if they did?). Tartarus does
          not refer to the place of eternal punishment. That is just a factual
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for some reason, even though Reymond and Vos think the language of
          2 Thessalonians 1:9 is of annihilation, Vos thinks "that
          'annihilation' is an extremely abstract idea, too philosophical, in
          fact." It's not that complicated. It just means death. He also argues
          that Paul couldn't have been thinking of annihilation because Jesus
          taught eternal torment in the gospels. This again shows the potential
          danger of arguing based on analogy of scripture when you don't want to
          accept what a verse teaches. It's better to carefully exegete the text
          before attempting to apply systematic theology to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire chapter illustrates how a bad starting place,
          misinterpreting a passage in Revelation, led to the entire Old and New
          Testaments being read incorrectly. It also illustrates that we can't
          be dogmatic about tradition. We must test all things by the Word of
          God. Reymond concludes the New Testament section without an in depth
          treatment of Revelation, but he assures us of his interpretation about
          the fires of Revelation by stating that "we should understand the
          realities these biblical passages seek to represent to be
          <em>more</em>—not less—horrible than their word depictions." However,
          having a more intolerable, dreadful, and harsh view of hell does not
          make it correct or more convincing.

          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2013). In response to the chapter
          called "Eternal Punishment of Unbelievers (Hell)," pgs. 1081-1083:
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Frame admits that he is reluctant to write about the topic of
          hell, unpleasant as it is, he states, "I must teach only what the
          Bible teaches." This is certainly to be commended; however, the
          question still remains, what does the Bible teach about hell?
        </p>
        <p>
          I certainly agree with Frame that all sinners are under the just
          condemnation of a holy God and in need of a savior. We are saved by
          faith in the Son of God who died on the cross for us. His death
          provides atonement for our sins, but the wrath of God remains of those
          who don't believe in the Son. Frame cites Exodus 15:6-7 to explain the
          wrath of God, but it also provides important background information
          about the consuming fire of God:
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
            Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand,
            Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces. In the greatness of your
            excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send
            out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          Frame states that the "OT descriptions of God's wrath mainly concern
          what happens in this life." The Old Testament speaks of God's enemies
          being slain, consumed by fire, and put to an end. He is beginning to
          try to create a contrast between Old and New Testament language of
          destruction because he believes that the New Testament teaches eternal
          conscious torment. A problem with this approach is that the New
          Testament uses Old Testament language to talk about eschatological
          judgment. If the Old Testament uses annihilation language, it provides
          strong support for conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then makes the philosophical argument that punishment in this life
          could never satisfy God's law and cites Hebrews 10:26-27:
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
            For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
            truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain
            fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will
            devour the adversaries.
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          This sounds awfully familiar to the outcome of God's enemies in the
          Old Testament. Eternal conscious torment doesn't teach that God's
          enemies will be devoured. Instead, it teaches that they will continue
          burning forever without ever being devoured completely. Thus far, no
          support for the traditional doctrine can be found while much of the
          language cited provides support for conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists agree with Frame that the final "punishment is
          everlasting," but Romans 6:23 explains what the punishment for sin is:
          "the wages of sin is death." Frame cites Matthew 25:46 to support the
          eternal aspect of the final judgment:
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
            These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
            eternal life.
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          Notice that Jesus contrasts eternal punishment with eternal life.
          Whatever the final punishment is, it can't include eternal life.
          However, that is the very thing that traditionalists argue for. They
          argue that the punishment will be an embodied life of suffering in
          hell forever where they are made immortal and never die.
          Conditionalists, on the other hand, argue that the punishment must not
          include eternal life, which must mean death, the very thing that the
          New Testament says is the punishment for sin many times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Frame reveals the real impetus behind his belief in eternal
          conscious torment: Revelation 14:11 yet again! And continuing the
          pattern, there is no consideration given to the context, genre, or
          background of the verse. It's just cited as if it came out of a
          textbook, rather than an apocalyptic book full of Old Testament
          allusions and bizarre symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frame's only response to annihilationism is that "Scripture suggests
          the opposite, that not only does the fire continue forever, but the
          torment of the wicked continues forever as well (Rev. 14:11; 20:10)."
          Again, no explanation is given. If you remember that John's vision is
          of a representation of hell (it's symbolic), then you realize that
          Frame hasn't even started to give a biblical argument for eternal
          conscious because he hasn't even tried to interpret any of the
          symbols. Both passages are describing the lake of fire. John
          interprets the lake of fire for us in clear language two times. The
          lake of fire is the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          He provides several references in parentheses for support which, when
          understood in context, provide vivid pictures of annihilation. Mark
          9:43 and 48 contain a quote to Isaiah 66:24, a passage indicating that
          the fires will be inextinguishable, thus burning up the dead bodies
          completely. Luke 16:22-24 and 28 are about Hades, the intermediate
          state, further demonstrating the continual sloppiness of exegesis in
          support of the traditional view. Revelation 19:3 indicates that smoke
          rises forever. Likewise, the smoke rises forever from Edom which was
          destroyed by unquenchable fire (Isa 34:8-10). The smoke symbolizes the
          remembrance of its complete destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other verses in Scripture are very clear on this issue too. Paul
          speaks much of the destruction of the wicked. The language of
          perishing and dying is used all over the New Testament. The Old
          Testament is very clear about the fate of the wicked too. All of that
          clear teaching can't be reinterpreted based upon the non-exegesis of
          Revelation. Unfortunately, that's what most defenses of the
          traditional view amount to.
