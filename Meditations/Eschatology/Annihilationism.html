        <h2>Conditionalism</h2>
        <p>
          Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
          resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a
          second, irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. Only
          those who are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of
          immortality and eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional belief in eternal conscious torment of the unsaved,
          whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects our
          interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about "death"
          and "destruction" to be interpreted metaphorically to refer to
          seperation from God, pain, or torment even though annihilation,
          extinction, or cessation of consciousness would appear to be the
          obvious interpretation of these passages otherwise. The doctrine of
          eternal torment rests on three core texts: Mark 9:47-48, Revelation
          14:10-11, and Revelation 20:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Annihilationism is true, each core text used to support eternal
          torment should have a plausible interpretation that is compatible with
          Conditionalism. Other texts used to support eternal torment are less
          compelling and can readily be interpreted in a harmonious way with
          Conditionalism. Until these texts are proven to not teach eternal
          conscious torment, that view is bound to be read into every passage.
          If it is shown not to be taught in Scripture, annihilationism follows
          naturally and a focus on positive arguments for the position can be
          examined.
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. It is both authoritative and
          accurate. It is the standard of truth over and against all human
          traditions, philosophies, creeds, councils, and authorities. It is my
          goal to understand the biblical texts about hell in context and to
          leave behind presuppositions or philosophical arguments that don't
          come from the Bible. I don't have a set position for or against
          Annihilationism, I'm still studying the issue, but I do see it as a
          plausible view worth considering seriously after re-examining some of
          the biblical texts which appeared to me to teach the traditional view
          until I examined them critically. I will present positive arguments
          for Annihilationism first and then challenge or defend them as I study
          and revise the article.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain?
          One only needs to consider the time before the Reformation where the
          majority of the visible church was certain that justification was by
          faith and works. It was going back to the Word of God afresh that
          revealed that doctrinal error. So it is certainly possible for many to
          be mistaken about what the Bible teaches, but what in Scripture would
          cause someone to question eternal torment? Well, just laying out
          common biblical language about the final judgment of the wicked sounds
          like Annihilationism:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible clearly states that the righteous will be resurrected and
          given immortality and incorruptibility. In contrast, there is no
          suggestion in the Scriptures that the wicked will be granted either
          immortality or incorruptibility. They will not recieve eternal life
          but perish. They will be excluded from God's presence and cast into
          the lake of fire, where they will undergo the second death.
        </p>
        <p>
          This eternal punishment, the second death, represents the ultimate
          consequence of sin. It entails eternal and complete destruction,
          enacted by God who has the power to annihilate both soul and body in
          hell. This form of punishment means absolute and irreversible
          perishing, in stark contrast to eternal life, which is consistently
          presented in the New Testament as the desirable alternative to death,
          destruction, and perishing.
        </p>

        <h2>Fallacies</h2>
        <p>
          Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman to be
          knocked down with a verse like Matthew 25:46. Both sides affirm
          eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature of that
          punishment. The destruction or annihilation of a person would be an
          irreversible and eternal punishment that forever seperated that person
          from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea
          of people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just
          theological liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people
          begin with these kinds of accusations. The goal is not to
          psychoanalyze the other side but to examine arguments about the
          biblical view of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as
          metaphors for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets
          these descriptions non-literally or metaphocially is not only false,
          it is used rhetorically to discount consideration of the view.
          Destruction and annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on
          fire are consumed and destroyed (to be more biblically precise,
          believers are not consumed in fire but non-believers are). Rather,
          construing these descriptions to mean eternal conscious torment,
          whether or not that is justified, is clearly the metaphorical
          interpretation of these passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
          character of love and justice: This is a red herring. It may or may
          not be more consistent with God's love and justice; however, the focus
          should remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room
          to discuss the justness of it, but this should not be treated as the
          primary argument or motivation behind this view.
        </p>

        <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
          created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
          existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live
          on forever. God "can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Mat. 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone
          will go to either heaven or hell for eternity is an assumption that
          must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is sometimes used to
          argue that all people will be raised with immortality and
          incorruptibility, and it is almost the only text used to argue this
          position. However, in context, this chapter is about those who are in
          Christ being raised and says nothing of unbelievers. Verses like John
          3:16 indicate the opposite, that they are destined to perish.

        <h1>Core Texts</h1>
        <h2>Mark 9:47-48</h2>
        <p>
          "...cast into the Gehenna of fire, 'where their worm doesn’t die, and
          the fire is not quenched.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna became notorious during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh,
          who committed abominable acts there, including the sacrifice of their
          own children by fire to the god Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6). The
          valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be called a
          place of slaughter, where it was prophesied to be filled with the
          corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became
          synonymous with extreme divine punishment, where the bodies of the
          slain were left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting
          a vivid picture of desolation and wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just a physical location,
          but the culmination of divine judgment, where the opportunity for
          salvation is irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete
          destruction by God. Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically by using
          strong language about the body and its parts to illustrate the
          seriousness of avoiding sin and its consequences (Matthew 5:22, 29-30,
          18:9). This imagery resonates with the imagery in Isaiah 66:24,
          reinforcing the notion of Gehenna as a place of total annihilation for
          the wicked. This is consistent with Paul who speaks of the ultimate
          fate of the wicked in terms of destruction (Philippians 1:28; 3:18-19;
          Romans 9:22-24; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24, where it clearly states that corpses are
          being consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of
          the worm and fire is not about eternal conscious torment but
          emphasizes the everlasting shame and complete destruction of the
          wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never
          die" in other biblical contexts (e.g., Genesis 42:20, Exodus 30:20,
          Jeremiah 38:24). It often means "will not die at a particular time or
          in a particular context." In Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms
          will not die before completely devouring the corpses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that
          burns forever. "Quench" primarily means "extinguish." The fire in
          Isaiah cannot be extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This
          imagery emphasizes the complete and irreversible nature of the
          consumption.

        <h2>Revelation 14:10-11</h2>
        <p>
          "...he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
          prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with
          fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence
          of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They
          have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image,
          and whoever receives the mark of his name."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that the book of Revelation is filled with
          symbolic language and apocalyptic imagery. Much like interpreting a
          parable, the goal is not to analyze the pictoral elements literally
          but to look at what meaning the picture is trying to convey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The torment the wicked experience is not an endless agony, but rather
          an extreme encounter with God's justice at the final judgment. It is
          so terrifying that they are unable to rest day or night while awaiting
          that time. The finality and decisiveness of God's judgement is
          conveyed through fire and brimstone language. Similar to the fall of
          Babylon depicted in Revelation 18, their torment and destruction are a
          closed chapter in history, forever marked by the enduring symbol of
          rising smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Genesis 19:23, 28, Deuteronomy 29:23, Job 18:15-17, Isaiah
          30:27-33; 34:9-11, and Ezekiel 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive
          annihilation and complete destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in
          its wake. This picture appears to be in stark contrast to
          excruciating, unending suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall how Abraham saw smoke rising from Sodom and Gomorrah,
          signifying their final annihilation (Genesis 19:28). Smoke rising
          forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the wicked. This is
          the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was destroyed by
          fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the everlasting nature
          of its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as a permanent
          reminder of God's final victory over evil.
