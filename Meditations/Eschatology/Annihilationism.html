        <h2>Conditionalism</h2>
        <p>
          Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
          resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a
          second, irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. Only
          those who are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of
          immortality and eternal life. One's view of the intermediate state is
          irrelevant to this issue because it is purely a view about the eternal
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional belief in eternal torment, whether right or wrong,
          acts as a doctrinal grid that affects our interpretation of biblical
          texts. This grid forces texts about "death" and "destruction" to be
          interpreted metaphorically even though Conditionalism would be the
          obvious interpretation of these passages otherwise. The doctrine of
          eternal torment rests on four core texts: Matthew 18:34-35, Mark
          9:43-48, Revelation 14:11, and Revelation 20:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Annihilationism is true, each core text used to support eternal
          torment should have a plausible interpretation that is compatible with
          Conditionalism. Other texts used to support eternal torment are less
          compelling and can be interpreted in a harmonious way with
          Conditionalism. Until these texts are proven to not teach eternal
          concious torment, that view is bound to be read into every passage. If
          it is shown not to be taught in Scripture, annihilationism follows
          naturally and a focus on positive arguments for the position can be
          examined.
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. It is both authoritative and
          accurate. It is the standard of truth over and against all human
          traditions and authorities. It is my goal to understand the biblical
          texts about hell in context and to leave behind presuppositions or
          philosophical arguments that don't come from the text. I don't have a
          set position for or against Annihilationism, I'm still studying the
          issue, but I do see it as a plausible view worth considering seriously
          after re-examining some of the biblical texts, texts which did appear
          to me to teach the traditional view but in fact do not.
        </p>

        <h2>Caricatures</h2>
        <p>
          Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman to be
          knocked down with a verse like Matthew 25:46. Both sides affirm
          eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature of that
          punishment. Destruction or annihilation of a person would be an
          irreversible and eternal punishment that forever seperated that person
          from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea
          of people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just
          theological liberals that won't follow the plain meaning of the text:
          This is just poisoning the well when people throw out these kinds of
          accusations. The goal is not to psychoanalyze the other side but to
          examine arguments about the biblical view of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as
          metaphors for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets
          these descriptions non-literally or metaphocially is not only false,
          it is used rhetorically to discount consideration of the view.
          Destruction and annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on
          fire are consumed and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions
          of hell to mean eternal concious tourment is clearly the metaphorical
          interpretation of these passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
          character of love and justice: This is a red herring. It may or may
          not be more consistent with God's love and justice; however, the focus
          should remain exegetical first and foremost.
        </p>

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
          created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
          existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live
          on forever. God "can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Mat. 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          That everyone will spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone
          will go to either heaven or hell for eternity is an assumption that
          must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is sometimes applied to
          all people being raised with immortality and incorruptibility, and it
          is almost the only text used to argue this position. In context, this
          chapter is about those who are in Christ being raised and says nothing
          of unbelievers. Annihilationists reject the traditional
          interpretations of the core eternal torment texts. This would leave no
          support for the belief that the unsaved continue existence after the
          final judgement.
