        <h2>Present Millenialism</h2>
        <p>
          Amillennialism holds that the millennium mentioned in Revelation
          20:1-6 is a symbolic era between Christ's first and second coming. It
          represents the entirety of the Church Age. Christ is currently
          reigning from heaven, seated at the right hand of God. This spiritual
          reign is manifested in the church. The binding of Satan, mentioned in
          Revelation 20, occurred at Christ's first coming to limit Satan's
          ability to deceive the nations. Christ's Second Coming will be a
          visible, decisive end to history as we know it, at which time all will
          rise, believers will gather to meet Him, unbelievers will face
          judgment, and a New Heavens and New Earth will be established.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>
          Amillennialism does not deny Christ&#x27;s return. Amillennialists
          ardently affirm Christâ€™s physical, bodily return. It just holds that
          the nature of the Kingdom of God is spiritual before it is consummated
          physically at Christ's return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amillennialism is not an inherently pessimistic view. Some see it as a
          pessimistic view, expecting no significant progress of good before
          Christ&#x27;s return. The very opposite is true. Christ is ruling and
          reigning in Heaven right now. Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit, and
          there will be conversion to Christ to the ends of the earth. We rest
          assured knowing that God will save every last one of the elect. It
          does not teach that the world will be predominantly Christian before
          Christ comes back, or that the Church will become dominant politically
          or culturally. Instead our hope and reward is stored up in Heaven
          where Christ is.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Amillennialism takes a symbolic approach to the millennium, it
          does not apply a "non-literal" or "spiritual" approach to the entire
          Bible. Instead the approach is to understand the genre and context of
          biblical texts. It applies a Christ-centered interpretation to the
          Bible instead of a national, physical Israel-centered interpretation,
          and the New Testament is allowed to interpret the Old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amillennialism does not teach replacement theology, that the church
          replaces Israel or that God has a different plan for the church and
          Israel. Instead the Church, composed of both Jews and Gentiles who
          believe in Christ, is the spiritual continuation of Israel. This is
          rooted in the belief that God's promises to Israel in the Old
          Testament find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ and, by
          extension, in the Church as the body of Christ.
        </p>
        <h2>Biblical Support</h2>
        <p>
          In Luke 17:20-21 and Matthew 12:28, the Kingdom of God is a present,
          spiritual reality rather than a future physical kingdom. John 18:36
          indicates the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, affirming its
          existence in a different realm than earthly kingdoms. Ephesians
          1:20-23 and Colossians 1:13 make it clear that theres is an ongoing
          spiritual reign. During the Church Age, the church is to grow and do
          missions as commanded in Matthew 28:18-20 and modeled in Acts 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          The binding of Satan in Revelation 20 is specifically so that he won't
          decieve the nations any longer. 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12 supports that
          this is an ongoing, present limitation or restraining of Satan's
          power, achieved through Christ's work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inclusion of the gentiles was prophecied in Isaiah 49:6 and Hosea 2:23
          and is shown to be fulfilled in Acts 13:47 and Romans 9:25-26. There
          would be a New Covenant established according to Jeremiah 31:31-34
          which was fulfilled at Pentecost in Acts 2 and taught in Hebrews
          8:6-13. Jesus establishes the New Covenant according to Luke 22:20,
          which is open to all people, Jew and Gentile alike. There is only one
          people of God in Galatians 3:28-29 and Ephesians 2:11-22 because this
          covenant fulfills and transcends the Old Covenant made with Israel.
          Romans 4:16-17 illustrates that faith, not ethnicity, defines God's
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Matthew 24:29-31 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, it is clear that
          the second coming will be visible to all and is therefore still
          future. At that time, Jesus will come to all humanity as in Revelation
          20:11-15 and Matthew 25:31-46, and Revelation 21-22 and 2 Peter 3:13
          demonstrate a new heaven and new earth will also be established at
          that time without delay.
