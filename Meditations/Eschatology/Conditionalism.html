        <h1>Law</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 2:17</h2>
        <p>
          "but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;
          for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die."
        </p>

        <h2>Genesis 3:19</h2>
        <p>
          "You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the
          ground, for you were taken out of it. For you are dust, and you shall
          return to dust."
        </p>

        <h2>Genesis 3:22</h2>
        <p>
          "Yahweh God said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing
          good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the
          tree of life, and eat, and live forever—'"
        </p>

        <h1>Wisdom</h1>
        <h2>Psalm 9:5-6</h2>
        <p>
          "You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have
          blotted out their name forever and ever. The enemy is overtaken by
          endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown
          has perished."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 21:8-10</h2>
        <p>
          "Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will
          find out those who hate you. You will make them as a fiery furnace in
          the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The
          fire shall devour them. You will destroy their descendants from the
          earth, their posterity from among the children of men."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 37</h2>
        <p>
          "Don’t fret because of evildoers, neither be envious against those who
          work unrighteousness. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
          and wither like the green herb. Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in
          the land, and enjoy safe pasture. Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and
          he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trust also in him, and he will do this: he will make your
          righteousness shine out like light, and your justice as the noon day
          sun. Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him. Don’t fret because of
          him who prospers in his way, because of the man who makes wicked plots
          happen. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don’t fret; it leads only
          to evildoing. For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for
          Yahweh shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked
          will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.
          But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in
          the abundance of peace. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes
          at him with his teeth. The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that
          his day is coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast
          down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright on the path.
          Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be
          broken. Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance
          of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh
          upholds the righteous. Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. Their
          inheritance shall be forever. They shall not be disappointed in the
          time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the
          beauty of the fields. They will vanish— vanish like smoke. The wicked
          borrow, and don’t pay back, but the righteous give generously. For
          such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. Those who are
          cursed by him shall be cut off. A man’s steps are established by
          Yahweh. He delights in his way. Though he stumble, he shall not fall,
          for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous
          forsaken, nor his children begging for bread. All day long he deals
          graciously, and lends. His offspring is blessed. Depart from evil, and
          do good. Live securely forever. For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn’t
          forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of
          the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land, and
          live in it forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks justice.
          The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide. The
          wicked watch the righteous, and seek to kill him. Yahweh will not
          leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. Wait for
          Yahweh, and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land.
          When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself like a green
          tree in its native soil. But he passed away, and behold, he was not.
          Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man,
          and see the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace. As
          for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the
          wicked shall be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous is from
          Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. Yahweh helps
          them and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,
          because they have taken refuge in him."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 49:12</h2>
        <p>
          "But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure. He is like the animals
          that perish."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 73:16-28</h2>
        <p>
          "When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me— until I
          entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end. Surely you
          set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction. How
          they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with
          terrors. As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you
          will despise their fantasies. For my soul was grieved. I was
          embittered in my heart. I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute
          beast before you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have held my right hand. You will guide me with your counsel, and
          afterward receive me to glory. Whom do I have in heaven? There is no
          one on earth whom I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart fails,
          but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. For,
          behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed
          all those who are unfaithful to you. But it is good for me to come
          close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell
          of all your works."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 92:6-9</h2>
        <p>
          "A senseless man doesn’t know, neither does a fool understand this:
          though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers
          flourish, they will be destroyed forever. But you, Yahweh, are on high
          forever more. For behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for behold, your
          enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered."
        </p>

        <h2>Psalm 145:20</h2>
        <p>
          "Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but he will destroy all the
          wicked."
        </p>

        <h2>Proverbs 10:25-31</h2>
        <p>
          "When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; but the righteous
          stand firm forever. As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
          so is the sluggard to those who send him. The fear of Yahweh prolongs
          days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. The prospect of
          the righteous is joy, but the hope of the wicked will perish. The way
          of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, but it is a destruction to
          the workers of iniquity. The righteous will never be removed, but the
          wicked will not dwell in the land. The mouth of the righteous produces
          wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off."
        </p>

        <h2>Proverbs 24:19-20</h2>
        <p>
          "Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers, neither be envious of the
          wicked; for there will be no reward to the evil man. The lamp of the
          wicked will be snuffed out."
        </p>

        <h1>Prophets</h1>
        <h2>Isaiah 66:24</h2>
        <p>
          "They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have
          transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their
          fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
        </p>

        <h2>Malachi 4:1-3</h2>
        <p>
          "'For behold, the day comes, burning like a furnace, when all the
          proud and all who work wickedness will be stubble. The day that comes
          will burn them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them
          neither root nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of
          righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and
          leap like calves of the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for
          they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I
          make,' says Yahweh of Armies."

        <h2>Matthew 3:11-12</h2>
        <p>
          "I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after
          me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will
          baptize you in the Holy Spirit. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and
          he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his
          wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable
          fire."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 7:13-14</h2>
        <p>
          "Enter in by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is
          broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter in by
          it. How narrow is the gate and the way is restricted that leads to
          life! There are few who find it."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 10:28</h2>
        <p>
          "Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill
          the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body
          in Gehenna."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 13:30</h2>
        <p>
          "Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I
          will tell the reapers, 'First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind
          them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 13:38-42</h2>
        <p>
          "the field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the
          Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. The
          enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age,
          and the reapers are angels. As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered
          up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age. The Son
          of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his
          Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those who do iniquity, and
          will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and
          gnashing of teeth."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 19:29</h2>
        <p>
          "Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or
          mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will
          receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life."
        </p>

        <h2>Matthew 21:41</h2>
        <p>
          "They told him, 'He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and

        <h2>Luke 3:17</h2>
        <p>
          "His winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his

          burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
        </p>

        <h2>Luke 13:1-5</h2>
        <p>
          "Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the
          Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus
          answered them, 'Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners
          than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? I
          tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same
          way. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed
          them—do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who
          dwell in Jerusalem? I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will
          all perish in the same way.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Luke 17:26-33</h2>
        <p>
          "As it was in the days of Noah, even so it will also be in the days of
          the Son of Man. They ate, they drank, they married, and they were
          given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and
          the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise, even as it was in the
          days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
          planted, they built; but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it
          rained fire and sulfur from the sky and destroyed them all. It will be
          the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. In that day,
          he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not
          go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not
          turn back. Remember Lot’s wife! Whoever seeks to save his life loses
          it, but whoever loses his life preserves it."
