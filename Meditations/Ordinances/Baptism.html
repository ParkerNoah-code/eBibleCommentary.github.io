        <p>The baptism of Jesus in Matthew:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness
            of Judea, saying, 'Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
            For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
          </p>
          <p>
            'The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />
            make the way of the Lord ready!<br />
            Make his paths straight!'
          </p>
          <p>
            Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather
            belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. Then
            people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the
            Jordan went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan,
            confessing their sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his
            baptism, he said to them, 'You offspring of vipers, who warned you
            to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore produce fruit worthy of
            repentance! Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our
            father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to
            Abraham from these stones. Even now the ax lies at the root of the
            trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut
            down, and cast into the fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after
            me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He
            will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. His winnowing fork is in his
            hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will
            gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with
            unquenchable fire.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized
            by him. But John would have hindered him, saying, 'I need to be
            baptized by you, and you come to me?'
          </p>
          <p>
            But Jesus, answering, said to him, 'Allow it now, for this is the
            fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.' Then he allowed
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and
            behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God
            descending as a dove, and coming on him. Behold, a voice out of the
            heavens said, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
            pleased.'" (Matthew 3:1-17).

        <p>The baptism of Jesus in Mark:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
            repentance for forgiveness of sins. All the country of Judea and all
            those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
            Jordan river, confessing their sins. John was clothed with camel’s
            hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild
            honey. He preached, saying, 'After me comes he who is mightier than
            I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and
            loosen. I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy
            Spirit.'
          </p>
          <p>
            In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized
            by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up from the water, he saw
            the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A
            voice came out of the sky, 'You are my beloved Son, in whom I am
            well pleased.'" (Mark 1:4-11).
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>The baptism of Jesus in Luke:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the
            baptism of repentance for remission of sins. As it is written in the
            book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
            <br />'The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />‘Make ready
            the way of the Lord.<br />Make his paths straight.<br />Every valley
            will be filled.<br />Every mountain and hill will be brought low.<br />The
            crooked will become straight,<br />and the rough ways smooth.<br />All
            flesh will see God’s salvation.’'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by
            him, 'You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath
            to come? Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t
            begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for
            I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from
            these stones! Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees.
            Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and
            thrown into the fire.'
          </p>
          <p>The multitudes asked him, 'What then must we do?'</p>
          <p>
            He answered them, 'He who has two coats, let him give to him who has
            none. He who has food, let him do likewise.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him,
            'Teacher, what must we do?'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said to them, 'Collect no more than that which is appointed to
            you.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Soldiers also asked him, saying, 'What about us? What must we do?'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said to them, 'Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
            anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.'
          </p>
          <p>
            As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their
            hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, John
            answered them all, 'I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes
            who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy
            to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire. His
            winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his
            threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he
            will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the
            people, but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias,
            his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had
            done, added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized
            and was praying. The sky was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended
            in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the
            sky, saying 'You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.'"
            (Luke 3:3-22).

        <p>The baptism of Jesus in John:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "He said, 'I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make
            straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.'
          </p>
          <p>
            The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. They asked him,
            'Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor
            the prophet?'
          </p>
          <p>
            John answered them, 'I baptize in water, but among you stands one
            whom you don’t know. He is the one who comes after me, who is
            preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.'
            These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was
            baptizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, 'Behold, the
            Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom
            I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was
            before me.’ I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing
            in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.' John testified,
            saying, 'I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of
            heaven, and it remained on him. I didn’t recognize him, but he who
            sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see
            the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the
            Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of
            God.'" (John 1:23-34).

        <section>
          <p>
            "Jesus answered them, 'I also will ask you one question, which if
            you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these
            things. The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from
            men?'
          </p>
          <p>
            They reasoned with themselves, saying, 'If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he
            will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say,
            ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.'
            They answered Jesus, and said, 'We don’t know'...
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus said to them, 'Most certainly I tell you that the tax
            collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom
            before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and
            you didn’t believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes
            believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward,
            that you might believe him'...
          </p>
          <p>Jesus said to them, 'Did you never read in the Scriptures,</p>
          <p>
            ‘The stone which the builders rejected<br />was made the head of the
            corner.<br />This was from the Lord.<br />It is marvelous in our
            eyes’?
          </p>
          <p>
            'Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you and
            will be given to a nation producing its fruit. He who falls on this
            stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it
            will scatter him as dust.'" (Matthew 21:24-27, 31-44).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority has
            been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go and make disciples of
            all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
            and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I
            commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the
            age.' Amen." (Matthew 28:18-20).

            "They said to him, 'Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right
            hand and one at your left hand, in your glory.'
          </p>
          <p>
            But Jesus said to them, 'You don’t know what you are asking. Are you
            able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the
            baptism that I am baptized with?'
          </p>
          <p>They said to him, 'We are able.'</p>
          <p>
            Jesus said to them, 'You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink,
            and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
            but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give,
            but for whom it has been prepared.'" (Mark 10:37-40).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at
            the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of
            heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he
            had risen. He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the
            Good News to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized
            will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.'" (Mark
            16:14-16).

        <p>Other baptism texts in Luke:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing?
            Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in
            kings’ courts. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I
            tell you, and much more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is
            written,
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,<br />who will prepare
            your way before you.’
          </p>
          <p>
            'For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a
            greater prophet than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in God’s
            Kingdom is greater than he.'
          </p>
          <p>
            When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared
            God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism. But the
            Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being
            baptized by him themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            'To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What
            are they like? They are like children who sit in the marketplace and
            call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance.
            We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’ For John the Baptizer came neither
            eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ The
            Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a
            glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
            Wisdom is justified by all her children.'" (Luke 7:25-35).
          </p>
          <p>
            "I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.
            But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am
            until it is accomplished! Do you think that I have come to give
            peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division. For from
            now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two,
            and two against three. They will be divided, father against son, and
            son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against
            her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and
            daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law." (Luke 12:49-53).
          </p>
          <p>
            "He answered them, 'I also will ask you one question. Tell me: the
            baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?'
          </p>
          <p>
            They reasoned with themselves, saying, 'If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he
            will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’
            all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
            prophet.' They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus said to them, 'Neither will I tell you by what authority I do
            these things'...
          </p>
          <p>
            He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him and threw him out.
            The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my
            beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’ 'But
            when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying,
            ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be
            ours.’ Then they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What
            therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? He will come and
            destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.'

          <p>When they heard that, they said, 'May that never be!'</p>
          <p>
            But he looked at them and said, 'Then what is this that is written,
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The stone which the builders rejected<br />was made the chief
            cornerstone’?<br />Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken
            to pieces,<br />but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.'"

            water and Spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom. That which is
            born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is

            For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but
            that the world should be saved through him. He who believes in him
            is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already,
            because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.
            This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and
            men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were
            evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light and doesn’t come to
            the light, lest his works would be exposed. But he who does the
            truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they
            have been done in God.'" (John 3:5-8, 13-21).

            "After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of
            Judea. He stayed there with them and baptized. John also was
            baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.
            They came and were baptized; for John was not yet thrown into
            prison. Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John’s disciples
            with some Jews about purification. They came to John and said to
            him, 'Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have
            testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.'
          </p>
          <p>
            John answered, 'A man can receive nothing unless it has been given
            him from heaven. You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the
            Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’ He who has the bride is
            the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and
            hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.
            Therefore my joy is made full. He must increase, but I must
            decrease.
          </p>
          <p>
            'He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth
            belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from
            heaven is above all. What he has seen and heard, of that he
            testifies; and no one receives his witness. He who has received his
            witness has set his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God
            has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without
            measure. The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his
            hand. One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who
            disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on
            him.'

            Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
            was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus
            himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples), he left Judea and
            departed into Galilee." (John 3:22-4:3).

        <p>Accounts of baptism in Acts:</p>

            "To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many
            proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking
            about God’s Kingdom. Being assembled together with them, he
            commanded them, 'Don’t depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
            promise of the Father, which you heard from me. For John indeed
            baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not
            many days from now.'" (Acts 1:3-5).
          </p>
          <p>
            "'Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the
            Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of
            John to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must
            become a witness with us of his resurrection.'
          </p>
          <p>
            They put forward two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called
            Justus, and Matthias. They prayed and said, 'You, Lord, who know the
            hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen to
            take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell
            away, that he might go to his own place.' They drew lots for them,
            and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven
            apostles." (Acts 1:21-26).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in
            the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will
            receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and
            to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the
            Lord our God will call to himself.' With many other words he
            testified and exhorted them, saying, 'Save yourselves from this
            crooked generation!'
          </p>
          <p>
            Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were
            added that day about three thousand souls. They continued
            steadfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the
            breaking of bread, and prayer. Fear came on every soul, and many
            wonders and signs were done through the apostles. All who believed
            were together, and had all things in common. They sold their
            possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as
            anyone had need. Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord
            in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with
            gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favor with
            all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who
            were being saved." (Acts 2:38-47).
          </p>
          <p>
            "But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice
            sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself
            out to be some great one, to whom they all listened, from the least
            to the greatest, saying, 'This man is that great power of God.' They
            listened to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his
            sorceries. But when they believed Philip preaching good news
            concerning God’s Kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
            baptized, both men and women. Simon himself also believed. Being
            baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles
            occurring, he was amazed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
            received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who,
            when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive
            the Holy Spirit; for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had
            only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. Then they laid their
            hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw
            that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the
            apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying, 'Give me also this
            power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.'
            But Peter said to him, 'May your silver perish with you, because you
            thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! You have
            neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn’t right
            before God. Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God
            if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you." (Acts
            8:9-22).

        <p>Teaching on baptism in Paul:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
            abound? May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it
            any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into
            Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore
            with him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised
            from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk
            in newness of life. For if we have become united with him in the
            likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;
            knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body
            of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in
            bondage to sin." (Romans 6:1-6).
          </p>
          <p>
            "But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For
            you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. For as
            many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There
            is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there
            is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If
            you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs
            according to promise." (Galatians 3:25-29).
