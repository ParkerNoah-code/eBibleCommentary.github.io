          1. Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus
          Christ, to be unto the party baptized, a sign of his fellowship with
          him, in his death and resurrection; of his being engrafted into
          him;<sup>1</sup> of remission of sins;<sup>2</sup> and of giving up
          into God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in newness of
          life.<sup>3</sup>
          <br />
          (1. Romans 6:3-5; Colossians 2:12; Galatians 3:27 2. Mark 1:4; Acts
          22:16 3. Romans 6:4)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those who do actually profess repentance towards God, faith in, and
          obedience to, our Lord Jesus Christ, are the only proper subjects of
          this ordinance.<sup>4</sup>
          <br />
          (4. Mark 16:16; Acts 8:36-37, 2:41, 8:12, 18:8)
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The outward element to be used in this ordinance is water, wherein
          the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the
          Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<sup>5</sup>
          <br />
          (5. Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 8:38)
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Immersion, or dipping of the person in water, is necessary to the
          due administration of this ordinance.<sup>6</sup>
          <br />
          (6. Matthew 3:16; John 3:23)
        </p>

          I. Baptism is a sacrament of the new testament, ordained by Jesus
          Christ, (Mat 28:19); not only for the solemn admission of the party
          baptized into the visible Church, (1Co 12:13); but also, to be unto
          him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, (Rom 4:11; Col 2:11-12);
          of his ingrafting into Christ, (Gal 3:27; Rom 6:5); of regeneration,
          (Tts 3:5); of remission of sins, (Mar 1:4); and of his giving up unto
          God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life, (Rom 6:3-4).
          Which sacrament is, by Christ’s own appointment, to be continued in
          His Church until the end of the world, (Mat 28:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water,
          wherewith the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and
          of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a minister of the Gospel,
          lawfully called thereunto, (Mat 3:11; Jhn 1:33; Mat 28:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but
          Baptism is rightly administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon
          the person, ( Hbr 9:10, 19-22; Act 2:41; Act 16:33; Mar 7:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience
          unto Christ, (Mar 16:15-16; Act 8:37-38); but also the infants of one,
          or both, believing parents, are to be baptized, (Gen 17:7, 9; Gal 3:9,
          14; Col 2:11-12; Act 2:38-39; Rom 4:11-12; 1Co 7:14; Mat 28:19; Mar
          10:13-16; Luk 18:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance,
          (Luk 7:30; Exd 4:24-26); yet grace and salvation are not so
          inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated, or
          saved, without it, (Rom 4:11; Act 10:2, 4, 22, 31, 45, 47); or, that
          all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated, (Act 8:13, 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein
          it is administered, (Jhn 3:5, 8); yet, notwithstanding, by the right
          use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but
          really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether
          of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the
          counsel of God’s own will, in His appointed time, (Gal 3:27; Tts 3:5;
          Eph 5:25-26; Act 2:38, 41).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administered unto any
          person, (Tts 3:5).
