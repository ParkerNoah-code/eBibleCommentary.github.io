        <p>The Baptism of Jesus:</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            "In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness
            of Judea, saying, 'Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
            For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
          </p>
          <p>
            'The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />
            make the way of the Lord ready!<br />
            Make his paths straight!'
          </p>
          <p>
            Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather
            belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. Then
            people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the
            Jordan went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan,
            confessing their sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his
            baptism, he said to them, 'You offspring of vipers, who warned you
            to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore produce fruit worthy of
            repentance! Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our
            father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to
            Abraham from these stones. Even now the ax lies at the root of the
            trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut
            down, and cast into the fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after
            me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He
            will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. His winnowing fork is in his
            hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will
            gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with
            unquenchable fire.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized
            by him. But John would have hindered him, saying, 'I need to be
            baptized by you, and you come to me?'
          </p>
          <p>
            But Jesus, answering, said to him, 'Allow it now, for this is the
            fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.' Then he allowed
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and
            behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God
            descending as a dove, and coming on him. Behold, a voice out of the
            heavens said, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
            pleased.'" (Matthew 3:1-17).
          </p>
          <p>
            "John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
            repentance for forgiveness of sins. All the country of Judea and all
            those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
            Jordan river, confessing their sins. John was clothed with camel’s
            hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild
            honey. He preached, saying, 'After me comes he who is mightier than
            I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and
            loosen. I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy
            Spirit.'
          </p>
          <p>
            In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized
            by John in the Jordan. Immediately coming up from the water, he saw
            the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. A
            voice came out of the sky, 'You are my beloved Son, in whom I am
            well pleased.'" (Mark 1:4-11).
          </p>
          <p>
            "He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the
            baptism of repentance for remission of sins. As it is written in the
            book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
            <br />'The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />‘Make ready
            the way of the Lord.<br />Make his paths straight.<br />Every valley
            will be filled.<br />Every mountain and hill will be brought low.<br />The
            crooked will become straight,<br />and the rough ways smooth.<br />All
            flesh will see God’s salvation.’'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by
            him, 'You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath
            to come? Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t
            begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for
            I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from
            these stones! Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees.
            Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and
            thrown into the fire.'
          </p>
          <p>The multitudes asked him, 'What then must we do?'</p>
          <p>
            He answered them, 'He who has two coats, let him give to him who has
            none. He who has food, let him do likewise.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him,
            'Teacher, what must we do?'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said to them, 'Collect no more than that which is appointed to
            you.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Soldiers also asked him, saying, 'What about us? What must we do?'
          </p>
          <p>
            He said to them, 'Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
            anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.'
          </p>
          <p>
            As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their
            hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, John
            answered them all, 'I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes
            who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy
            to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire. His
            winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his
            threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he
            will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the
            people, but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias,
            his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had
            done, added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized
            and was praying. The sky was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended
            in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the
            sky, saying 'You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.'"
            (Luke 3:3-22).
          </p>
          <p>
            "He said, 'I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make
            straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.'
          </p>
          <p>
            The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. They asked him,
            'Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor
            the prophet?'
          </p>
          <p>
            John answered them, 'I baptize in water, but among you stands one
            whom you don’t know. He is the one who comes after me, who is
            preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.'
            These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was
            baptizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, 'Behold, the
            Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom
            I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was
            before me.’ I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing
            in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.' John testified,
            saying, 'I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of
            heaven, and it remained on him. I didn’t recognize him, but he who
            sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see
            the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptizes in the
            Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of
            God.'" (John 1:23-34).
