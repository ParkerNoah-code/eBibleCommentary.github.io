        <h2>Infant Baptism</h2>
        <p>
            Infant baptism, also known as paedobaptism, is a practice where 
            infants or young children are baptized into the Christian faith while they are still unconverted. 
            It is practiced in the majority of different theological traditions, 
            but there are widely different theologies, meanings, and modes of baptism between them.
            Most paedobaptists will candidly admit that infant baptism is not taught 
            or recorded in scripture, but a brief survey of passages that are sometimes alleged to be 
            infant baptism will show this. Since infant baptism is not in scripture,
            a history of its development and a survey of different theological traditions 
            will be examined to understand what it is. Next, the arguments in support of 
            infant baptism will be layed out and challenged. Finally, its nature will be demonstrated 
            to be harmful and antithetical to scripture.

        <h2>Testimony about Scripture</h2>
<p>
Nearly all the advocates and defenders of infant baptism have, with considerable candor, admitted that it was not instituted by Christ, nor practiced by the apostles or their immediate successors.
</p><p>
Dr. Wall, of the English Church, who wrote the History of Infant Baptism, a work so able, that the assembled clergy, in convocation, gave him a vote of thanks for his learned and able defence of this custom, says: "Among all the persons that are recorded as baptized by the apostles, there is no express mention of any infants." (Hist. Inf. Bap., Introd., pp. 1, 55)
</p><p>
Fuller says: "We do freely confess there is neither express precept nor precedent in the New Testament for the baptizing of infants." (Infants' Advoc., pp. 71, 150)
</p><p>
Bp. Burnett says: "There is no express precept or rule given in the New Testament for the baptism of infants." (Expos. 39 Articles, 27 Art)
</p><p>
Baxter says: "I conclude that all examples of baptism in Scripture do mention only the administration of it to the professors of saving faith; and the precepts give us no other direction."(Disput. of Right to Sacra., p. 156)
</p><p>
Luther says: "It cannot be proved by the sacred Scriptures, that infant baptism was instituted by Christ, or begun by the first Christians after the apostles." (Vanity Inf. Bap., part 2, p. 8. See Booth's Pedo. Er., part 2, Ch. i)
</p><p>
Dr. Goodwin says: "Baptism supposeth regeneration sure in itself, first. Sacraments are never administered for to begin, or to work grace; you suppose children to believe before you baptize them. Read all the Acts, still it is said, “They believed, and were baptized." (Works, vol. i., part 1, p. 200)
</p><p>
Celarius says: "Infant baptism is neither commanded in the sacred Scriptures, nor is it confirmed by apostolic examples." (Shyn. Hist. Mennon., p. 168)
</p><p>
Limboroh says: "There is no instance can be produced from which it may indisputably be inferred that any child was baptized by the apostles. (Com. Syst. Divin., B. 5. Ch. xxii., sec. 2)
</p><p>
Dr. Field says: "The baptism of infants is therefore named a tradition, because it is not expressly delivered in Scripture that the apostles did baptize infants; nor any express precept there found that they should do so." (On the Church, p. 375)
</p><p>
Neander says: "Baptism was administered at first only to adults, as men were accustomed to conceive of baptism and faith, as strictly connected. We have all reason for not deriving infant baptism from apostolic institution." (Ch. Hist., vol. i., p. 311. Torrey's Trans. Also, Plant. and Train., vol. i., p 222)
</p><p>
Olshausen says: "We cannot in truth find anywhere a reliable proof-text in favor of infant baptism." (Comment. Acts 15:14, 15)
</p><p>
Hahn says: "Neither in the Scriptures, nor during the first hundred and fifty years, is a sure example of infant baptism to be found." (Theology, p. 556)
</p><p>
Robert Barclay says: "As to the baptism of infants, it is a mere human tradition, for which neither precept nor practice is to be found in all the Scriptures." (Apology, Prop. 12)
</p><p>
William Penn says: There is "not one text of Scripture to prove that sprinkling in the face was the water baptism, or that children were the subjects of water baptism in the first times." (Def. of Gospel Truths, p. 82)
</p><p>
Prof. Lange says: "All attempts to make out infant baptism from the New Testament fail. It is totally opposed to the spirit of the apostolic age, and to the fundamental principles of the New Testament." (Inf. Bap., p. 101. Dune. Hist. Bap., p. 224)
</p><p>
Hagenbach says: "The passages from Scripture cited in favor of infant baptism as a usage of the primitive church, are doubtful, and prove nothing." (Hist. Doct., pp. 190-193)
</p><p>
Prof. Jacobi says: "Infant baptism was established neither by Christ nor by the apostles." (Art. Bap., Kitto's Cycl. Bib. Lit.)
</p><p>
Dr. Hanna says:" Scripture knows nothing of the baptism of infants." (North Brit. Review, Aug. 1852)

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Tertullian is the first who mentions something like this custom, and he earnestly opposes it. 
            This was at the close of the second century, or about A.D. 200:
        </p><p>
            "And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even age, of each individual, 
            the delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For 
            why is it necessary — if (baptism itself) is not so necessary — that the sponsors likewise 
            should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves, by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil 
            their promises, and may be disappointed by the development of an evil disposition, in those for 
            whom they stood? The Lord does indeed say, Forbid them not to come unto me. Let them come, then, 
            while they are growing up; let them come while they are learning, while they are learning whither 
            to come; let them become Christians when they have become able to know Christ. Why does the 
            innocent period of life hasten to the remission of sins? More caution will be exercised in worldly 
            matters: so that one who is not trusted with earthly substance is trusted with divine! Let them 
            know how to ask for salvation, that you may seem (at least) to have given to him that asks. For 
            no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred — in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, 
            alike in such as never were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their 
            freedom — until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence. If any 
            understand the weighty import of baptism, they will fear its reception more than its delay: sound 
            faith is secure of salvation." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm" 
            target="_blank">On Baptism</a>, ch 18).
        </p><p>
            His opposition to it proves two things. First, that it was in occasional use at least; and 
            second, that it was of recent origin. For it must have been in use to be mentioned at all, 
            and if it had long been in use, it would have been earlier alluded to. Also note that the word 
            he uses refers to little growing children, from six to ten years old. Tertullian, in his opposition 
            to infant baptism, does not say one word of newborn infants. Dr. Wall says: "If we except Tertullian, 
            Vicentius, A.D. 419, is the first man on record that ever said that children might be saved without 
            baptism." (Hist. Inf. Bap., p. 1., Ch. xx., p. 232).
        </p><p>
            Hippolytus, bishop of Pontus, writing in the first half of the third century, bears this testimony: 
            "We in our days never defended the baptism of children, which in our day had only begun to be 
            practiced in some regions." (Hippolytus and his Age, vol. i., p. 184. See Duncan's Hist. Bap., 
            p. 115.—Curtis' Prog. Bap. Principles, p. 101)
        </p><p>
            Cyprian, an African bishop, at the close of the third century, urged the baptism of infants proper 
            because of the regenerating efficacy of the ordinance. He and his associates were the first to take 
            this ground. (Hippol. and his Age, vol. iii., pp. 192-5. See Curtis' Prog. Bap. Prin., p. 125).
        </p><p>
            Chrysostom, writing about A.D. 398, as cited by Suicerus, says: "It is impossible without baptism 
            to obtain the kingdom. It is impossible to be saved without it." And as cited by Wall, he says: "If 
            sudden death seize us before we are baptized, though we have a thousand good qualities, there is 
            nothing to be expected but hell.” (Suicer. Thesau. EccI., vol. i., p. 3).

        <h2>Theological Traditions</h2>
        <p>
            The Catholic Church held to baptismal regeneration, and in the Council of Trent thus declared it: 
            "If any one shall say that baptism is not necessary to salvation, let him be accursed." (Cat. Coun. Trent, p. 165, 175)
        </p><p>
            The Greek Church holds the same dogma. Cyril, patriarch of Constantinople, and declares: "that 
            both original and actual sins are forgiven to those who are baptized in the manner which our Lord 
            requires in the gospel." (Confes. Ch. Faith, Ch. xvi. 1631)
        </p><p>
            The Protestant Churches generally have held, and to a degree do still hold, the same unscriptural 
            dogma. See the following Protestant confessions, which embrace it: the Confession of Helvetia, that 
            of Bohemia, of Augsburg, of Saxony, of Wittemburg, of Sueveland, of the Church of England, and of 
            the Westminster Assembly.
        </p><p>
            The Westminster Confession states: "IV. Not only those that do actually profess faith in and 
            obedience unto Christ, (Mar 16:15-16; Act 8:37-38); but also the infants of one, or both, believing 
            parents, are to be baptized, (Gen 17:7, 9; Gal 3:9, 14; Col 2:11-12; Act 2:38-39; Rom 4:11-12; 1Co 7:14; 
            Mat 28:19; Mar 10:13-16; Luk 18:15)." Ch XXVIII, IV.
