        <h2>Its Objects</h2>
        <p>
          We have now reached a point in our discussion of this mighty theme
          where it is timely for us to ask the question, Who are the ones that
          God justifies? The answer to that question will necessarily vary
          according to the mental position we occupy. From the standpoint of
          God&#x27;s eternal decrees the reply must be, God&#x27;s elect: Romans
          8:33. From the standpoint of the effects produced by quickening
          operations of the Holy Spirit the reply must be, those who believe:
          Acts 13:39. But from the standpoint of what they are, considered in
          themselves, the reply must be, the ungodly: Romans 4:5. The persons
          are the same, yet contemplated in three different relations. But here
          a difficulty presents itself: If faith be essential in order to
          justification, and if a fallen sinner must be quickened by the Holy
          Spirit before he can believe, then with what propriety can a
          regenerated person, with the spiritual grace of faith already in his
          heart, be described as &quot;ungodly&quot;? The difficulty pointed out
          above is self-created. It issues from confounding things which differ
          radically. It is the result of bringing in the experimental state of
          the person justified, when justification has to do only with his
          judicial status. We would emphasize once more the vital importance of
          keeping quite distinct in our minds the objective and subjective
          aspects of truth, the legal and the experimental: unless this be
          steadily done, nothing but confusion and mistakes can mark our
          thinking. When contemplating what he is in himself, considered alone,
          even the Christian mournfully cries &quot;O wretched man that I
          am&quot;; but when he views himself in Christ, as justified from all
          things, he triumphantly exclaims, &quot;who shall lay anything to my
          charge!&quot; Above, we have pointed out that from the viewpoint of
          God&#x27;s eternal decrees the question &quot;Who are the ones whom
          God justifies?&quot; must be &quot;the elect.&quot; And this brings us
          to a point on which some eminent Calvinists have erred, or at least,
          have expressed themselves faultily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the older theologians, when expounding this doctrine,
          contended for the eternal justification of the elect, affirming that
          God pronounced them righteous before the foundation of the world, and
          that their justification was then actual and complete, remaining so
          throughout their history in time, even during the days of their
          unregeneracy and unbelief; and that the only difference their faith
          made was in making manifest God&#x27;s eternal justification in their
          consciences. This is a serious mistake, resulting (again) from failure
          to distinguish between things which differ. As an immanent act of
          God&#x27;s mind, in which all things (which are to us past, present,
          and future) were cognized by Him, the elect might be said to be
          justified from all eternity. And, as an immutable act of God&#x27;s
          will, which cannot be frustrated, the same may be predicated again.
          But as an actual, formal, historical sentence, pronounced by God upon
          us, not so. We must distinguish between God&#x27;s looking upon the
          elect in the purpose of his grace, and the objects of justification
          lying under the sentence of the law: in the former, He loved His
          people with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3); in the latter, we
          were &quot;by nature the children of wrath, even as others&quot;
          (Ephesians 2:3). Until they believe, every descendant of Adam is
          &quot;condemned already&quot; (John 3:18), and to be under God&#x27;
          condemnation is the very opposite of being justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his ponderous treatise on justification, the Puritan Thomas Goodwin
          made clear some vital distinctions, which if carefully observed will
          preserve us from error on this point. &quot;1. In the everlasting
          covenant. We may say of all spiritual blessings in Christ, what is
          said of Christ Himself, that their &#x27;goings forth are from
          everlasting.&#x27; Justified then we were when first elected, though
          not in our own persons, yet in our Head (Ephesians 1:3). 2. There is a
          farther act of justifying us, which passed from God towards us in
          Christ, upon His payment and performance at His resurrection (Romans
          4:25, 1 Timothy 3:16). 3. But these two acts of justification are
          wholly out of us, immanent acts in God, and though they concern us and
          are towards us, yet not acts of God upon us, they being performed
          towards us not as actually existing in ourselves, but only as existing
          in our Head, who covenanted for us and represented us: so as though by
          those acts we are estated into a right and title to justification, yet
          the benefit and possession of that estate we have not without a
          farther act being passed upon us.&quot; Before regeneration we are
          justified by existing in our Head only, held in trust for us, as
          children under age. In addition to which, we &quot;are to be in our
          own persons, though still through Christ, possessed of it, and to have
          all the deeds and evidences of it committed to the custody and
          apprehension of our faith. We are in our own persons made true owners
          and enjoyers of it, which is immediately done at that instant when we
          first believe; which act (of God) is the completion and accomplishment
          of the former two, and is that grand and famous justification by faith
          which the Scripture so much inculcates—note the &#x27;now&#x27; in
          Romans 5:9, 11; 8:1!... God does judge and pronounce His elect ungodly
          and unjustified until they believe&quot; (Ibid.) God&#x27;s elect
          enter this world in precisely the same condition and circumstances as
          do the non-elect. They are &quot;by nature the children of wrath, even
          as others&quot; (Ephesians 2:3), that is, they are under the
          condemnation of their original sin in Adam (Romans 5:12, 18, 19) and
          they are under the curse of God&#x27;s law because of their own
          constant transgressions of it (Galatians 3:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          The sword of divine justice is suspended over their heads, and the
          Scriptures denounce them as rebels against the Most High. As yet,
          there is nothing whatever to distinguish them from those who are
          &quot;fitted to destruction.&quot; Their state is woeful to the last
          degree, their situation perilous beyond words; and when the Holy
          Spirit awakens them from the sleep of death, the first message which
          falls upon their ears is, &quot;Flee from the wrath to come.&quot; But
          how and where, they, as yet, know not. Then it is they are ready for
          the message of the gospel. Let us turn now to the more immediate
          answer to our opening inquiry, Who are the ones that God justifies? A
          definite reply is given in Romans 4:5: &quot;Him that justifies
          the&quot;—whom? the holy, the faithful, the fruitful? no, the very
          reverse: &quot;Him that justifies the ungodly.&quot; What a strong,
          bold, and startling word is this! It becomes yet more emphatic when we
          observe what precedes: &quot;But to him that works not, but believes
          on Him that justifies the ungodly.&quot; The subjects of
          justification, then, are viewed in themselves, apart from Christ, as
          not only destitute of a perfect righteousness, but as having no
          acceptable works to their account. They are denominated, and
          considered as ungodly when the sentence of justification is pronounced
          upon them. The mere sinner is the subject on which grace is magnified,
          toward which grace reigns in justification!
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;To say, he who works not is justified through believing, is to
          say that his works, whatever they be, have no influence in his
          justification, nor has God, in justifying him, any respect unto them.
          Wherefore he alone who works not, is the subject of justification, the
          person to be justified. That is, God considers no man&#x27;s works, no
          man&#x27;s duties of obedience, in his justification; seeing we are
          justified freely by His grace&quot; (John Owen). Those whom God, in
          His transcendent mercy, justifies, are not the obedient, but the
          disobedient; not those who have been loyal and loving subjects of His
          righteous government, but they who have stoutly defied Him and
          trampled His laws beneath their feet. Those whom God justifies are
          lost sinners, lying in a state of defection from Him, under a loss of
          original righteousness (in Adam) and by their own transgressions
          brought in guilty before His tribunal (Romans 3:19). They are those
          who by character and conduct have no claim upon divine blessing, and
          deserve nothing but unsparing judgment at God&#x27;s hand. &quot;Him
          that justifies the ungodly.&quot; It is deplorable to see how many
          able commentators have weakened the force of this by affirming that,
          while the subject of justification is &quot;ungodly&quot; up to the
          time of his justification, he is not so at the moment of justification
          itself. They argue that, inasmuch as the subject of justification is a
          believer at the moment of his justification and that believing
          presupposes regeneration—a work of divine grace wrought in the
          heart—he could not be designated &quot;ungodly.&quot; This seeming
          difficulty is at once removed by calling to mind that justification is
          entirely a law matter and not an experimental thing at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sight of God&#x27;s law every one whom God justifies is
          &quot;ungodly&quot; until Christ&#x27;s righteousness is made over to
          him. The awful sentence &quot;ungodly&quot; rests as truly upon the
          purest virgin as much as it does upon the foulest prostitute until God
          imputes Christ&#x27;s obedience to her. &quot;Him that justifies the
          ungodly.&quot; These words cannot mean less than that God, in the act
          of justification, has no regard whatever to anything good resting to
          the credit of the person He justifies. They declare, emphatically,
          that immediately prior to that divine act, God beholds the subject
          only as unrighteous, ungodly, wicked, so that no good, either in or by
          the person justified, can possibly be the ground on which or the
          reason for which He justifies him. This is further evident from the
          words &quot;to him that works not&quot;: that this includes not only
          works which the ceremonial law required, but all works of morality and
          godliness, appear from the fact that the same person who is said to
          &quot;work not&quot; is designated &quot;ungodly.&quot; Finally,
          seeing that the faith which belongs to justification is here said to
          be &quot;counted for (or &quot;unto&quot;) righteousness,&quot; it is
          clear that the person to whom &quot;righteousness&quot; is imputed, is
          destitute of righteousness in himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A parallel passage to the one which has just been before us is found
          in Isaiah 43. There we hear God saying, &quot;I, even I, am He who
          blots out your transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember
          your sins&quot; (verse 25). And to whom does God say this? To those
          who had sincerely endeavored to please Him? To those who, though they
          had occasionally been overtaken in a fault, had, in the main, served
          Him faithfully? No, indeed; very far from it. Instead, in the
          immediate context we find Him saying to them, &quot;But you have not
          called upon Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel. You
          have bought Me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled Me
          with the fat of your sacrifices: but you have made Me to serve with
          your sins, you have wearied Me with your iniquities&quot; (verses 22,
          24). They were, then, thoroughly &quot;ungodly&quot;; yet to them the
          Lord declared, &quot;I, even I, am He who blots out your
          transgressions&quot;—why? Because of something good in them or from
          them? No, &quot;for Mine own sake&quot;! Further confirmation of what
          has been before us in Romans 4:5 is found in both what immediately
          precedes and what follows. In verses 1-3 the case of Abraham is
          considered, and the proof given that he was not &quot;justified by
          works,&quot; but on the ground of righteousness being imputed to him
          on his believing. &quot;Now if a person of such victorious faith,
          exalted piety, and amazing obedience as his was, did not obtain
          acceptance with God on account of his own duties, but by an imputed
          righteousness; who shall pretend to an interest in the Heavenly
          blessing, in virtue of his own sincere endeavors, or pious
          performances?—performances not fit to be named, in comparison with
          those that adorned the conduct and character of Jehovah&#x27;s
          friend&quot; (A. Booth).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having shown that the father of all believers was regarded by the Lord
          as an &quot;ungodly&quot; person, having no good works to his credit
          at the moment of his justification, the apostle next cited
          David&#x27;s description of the truly blessed man. &quot;And how does
          the royal Psalmist describe him? To what does he attribute his
          acceptance with God? To an inherent, or to an imputed righteousness?
          Does he represent him as attaining the happy state, and as enjoying
          the precious privilege, in consequence of performing sincere
          obedience, and of keeping the law to the best of his power? No such
          thing. His words are, &#x27;Blessed are they whose iniquities are
          forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the
          Lord will not impute sin&#x27; (verses 7-9). The blessed man is here
          described as one who is, in himself, a polluted creature, and a guilty
          criminal. As one who, before grace made the difference, was on a level
          with the rest of mankind; equally unworthy, and equally wretched: and
          the sacred penman informs us that all his blessedness arises from an
          imputed righteousness&quot; (A. Booth). &quot;Him that justifies the
          ungodly.&quot; Here is the very heart of the gospel. Many have argued
          that God can only pronounce just, and treat as such, those who are
          inherently righteous; but if this was so, what good news would there
          be for sinful men? Enemies of the Truth insist that for God to
          pronounce just those whom His law condemns would be a judicial
          fiction. But Romans 4:5 makes known a divine miracle: something only
          God could have achieved. The miracle announced by the gospel is that
          God comes to the ungodly with a mercy that is righteous, and in spite
          of all their depravity and rebellion, enables them through faith (on
          the ground of Christ&#x27;s righteousness) to enter into a new and
          blessed relation with Himself. The Scriptures speak of mercy, but it
          is not mercy coming in to make up the deficiencies and forgive the
          slips of the virtuous, but mercy extended through Christ to the chief
          of sinners. The gospel which proclaims mercy through the atonement of
          the Lord Jesus is distinguished from every religious system of man, by
          holding out salvation to the guiltiest of the human race, through
          faith in the blood of the Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          God&#x27;s Son came into this world not only to save sinners, but even
          the chief of sinners, the worst of His enemies. Mercy is extended
          freely to the most violent and determined rebel. Here, and here only,
          is a refuge for the guilty. Is the trembling reader conscious that he
          is a great sinner, then that is the very reason why you should come to
          Christ: the greater your sins, the greater your need of the Savior.
          There are some who appear to think that Christ is a Physician who can
          cure only such patients as are not dangerously ill, that there are
          some cases so desperate as to be incurable, beyond His skill. What an
          affront to His power, what a denial of His sufficiency! Where can a
          more extreme case be found than that of the thief on the cross? He was
          at the very point of death, on the very brink of Hell! A guilty
          criminal, an incorrigible outlaw, justly condemned even by men. He had
          reviled the Savior suffering by his side. Yet, at the end, he turned
          to Him and said, &quot;Lord remember me.&quot; Was his plea refused?
          Did the Physician of souls regard his as a hopeless case? No, blessed
          be His name, He at once responded &quot;Today shall you be with Me in
          Paradise.&quot; Only unbelief shuts the vilest out of Heaven.
          &quot;Him that justifies the ungodly.&quot; And how can the thrice
          holy God righteously do such a thing? Because &quot;Christ died for
          the UNGODLY&quot; (Romans 5:6). God&#x27;s righteous grace comes to us
          through the law-honoring, justice-satisfying, sin-atoning Work of the
          Lord Jesus! Here, then, is the very essence of the gospel: the
          proclamation of God&#x27;s amazing grace, the declaration of divine
          bounty, altogether irrespective of human worth or merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the great Satisfaction of His Son, God has &quot;brought near HIS
          righteousness&quot; (Isaiah 46:13). &quot;We do not need to go up to
          Heaven for it; that would imply Christ had never come down. Nor do we
          need to go down to the depths of the earth for it; that would say
          Christ had never been buried and had never risen. It is near. We do
          not need to exert ourselves to bring it near, nor do anything to
          attract it towards us. It is near... The office of faith is not to
          work, but to cease working; not to do anything, but to own that all is
          done&quot; (A. Bonar). Faith is the one link between the sinner and
          the Savior. Not faith as a work, which must be properly performed to
          qualify us for pardon. Not faith as a religious duty, which must be
          gone through according to certain rules in order to induce Christ to
          give us the benefits of His finished work. No, but faith simply
          extended as an empty hand, to receive everything from Christ for
          nothing. Reader, you may be the very &quot;chief of sinners,&quot; yet
          is your case not hopeless. You may have sinned against much light,
          great privileges, exceptional opportunities; you may have broken every
          one of the Ten Commandments in thought, word and deed; your body may
          be filled with disease from wickedness, your head white with the
          winter of old age; you may already have one foot in Hell; and yet even
          now, if you but take your place alongside of the dying thief, and
          trust in the divine efficacy of the precious blood of the Lamb, you
          shall be plucked as a brand from the burning. God &quot;justifies the
          ungodly.&quot; Hallelujah! If He did not, the writer had been in Hell
          long ago.
