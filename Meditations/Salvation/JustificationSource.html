        <h2>Its Source</h2>
        Let us here review, briefly, the ground which we have already covered.
        We have seen, first, that "to justify" means to pronounce righteous. It
        is not a divine work, but a divine verdict, the sentence of the Supreme
        Court, declaring that the one justified stands perfectly conformed to
        all the requirements of the law. Justification assures the believer that
        the Judge of all the earth is for him, and not against him: that justice
        itself is on his side. Second, we dwelt upon the great and seemingly
        insolvable problem which is thereby involved: how a God of truth can
        pronounce righteous one who is completely devoid of righteousness, how
        He can receive into His judicial favor one who is a guilty criminal, how
        He can exercise mercy without insulting justice, how He can be gracious
        and yet enforce the high demands of His law. Third, we have shown that
        the solution to this problem is found in the perfect satisfaction which
        the incarnate Son rendered unto divine law, and that on the basis of
        that satisfaction God can truthfully and righteously pronounce just all
        who truly believe the gospel. In our last chapter we pointed out that
        the satisfaction which Christ made to the divine law consists of two
        distinct parts, answering to the twofold need of him who is to be
        justified. First, as a responsible creature I am under binding
        obligations to keep the law—to love God with all my heart and my
        neighbor as myself. Second, as a criminal I am under the condemnation
        and curse of that law which I have constantly transgressed in thought
        and word and deed. Therefore, if another was to act as my surety and
        make reparation for me, he must perfectly obey all the precepts of the
        law, and then endure the awful penalty of the law. That is exactly what
        was undertaken and accomplished by the Lord Jesus in His virtuous life
        and vicarious death. By Him every demand of the law was fulfilled; by
        Him every obligation of the believer was fully met. It has been objected
        by some that the obedience of Christ could not be imputed to the account
        of others, for being "made under the law" (Galatians 4:4) as man, He
        owed submission to the law on His own account. This is a serious
        mistake, arising out of a failure to recognize the absolute uniqueness
        of the Man Christ Jesus. Unlike us, He was never placed under the Adamic
        Covenant, and therefore He owed nothing to the law. Moreover, the
        manhood of Christ never had a separate existence: in the virgin's womb
        the eternal Son took the seed of Mary into union with His Deity, so that
        whereas the first man was of the earth, earthy, "the second Man is the
        Lord from Heaven" (1 Corinthians 15:47), and as such He was infinitely
        superior to the law, owing nothing to it, being personally possessed of
        all the excellencies of Deity. Even while He walked this earth "in Him
        dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." It was entirely for His
        peoples' sake that the God-man Mediator was "made under the law." It was
        in order to work out for them a perfect righteousness, which should be
        placed to their account, that He took upon Himself the form of a servant
        and became "obedient unto death." What has been said above supplies the
        answer to another foolish objection which has been made against this
        blessed truth, namely, that if the obedience of the Man Christ Jesus
        were transferable it would be available only for one other man, seeing
        that every human being is required to obey the law, and that if
        vicarious obedience be acceptable to God then there would have to be as
        many separate sureties as there are believers who are saved. That would
        be true if the "surety" were merely human, but inasmuch as the Surety
        provided by God is the God-man Mediator, His righteousness is of
        infinite value, for the law was more "honored and magnified" by the
        obedience of "the Lord from Heaven" than had every member of the human
        race perfectly kept it. The righteousness of the God-man Mediator is of
        infinite value, and therefore available for as many as God is pleased to
        impute it unto. The value or merit of an action increases in proportion
        to the dignity of the person who performs it, and He who obeyed in the
        room and stead of the believer was not only a holy man, but the Son of
        the living God. Moreover, let it be steadily borne in mind that the
        obedience which Christ rendered to the law was entirely voluntary. Prior
        to His incarnation, He was under no obligation to the law, for He had
        Himself (being God) formulated that law. His being made of a woman and
        made under the law was entirely a free act on His own part. We come into
        being and are placed under the law without our consent; but the Lord
        from Heaven existed before His incarnation, and assumed our nature by
        His spontaneous act: "Lo, I come... I delight to do Your will" (Psalm
        40:7, 8). No other person could use such language, for it clearly
        denotes a liberty to act or not to act, which no mere creature
        possesses. Placing Himself under the law and rendering obedience to it
        was founded solely on His own voluntary deed. His obedience was
        therefore a "free will offering," and therefore as He did not owe
        obedience to the law by any prior obligation, not being at all necessary
        for Himself, it is available for imputation to others, that they should
        be rewarded for it. If, then, the reader has been able to follow us
        closely in the above observations, it should be clear to him that when
        Scripture speaks of God "justifying the ungodly" the meaning is that the
        believing sinner is brought into an entirely new relation to the law;
        that in consequence of Christ's righteousness being made over to him, he
        is now absolved from all liability to punishment, and is given a title
        to all the reward merited by Christ's obedience. Blessed, blessed truth
        for comforting the conscientious Christian who daily groans under a
        sense of his sad failures and who mourns because of his lack of
        practical conformity to the image of Christ. Satan is ever ready to
        harass such an one and tell him his profession is vain. But it is the
        believer's privilege to overcome him by "the blood of the Lamb" (Rev.
        12:11)—to remind himself anew that Another has atoned for all his sins,
        and that despite his innumerable shortcomings he still stands "accepted
        in the Beloved" (Ephesians 1:6). If I am truly resting on the finished
        work of Christ for me, the Devil cannot successfully lay anything to my
        charge before God, though if I am walking carelessly He will suffer him
        to charge my conscience with unrepented and unconfessed sins. In the
        last chapter, under the nature of justification, we saw that the
        constituent elements of this divine blessing are two in number, the one
        being negative in its character, the other positive. The negative
        blessing is the cancellation of guilt, or the remission of sins—the
        entire record of the believer's transgressions of the law, filed upon
        the divine docket, having been blotted out by the precious blood of
        Christ. The positive blessing is the bestowal upon the believer of an
        inalienable title to the reward which the obedience of Christ merited
        for him— that reward is life, the judicial favor of God, Heaven itself.
        The unchanging sentence of the law is "the man whio does those things
        shall live by them" (Romans 10:5). As we read in Romans 7:10, "the
        commandment, which was ordained to life." It is just as true that
        obedience to the law secured life, as disobedience insured death. When
        the young ruler asked Christ "what good thing shall I do, that I may
        have eternal life?" He answered, "If you will enter into life, keep the
        commandments" (Matthew 19:16, 17). It was because His people had failed
        to "keep the commandments" that the God-man Mediator was "made under the
        law," and obeyed it for them. And therefore its reward of "life" is due
        unto those whose Surety He was; yes, due unto Christ Himself to bestow
        upon them. Therefore did the Surety, when declaring "I have glorified
        You on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do"
        (John 17:4), remind the Father, "that He should give eternal life to as
        many as you have given him" (verse 2). But more, on the footing of
        justice, Christ demands that His people be taken to Heaven, saying,
        "Father, I will that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where
        I am" (John 17:24)—He claims eternal life for His people on the ground
        of His finished work, as the reward of His obedience. "Therefore as by
        the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so
        by the righteousness of One the free gift came upon all men unto
        justification of life" (Romans 5:18). The offence of the first Adam
        brought down the curse of the broken law upon the whole human race; but
        the satisfaction of the last Adam secured the blessing of the fulfilled
        law upon all those whom He represented. Judgment unto condemnation is a
        law term intending eternal death, the wages of sin; the "free gift"
        affirms that a gratuitous justification is bestowed upon all its
        recipients—"justification of life" being the issue of the gift, parallel
        with "shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ" (verse 17). The sentence
        of justification adjudges and entitles its object unto eternal life.
        Having now considered the two great blessings which come to the believer
        at his justification—deliverance from the curse of the law (death) and a
        title to the blessing of the law (life)—let us now seek to take a view
        of the originating source from which they proceed. This is the free,
        pure sovereign grace of God: as it is written "Being justified freely by
        His grace" (Romans 3:24). What is grace? It is God's unmerited and
        uninfluenced favor, shown unto the undeserving and Hell-deserving:
        neither human worthiness, works or willingness, attracting it, nor the
        lack of them repelling or obstructing it. What could there be in me to
        win the favorable regard of Him who is of too pure eyes to behold evil,
        and move Him to justify me? Nothing whatever; nay, there was everything
        in me calculated to make Him abhor and destroy me—my very self-righteous
        efforts to earn a place in Heaven deserving only a lower place in Hell.
        If, then, I am ever to be "justified" by God it must be by pure grace,
        and that alone. Grace is the very essence of the gospel—the only hope
        for fallen men, the sole comfort of saints passing through much
        tribulation on their way to the kingdom of God. The gospel is the
        announcement that God is prepared to deal with guilty rebels on the
        ground of free favor, of pure benignity; that God will blot out sin,
        cover the believing sinner with a robe of spotless righteousness, and
        receive him as an accepted son: not on account of anything he has done
        or ever will do, but of sovereign mercy, acting independently of the
        sinner's own character and deservings of eternal punishment.
        Justification is perfectly gratuitous so far as we are concerned,
        nothing being required of us in order to possess it, either in the way
        of price and satisfaction or preparation and fitness. We have not the
        slightest degree of merit to offer as the ground of our acceptance, and
        therefore if God ever does accept us it must be out of unmingled grace.
        It is as "the God of all grace" (1 Peter 5:10) that Jehovah justifies
        the ungodly. It is as "the God of all grace" He seeks, finds, and saves
        His people: asking them for nothing, giving them everything. Strikingly
        is this brought out in that word "being justified freely by His grace"
        (Romans 3:24), the design of that adverb being to exclude all
        consideration of anything in us or from us which should be the cause or
        condition of our justification. That same Greek adverb is translated
        "without a cause" in John 15:25—"they hated Me without a cause." The
        world's hatred of Christ was "without a cause" so far as He was
        concerned: there was nothing whatever in Him which, to the slightest
        degree, deserved their enmity against Him: there was nothing in Him
        unjust, perverse, or evil; instead, there was everything in Him which
        was pure, holy, lovely. In like manner, there is nothing whatever in us
        to call forth the approbation of God: by nature there is "no good thing"
        in us; but instead, everything that is evil, vile, loathsome. "Being
        justified without a cause by His GRACE." How this tells out the very
        heart of God! While there was no motive to move Him, outside of Himself,
        there was one inside Himself; while there was nothing in us to impel God
        to justify us, His own grace moved Him, so that He devised a way whereby
        His wondrous love could have vent and flow forth to the chief of
        sinners, the vilest of rebels. As it is written, "I, even I, am He who
        blots out your transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember
        your sins" (Isaiah 43:25). Wondrous, matchless grace! We cannot for a
        moment look outside the grace of God for any motive or reason why He
        should ever have noticed us, still less had respect unto such ungodly
        wretches. The first moving cause, then, that inclined God to show mercy
        to His people in their undone and lost condition, was His own wondrous
        grace—unsought, uninfluenced, unmerited by us. He might justly have left
        us all obnoxious to the curse of His law, without providing any Surety
        for us, as He did the fallen angels; but such was His grace toward us
        that "He spared not His own Son." "Not by works of righteousness which
        we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit; Which He shed on us
        abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior; That being justified by His
        grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life"
        (Titus 3:5-7). It was His own sovereign favor and good will which
        actuated God to form this wondrous scheme and method of justification.
        Against what has been said above, it has been objected by Socinians and
        their echoists that this cannot be: if the believing sinner is justified
        upon the grounds of a full satisfaction having been made to God for him
        by a surety, then his discharge from condemnation and his reception into
        God's judicial favor must be an act of pure justice, and therefore could
        not be by grace. Or, if it be purely an act of divine grace, then no
        surety can have obeyed the law in the believer's stead. But this is to
        confound two distinct things: the relation of God to Christ the Surety,
        and the relation of God to me the sinner. It was grace which transferred
        my sins to Christ; it was justice which smote Christ on account of those
        sins. It was grace which appointed me unto everlasting bliss; it is
        justice to Christ which requires I shall enjoy that which He purchased
        for me. Toward the sinner justification is an act of free unmerited
        favor; but toward Christ, as a sinner's Surety, it is an act of justice
        that eternal life should be bestowed upon those for whom His meritorious
        satisfaction was made. First, it was pure grace that God was willing to
        accept satisfaction from the hands of a surety. He might have exacted
        the debt from us in our own persons, and then our condition had been
        equally miserable as that of the fallen angels, for whom no mediator was
        provided. Second, it was wondrous grace that God Himself provided a
        Surety for us, which we could not have done. The only creatures who are
        capable of performing perfect obedience are the holy angels, yet none of
        them could have assumed and met our obligations, for they are not akin
        to us, possessing not human nature, and therefore incapable of dying.
        Even had an angel became incarnate, his obedience to the law could not
        have availed for the whole of God's elect, for it would not have
        possessed infinite value. None but a divine person taking human nature
        into union with Himself could present unto God a satisfaction adequate
        for the redemption of His people. And it was impossible for men to have
        found out that Mediator and Surety: it must have its first rise in God,
        and not from us: it was He who "found" a ransom (Job 33:24) and laid
        help upon One that is "mighty" (Psalm 89:19). In the last place, it was
        amazing grace that the Son was willing to perform such a work for us,
        without whose consent the justice of God could not have exacted the debt
        from Him. And His grace is the most eminent in that He knew beforehand
        all the unspeakable humiliation and unparalleled suffering which He
        would encounter in the discharge of this work, yet that did not deter
        Him; nor was He unapprized of the character of those for whom He did
        it—the guilty, the ungodly, the Hell-deserving; yet He shrank not back.
        "O to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be! Let Your
        grace, Lord, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee."
