        <h2>Its Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          In Romans 3:28 the Apostle Paul declared &quot;that a man is justified
          by faith without the deeds of the law,&quot; and then produces the
          case of Abraham to prove his assertion. But the Apostle James, from
          the case of the same Abraham, draws quite another conclusion, saying,
          &quot;You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
          faith only&quot; (James 2:24). This is one of the &quot;contradictions
          in the Bible&quot; to which infidels appeal in support of their
          unbelief. But the Christian, however difficult he finds it to
          harmonize passages apparently opposite, knows there cannot be any
          contradiction in the Word of God. Faith has unshaken confidence in the
          inerrancy of Holy Writ. Faith is humble too and prays, &quot;That
          which I see not teach You me&quot; (Job. 34:32). Nor is faith lazy; it
          prompts its possessor unto a reverent examination and diligent
          investigation of that which puzzles and perplexes, seeking to discover
          the subject of each separate book, the scope of each writer, the
          connections of each passage. Now the design of the Apostle Paul in
          Romans 3:28 may be clearly perceived from its context. He is treating
          of the great matter of a sinner&#x27;s justification before God: he
          shows that it cannot be by works of the law, because by the law all
          men are condemned, and also because if men were justified on the
          ground of their own doings, then boasting could not be excluded.
          Positively he affirms that justification is by grace, through the
          redemption that is in Christ Jesus. His reasoning will appear the more
          conclusive if the whole passage (Romans 3:19-28) be read attentively.
          Because the Jews had a high regard of Abraham, the apostle proceeded
          to show in the 4th chapter of Romans that Abraham was justified in
          that very way—apart from any works of his own, by faith alone. By such
          a method of justification the pride of the creature is strained, and
          the grace of God is magnified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the scope of the Apostle James is very different: his Epistle was
          written to counteract quite another error. Fallen men are creatures of
          extremes: no sooner are they driven out of the false refuge of
          trusting to their own righteousness, than they fly to the opposite and
          no less dangerous error of supposing that, since they cannot be
          justified by their own works, that there is no necessity whatever for
          good works, and no danger from ungodly living and unholy practice. It
          is very clear from the New Testament itself that very soon after the
          gospel was freely proclaimed, there arose many who turned the grace of
          God into &quot;lasciviousness&quot;: that this was not only quickly
          espoused in theory, but soon had free course in practice. It was
          therefore the chief design of the Apostle James to show the great
          wickedness and awful danger of unholy practice and to assert the
          imperative necessity of good works. The Apostle James devoted much of
          his Epistle to the exposing of any empty profession. In his second
          chapter, particularly, he addresses himself unto those who rested in a
          notion which they called &quot;faith,&quot; accounting an intellectual
          assent to the truth of the gospel sufficient for their salvation,
          though it had no spiritual influence upon their hearts, tempers, or
          conduct. The apostle shows their hope was a vain one, and that their
          &quot;faith&quot; was not a whit superior to that possessed by the
          demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the example of Abraham he proves that justifying faith is a very
          different thing from the &quot;faith&quot; of empty professors,
          because it enabled him to perform the hardest and most painful act of
          obedience, even the offering up of his only son upon the altar; which
          act took place many years after he had been justified by God, and
          which act manifested the reality and nature of his faith. From what
          has been said above, it should be very evident that the
          &quot;justification&quot; of which Paul treats is entirely different
          from the &quot;justification&quot; with which James deals. The
          doctrine of the former is that nothing renders any sinner acceptable
          to God but faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; the doctrine of the latter
          is that such a faith is not solitary, but accompanied with every good
          work, and that where good works are absent, justifying faith cannot
          exist. James is insistent that it is not enough to say I have
          justifying faith, I must give proof of the same by exhibiting those
          fruits which love toward God and love toward men necessarily produce.
          Paul writes of our justification before God, James of our
          justification before men. Paul treats of the justification of persons;
          James, of the justification of our profession. The one is by faith
          alone; the other is by a faith which works by love and produces
          obedience. Now it is of first importance that the above-mentioned
          distinctions should be clearly grasped. When Christian theologians
          affirm that the sinner is justified by faith alone, they do not mean
          that faith exists alone in the person justified, for justifying faith
          is always accompanied by all the other graces which the Spirit imparts
          at our regeneration; nor do they mean that nothing else is required in
          order to our receiving forgiveness from God, for He requires
          repentance and conversion as well as faith (Acts 3:19). No, rather do
          they mean that there is nothing else in sinners themselves to which
          their justification is in Scripture ascribed: nothing else is required
          of them or exists in them which stands in the same relation to
          justification as their faith does, or which exerts any casual
          influence or any efficacy of instrumentality in producing the result
          of their being justified (Condensed from Cunningham).
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, that faith which justifies is not an idle and
          inoperative principle, but one that purifies the heart (Acts 15:9) and
          works by love (Galatians 5:6). It is faith which can easily be
          distinguished from that mental faith of the empty professor. It is
          this which the Apostle James insists so emphatically upon. The subject
          of this Epistle is not salvation by grace and justification by faith,
          but the testing of those who claim to have faith. His design is not to
          show the ground on which sinners are accepted before God, but to make
          known that which evidences a sinner&#x27;s having been justified. He
          insists that the tree is known by its fruits, that a righteous person
          is one who walks in the paths of righteousness. He declares that the
          man who is not a doer of the Word, but a &quot;hearer only,&quot; is
          self-deceived, deluded. When God justifies a man, He sanctifies him
          too: the two blessings are inseparable, never found apart. Unless the
          subject and scope of James&#x27; Epistle be clearly seen, the
          apprehension of many of its statements can only issue in
          God-dishonoring, grace-repudiating, soul-destroying error. To this
          portion of the Word of God, more than any other, have legalists
          appealed in their opposition to the grand truth of justification by
          grace, through faith, without works.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the declarations of this Epistle have they turned to find support
          for their Christ-insulting, man-exalting, gospel-repudiating error of
          justification by human works. Merit-mongers of all descriptions cite
          James 2 for the purpose of setting aside all that is taught elsewhere
          in Scripture on the subject of justification. Romanists, and their
          half-brothers the Arminians, quote &quot;You see then how that by
          works a man is justified, and not by faith only&quot; (verse 24), and
          suppose that ends all argument. We propose now to take up James
          2:14-26 and offer a few comments thereon. &quot;What does it profit,
          my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? Can
          faith save him?&quot; (verse 14). Observe carefully that the apostle
          does not here ask, &quot;What does it profit a man though he has faith
          and have not works?&quot;—such a supposition is nowhere countenanced
          by the Word of God: it were to suppose the impossibility for wherever
          real faith exists, good works necessarily follow. No, instead he asks,
          &quot;What does it profit, my brethren, though a man (not &quot;one of
          you&quot;!) say he has faith&quot;? Professing to be a Christian when
          a man is not one, may secure a standing among men, improve his moral
          and social prestige, obtain membership in a &quot;church,&quot; and
          promote his commercial interests; but can it save his soul? It is not
          that those empty professors who call themselves Christians are all
          (though many probably are) conscious hypocrites, rather are they
          deceived souls, and the tragic thing is that in most places there is
          nothing in the preaching which is at all calculated to un-deceive
          them; instead, there is only that which bolsters them up in their
          delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a large class in Christendom today who are satisfied with a
          bare profession. They have heard expounded some of the fundamentals of
          the Christian faith, and have given an intellectual assent thereto,
          and they mistake that for a saving knowledge of the Truth. Their minds
          are instructed, but their hearts are not reached, nor their lives
          transformed. They are still worldly in their affections and ways.
          There is no real subjection to God, no holiness of walk, no fruit to
          Christ&#x27;s glory. Their &quot;faith&quot; is of no value at all;
          their profession is vain. &quot;What does it profit, my brethren,
          though a man say he has faith, and have not works? Can faith save
          him?&quot; By noting the emphasis upon the word &quot;say,&quot; we
          perceive at once that James is arguing against those who substituted a
          theoretical belief of the gospel for the whole of evangelical
          religion, and who replied to all exhortations and reproofs by saying,
          &quot;We are not justified by our works, but by faith alone.&quot; He
          therefore begins by asking what profit is there in professing to be a
          believer, when a man is devoid of true piety? The answer is, none
          whatever. To merely say I have faith when I am unable to appeal to any
          good works and spiritual fruits as the evidence of it, profits neither
          the speaker nor those who listen to his empty talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ability to prate in an orthodox manner about the doctrines of
          Christianity is a vastly different thing from justifying faith.
          &quot;If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
          And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and
          filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are
          needful to the body; what does it profit?&quot; (verses 15, 16). Here
          the apostle shows by an opposite illustration the utter worthlessness
          of fair talking which is unaccompanied by practical deeds: notice the
          &quot;say unto them, depart in peace&quot; etc. What is the use and
          value of feigning to be charitable when the works of charity are
          withheld? None whatever: empty bellies are not filled by benevolent
          words, nor are naked backs clothed by good wishes. Nor is the soul
          saved by a bare profession of the gospel. &quot;Faith works by
          love&quot; (Galatians 5:6). The first &quot;fruit of the spirit,&quot;
          that is of the new nature in the regenerated soul, is &quot;love&quot;
          (Galatians 5:22). When faith has truly been wrought in the heart by
          the Holy Spirit, that faith is manifested in love—love toward God,
          love toward His commandments (John 14:23), love toward the brethren,
          love toward our fellow-creatures. Therefore in testing the
          &quot;faith&quot; of the empty professor, the apostle at once puts to
          the proof his love. In showing the pretense of his love, he proves the
          worthlessness of his &quot;faith.&quot; &quot;But whoever has this
          world&#x27;s good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his
          affections of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in
          him?&quot; (1 John 3:17)! Genuine love is operative; so is genuine
          faith. &quot;Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being
          alone&quot; (James 2:17). Here the apostle applies the illustration he
          has employed to the case before him, proving the worthlessness of a
          lifeless and inoperative &quot;faith.&quot; Even our fellow-men would
          promptly denounce as valueless a &quot;love&quot; which was gushing in
          words but lacking in works. Unregenerate people are not deceived by
          those who talk benignly to the indigent, but who refuse to minister
          unto their needs. And think you, my reader, that the omniscient God is
          to be imposed upon by an empty profession? Has He not said, &quot;Why
          call you Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?&quot;
          (Luke 6:46). That &quot;faith&quot; which is only of the lips and is
          not confirmed by evidence in the life, is useless. No matter how clear
          and sound may be my head-knowledge of the Truth, no matter how good a
          talker upon divine things I am, if my walk is not controlled by the
          precepts of God, then I am but &quot;sounding brass and a tinkling
          symbol.&quot; &quot;Faith, if it has not works, is dead, being
          alone.&quot; It is not a living and fruitful faith, like the faith of
          God&#x27;s elect, but a thing which is utterly worthless—
          &quot;dead.&quot; It is &quot;alone,&quot; that is, divorced from love
          to God and men and every holy affection. How could our holy Lord
          approve of such a &quot;faith&quot;! As works without faith are
          &quot;dead&quot; (Hebrews 9:14), so a &quot;faith&quot; which is
          without &quot;works&quot; is a dead one. &quot;Yes, a man may say, You
          have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works,
          and I will show you my faith by my works&quot; (James 2:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the true Christian challenges the empty professor: You claim to
          be a believer, but disgrace the name of Christ by your worldly walk,
          so do not expect the real saints to regard you as a brother until you
          display your faith in the good works of a holy life. The emphatic word
          in this verse is &quot;show&quot;—proof is demanded: demonstrate your
          faith to be genuine. Actions speak louder than words: unless our
          profession can endure that test it is worthless. Only true holiness of
          heart and life vindicates a profession of being justified by faith.
          &quot;You Believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also
          believe, and tremble&quot; (verse 19). Here the apostle anticipates an
          objection: I do actually believe in the Lord! Very well, so also do
          the demons, but what is the fruit of their &quot;believing&quot;? Does
          it influence their hearts and lives, does it transform their conduct
          Godward and manward? It does not. Then what is their
          &quot;believing&quot; worth! &quot;But will you know, O vain man, that
          faith without works is dead?&quot; (verse 20): &quot;vain&quot;
          signifies &quot;empty,&quot; exposing the hollowness of one who claims
          to be justified by faith yet lacks the evidence of an obedient walk.
          &quot;Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
          offered Isaac his son upon the altar? See you how faith wrought with
          his works, and by works was faith made perfect?&quot; (verses 21, 22).
          The faith which reposes on Christ is not an idle, but an active and
          fruitful principle. Abraham had been justified many years before
          (Genesis 15:6); the offering up of Isaac (Genesis 22) was the open
          attestation of his faith and the manifestation of the sincerity of his
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;By works was faith made perfect&quot; means, in actual obedience
          it reaches its designed end, the purpose for which it was given is
          realized. &quot;Made perfect&quot; also signifies revealed or made
          known (see 2 Corinthians 10:9). &quot;And the Scripture was fulfilled
          which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
          righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God&quot; (James 2:23).
          The &quot;scripture&quot; here is God&#x27;s testimony to Abraham in
          Genesis 15:6: that testimony was &quot;fulfilled&quot; or verified
          when Abraham gave the supreme demonstration of his obedience to God.
          Our being informed here that Abraham was &quot;called the Friend of
          God&quot; is in beautiful accord with the tenor of the whole of this
          passage, as is clear from a comparison with John 15:14: &quot;You are
          my friends, if you do whatever I command you.&quot; &quot;You see then
          how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only&quot;
          (James 2:24). In the &quot;you see then&quot; the apostle draws his
          &quot;conclusion&quot; from the foregoing. It is by &quot;works,&quot;
          by acts of implicit obedience to the divine command, such as Abraham
          exercised—and not by a mere &quot;faith&quot; of the brain and the
          lips—that we justify our profession of being believers, that we prove
          our right to be regarded as Christians. &quot;Likewise also was not
          Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the
          messengers, and had sent them out another way?&quot; (verse 25). Why
          bring in the case of Rahab? Was not the example of Abraham conclusive
          and sufficient? First, because &quot;two witnesses&quot; are required
          for the truth to be &quot;established&quot;—cf. Romans 4:3, 6. Second,
          because, it might be objected Abraham&#x27;s case was so exceptional
          that it could be no criterion to measure others by. Very well: Rahab
          was a poor Gentile, a heathen, a harlot; yet she too was justified by
          faith (Hebrews 11:31), and later demonstrated her faith by
          &quot;works&quot;—receiving the spies at the imminent risk of her own
          life. &quot;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith
          without works is dead also&quot; (James 2:26).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the summing up: a breathless carcass and a worthless faith are
          alike useless as unto all the ends of natural and spiritual life. Thus
          the apostle has conclusively shown the worthlessness of the garb of
          orthodoxy when worn by lifeless professors. He has fully exposed the
          error of those who rest in a bare profession of the gospel—as if that
          could save them, when the temper of their minds and the tenor of their
          lives was diametrically opposed to the holy religion they professed. A
          holy heart and an obedient walk are the scriptural evidence of our
          having been justified by God.
