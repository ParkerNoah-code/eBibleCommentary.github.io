        <h2>Atonement</h2>
        <p>
          J. I. Packer, Concise Theology: A Guide to Historic Christian Beliefs
          (Wheaton: Tyndale, 1993), 134: "<em>Atonement</em> means making
          amends, blotting out the offense, and giving satisfaction for wrong
          done; thus reconciling to oneself the alienated other and restoring
          the disrupted relationship."

        <p>
          John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian
          Belief (Phillipsburg: P&R, 2013), 901: "Jesus’ atoning sacrifice
          fulfills the OT sacrifices of bulls, goats, lambs, doves, flour, wine,
          and oil. In the OT, God used those sacrifices to teach the people what
          Jesus was later going to do. So we can learn from those sacrifices
          about the meaning of Jesus’ atonement."

          1. The atonement is grounded in the holiness of God who, being
          perfectly holy, hates and punishes sin.<br />
          2. A penalty for sin must be paid.<br />
          3. People cannot pay the penalty for their sins and live; rather, the
          penalty is death.<br />
          4. Only God can pay the penalty for sin, but he must partake of human
          nature to pay for human beings.<br />
          5. By his death, the God-man, Jesus Christ, atoned for human sin.<br />
          6. The atonement had to be accomplished in this way (“penal
          substitution theory”).

          >: "In the simplest possible terms, the biblical doctrine of penal
          substitution holds that Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross takes the place
          of the punishment we ought to suffer for our sins. As a result, God’s
          justice is satisfied, and those who accept Christ can be forgiven and
          reconciled to God."

          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 49: "God is a good
          King who loves his creation and is, therefore, opposed to that which
          violates its goodness. Because of his love (not in spite of it), God
          responds to sin... God’s response to sin, therefore, is judgment (2
          Cor. 5:10), punishment (2 Thess. 1:9), wrath (John 3:36), a curse
          (Deut. 11:28), exile (2 Kings 17:6–7), and ultimately death (Rom.
          6:23). This is the penalty of sin."

          his righteousness reacting against unrighteousness; it shows itself in
          retributive justice. But Jesus Christ has shielded us from the
          nightmare prospect of retributive justice by becoming our
          representative substitute, in obedience to his Father’s will, and
          receiving the wages of our sin in our place."

          specifically to endure its penal consequences, to undergo its
          penalty... The sinless one was 'made sin for us,' which must mean that
          he bore the penalty of our sin instead of us, and he redeemed us from
          the law’s curse by 'becoming a curse for us,' which must mean that the

          <em>taking the consequences of our sins</em>. The biblical assumption
          is that death is the consequence of sin, and therefore Christ takes
          that consequence even though the sin is not his own. In his death,

          as we hinted earlier, is a word pointing to the violent death
          inflicted in the animal sacrifices of the old covenant... Along with
          the other New Testament writers, Paul always points to the death of
          Jesus as the atoning event and explains the atonement in terms of
          <em>representative substitution</em>—the innocent taking place of the
          guilty, in the name and for the sake of the guilty, under the axe of
          God’s judicial retribution."

          John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian
          Belief (Phillipsburg: P&R, 2013), 904: "First, Scripture teaches that
          sacrifice is required to receive God’s forgiveness: without the
          shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). As we
          have seen, the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23; cf. Ezek. 18:4).
          Second, on this view, God demonstrates the severity of his law by
          putting to death an innocent man. But unless Jesus is a substitute for
          us, his death is a demonstration of injustice, not justice."

          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 68.
          Stott offers a fourfold theory to explain the cross. He argues that it
          comes from the gospel itself and that the cross remains unintelligible
          without it: "that Christ died for us, for our good; that the 'good' he
          died to procure for us was our salvation; that in order to procure it
          he had to deal with our sins; and that in dying for them it was our
          death that he died."

          sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) and offered Himself as a sacrifice to
          God the Father (Eph. 5:2; Heb. 9:14) so that we might be justified by

          penalty for the sins of all men, it would appear that at the day of
          judgment there will remain nothing to be punished, and consequently

          came to an end by the violent rending of His flesh; and that, as
          though He Himself were a sinner, He died the sinner's kind of death
          (i.e., a blood-shedding death); and it is because He died the kind of
          death that sinners ought to die, that sinners can by faith in Him and
          Him crucified be saved from sin and all its dire consequences."

            trespasses, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was
            against us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.
            Having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of
            them openly, triumphing over them in it" (Col 2:13-15).

          >, TMSJ 20/2 (Fall 2009) 199-214: "The evidence showing that the early
          church believed and taught penal substitution is impressive and as
          Jeffery, Ovey, and Sach have put it, 'quite overwhelming.' Those who
          hold to the doctrine of penal substitution can be encouraged that
          their belief has been clearly articulated throughout church history."

            >Calvin’s Multi-Faceted Atonement</a
          >: "Of course, Calvin clearly taught a legal theme in Christ’s work of
          atonement. In ourselves, we stand condemned before the bar of God’s
          justice, under the curse, and liable to God’s just wrath. Christ,
          though, obeyed and fulfilled the law, stood under no curse himself,
          but on our behalf suffered judgment that we might go free."

          >: "By defeating the evil powers that oppose God, Jesus Christ rescued
          his people from Satan and established himself as the rightful king of
          the cosmos. This view is not exclusive to the penal substitutionary
          view, as can be seen by the presence of both in the writings of
          figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin."
