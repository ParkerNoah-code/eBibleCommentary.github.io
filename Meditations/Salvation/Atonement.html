        <h2>Penalty</h2>
        <p>
          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 49: "God is a good
          King who loves his creation and is, therefore, opposed to that which
          violates its goodness. Because of his love (not in spite of it), God
          responds to sin... God’s response to sin, therefore, is judgment (2
          Cor. 5:10), punishment (2 Thess. 1:9), wrath (John 3:36), a curse
          (Deut. 11:28), exile (2 Kings 17:6–7), and ultimately death (Rom.
          6:23). This is the penalty of sin."
        </p>

        <h2>Substitution</h2>
        <p>
          "Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
          unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the
          flesh, but made alive in the Spirit" (1 Pet 3:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 39: "He took what
          was ours because of sin and gave us what is his by grace. Jesus lived
          the life we could not live, died the death we should have died, and
          rose so that we can have life in him. The King became a servant to
          bring us into his kingdom. And it all hinges on substitution."
        </p>
        <p>
          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Books, 2006),
          68. Stott offers a fourfold theory to explain the cross which he
          argues comes from the Bible itself and without which the gospel
          remains unintelligible: "that Christ died for us, for our good; that
          the 'good' he died to procure for us was our salvation; that in order
          to procure it he had to deal with our sins; and that in dying for them
          it was our death that he died."

        <h1>Scripture</h1>
        <h2>Body</h2>
        <p>
          "you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that
          you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead,
          that we might produce fruit to God" (Rom 7:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          "he has reconciled [you] in the body of his flesh through death, to
          present you holy and without defect and blameless before him" (Col
          1:22).
        </p>
        <p>
          "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus
          Christ once for all" (Heb 10:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having
          died to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed by his
          wounds" (1 Pet 2:24).
        </p>

        <h2>Blood</h2>
        <p>
          "Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in which
          the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of
          the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
          Christ Jesus, whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice through faith
          in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the
          passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance" (Rom 3:24-25).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved
          from God’s wrath through him" (Rom 5:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          "In him we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
          our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace" (Eph 1:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          "you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the
          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the
          promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in
          Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of
          Christ." (Eph 2:12-13).
        </p>
        <p>
          "For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him, and through him to
          reconcile all things to himself by him, whether things on the earth or
          things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his
          cross." (Col 1:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          "But Christ having come as a high priest... through his own blood,
          entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal
          redemption." (Heb 9:11-12).
        </p>
        <p>
          "how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
          Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience
          from dead works to serve the living God?" (Heb 9:14).
        </p>
        <p>
          "that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood" (1
          Pet 1:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          "knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things like
          silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your
          fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish or
          spot, the blood of Christ" (1 Pet 1:18-19).
        </p>
        <p>
          "But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship
          with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us
          from all sin" (1 Jn 1:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and
          the ruler of the kings of the earth... who loves us, and washed us
          from our sins by his blood" (Rev 1:4-5).
        </p>
        <p>
          "They sang a new song, saying, 'You are worthy to take the book and to
          open its seals, for you were killed, and bought us for God with your
          blood out of every tribe, language, people, and nation, and made us
          kings and priests to our God; and we will reign on the earth.'" (Rev
          5:9-10).
