        <h2>Penalty</h2>
        <p>
          "For the life of the flesh is in the blood. I have given it to you on
          the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that
          makes atonement by reason of the life" (Lev 17:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 49: "God is a good
          King who loves his creation and is, therefore, opposed to that which
          violates its goodness. Because of his love (not in spite of it), God
          responds to sin... God’s response to sin, therefore, is judgment (2
          Cor. 5:10), punishment (2 Thess. 1:9), wrath (John 3:36), a curse
          (Deut. 11:28), exile (2 Kings 17:6–7), and ultimately death (Rom.
          6:23). This is the penalty of sin."

          J. I. Packer, In My Place Condemned He Stood: Celebrating the Glory of
          the Atonement (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2007), 40–41: "God’s wrath is
          his righteousness reacting against unrighteousness; it shows itself in
          retributive justice. But Jesus Christ has shielded us from the
          nightmare prospect of retributive justice by becoming our
          representative substitute, in obedience to his Father’s will, and
          receiving the wages of our sin in our place."

          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 143,
          148: "It is clear from Old Testament usage that to 'bear sin' means...
          specifically to endure its penal consequences, to undergo its
          penalty... The sinless one was 'made sin for us,' which must mean that
          he bore the penalty of our sin instead of us, and he redeemed us from
          the law’s curse by 'becoming a curse for us,' which must mean that the
          curse of the law lying upon us for our disobedience was transferred to
          him, so that he bore it instead of us."

            >Penal Substitution: A Response to Recent Criticisms</a
          >, JETS 50/1 (March 2007) 71-86: "To state what ought to be obvious:
          he punished the sin that had been transferred to Christ, not Christ
          regarded in and of himself, with whom in this very act he was well
          pleased."

            >The Cross and Substitutionary Atonement</a
          >, SBJT 11/2 (Summer 2007) 64-73: "Statements about Christ’s death
          <em>for our sins</em>, on the other hand, mean
          <em>taking the consequences of our sins</em>. The biblical assumption
          is that death is the consequence of sin, and therefore Christ takes
          that consequence even though the sin is not his own. In his death,
          Christ receives the penalty that was due to us."
        </p>

        <h2>Substitution</h2>
        <p>
          "Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
          unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the
          flesh, but made alive in the Spirit" (1 Pet 3:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
          Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 39: "He took what
          was ours because of sin and gave us what is his by grace. Jesus lived
          the life we could not live, died the death we should have died, and
          rose so that we can have life in him. The King became a servant to
          bring us into his kingdom. And it all hinges on substitution."
        </p>
        <p>
          John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 68. To
          explain the cross Stott offers a fourfold theory which he argues from
          the Bible itself and without which the gospel remains unintelligible:
          "that Christ died for us, for our good; that the 'good' he died to
          procure for us was our salvation; that in order to procure it he had
          to deal with our sins; and that in dying for them it was our death
          that he died."
        </p>
        <p>
          J. I. Packer, In My Place Condemned He Stood: Celebrating the Glory of
          the Atonement (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2007), 37-38: "<em>Blood</em>,
          as we hinted earlier, is a word pointing to the violent death
          inflicted in the animal sacrifices of the old covenant... Along with
          the other New Testament writers, Paul always points to the death of
          Jesus as the atoning event and explains the atonement in terms of
          <em>representative substitution</em>—the innocent taking place of the
          guilty, in the name and for the sake of the guilty, under the axe of
          God’s judicial retribution."

        <p>
          "you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that
          you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead,
          that we might produce fruit to God" (Rom 7:4).

          "he has reconciled [you] in the body of his flesh through death, to
          present you holy and without defect and blameless before him" (Col

          "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
          Christ Jesus, whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice through faith
          in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the
          passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance" (Rom 3:24-25).
        </p>

        <p>
          "you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the
          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the
          promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in
          Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of
          Christ." (Eph 2:12-13).

          "But Christ having come as a high priest... through his own blood,
          entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal
          redemption." (Heb 9:11-12).

          "knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things like
          silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your
          fathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish or
          spot, the blood of Christ" (1 Pet 1:18-19).

            >The Meaning of the Word 'Blood' In Scripture</a
          >, (London: Tyndale, 1948): "To speak, therefore, of Christ's shed
          blood is to acknowledge the amazing fact that He, the sinless Son of
          God, actually as Man died the kind of death which only sinners ought
          to die. All our references to 'Christ's blood' ought therefore to
          involve the significant recollection that His human life in this world
          came to an end by the violent rending of His flesh; and that, as
          though He Himself were a sinner, He died the sinner's kind of death
          (i.e., a blood-shedding death); and it is because He died the kind of
          death that sinners ought to die, that sinners can by faith in Him and
          Him crucified be saved from sin and all its dire consequences"
        </p>

        <h2>Cross</h2>
        <p>
          "and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross,
          having killed the hostility through it" (Eph 2:16).

        <p>
          "and through him to reconcile all things to himself by him, whether
          things on the earth or things in the heavens, having made peace
          through the blood of his cross" (Col 1:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          "He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
          trespasses, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against
          us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. Having
          stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them
          openly, triumphing over them in it" (Col 2:13-15).
        </p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          "unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by
          itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit" (Jn 12:24).
        </p>
        <p>
          "For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the
          ungodly" (Rom 5:6).

        <p>
          "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet
          sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          "For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the
          death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his
          life" (Rom 5:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures" (1 Cor 15:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          "He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to
          themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again" (2 Cor
          5:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          "You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your
          evil deeds, yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through
          death, to present you holy and without defect and blameless before
          him" (Col 1:21-22)
        </p>
        <p>
          "For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation
          through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake
          or sleep, we should live together with him" (1 Thes 5:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          "But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels,
          Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor,
          that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone" (Heb
          2:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also
          himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he
          might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the
          devil, and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were
          all their lifetime subject to bondage" (Heb 2:14-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          "For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death
          has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under
          the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the
          promise of the eternal inheritance" (Heb 9:15).
