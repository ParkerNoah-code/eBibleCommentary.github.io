        <h2>Its Problem</h2>
        <p>
          In this and the following chapter our aim will be fourfold. First, to
          demonstrate the impossibility of any sinner obtaining acceptance and
          favor with God on the ground of his own performances. Second, to show
          that the saving of a sinner presented a problem which nothing but
          omniscience could solve, but that the consummate wisdom of God has
          devised a way whereby He can pronounce righteous a guilty transgressor
          of His law without impeaching His veracity, sullying His holiness, or
          ignoring the claims of justice; yes, in such a way that all His
        </p>
        <p>
          perfections have been displayed and magnified, and the Son of His love
          glorified. Third, point out the sole ground on which an awakened
          conscience can find solid and stable peace. Fourth, seek to give
          God&#x27;s children a clearer understanding of the exceeding riches of
          divine grace, that their hearts may be drawn out in fervent praise
          unto the Author of &quot;so great salvation.&quot; But let it be
          pointed out at the onset that, any reader who has never seen himself
          under the white light of God&#x27;s holiness, and who has never felt
          His Word cutting him to the very quick, will be unable to fully enter
          into the force of what we are about to write. Yes, in all probability,
          he who is unregenerate is likely to take decided exception unto much
          of what will be said, denying that any such difficulty exists in the
          matter of a merciful God pardoning one of His offending creatures. Or,
          if he does not dissent to that extent, yet he will most likely
          consider that we have grossly exaggerated the various elements in the
          case we are about to present, that we have pictured the sinner&#x27;s
          condition in far darker hues than was warranted. This must be so, for
          he has no experimental acquaintance with God, nor is he conscious of
          the fearful plague of his own heart. The natural man cannot endure the
          thought of being thoroughly searched by God. The last thing he desires
          is to pass beneath the all-seeing eye of his Maker and Judge, so that
          his every thought and desire, his most secret imagination and motive,
          stands exposed before Him. It is indeed a most solemn experience when
          we are made to feel with the Psalmist, &quot;O LORD, You have searched
          me, and known me. You know my down sitting and mine uprising, You
          understand my thought afar off. You compass my path and my lying down,
          and are acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my
          tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it altogether. You have beset me
          behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me&quot; (Psalm 139:1-5).
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, dear reader, the very last thing which the natural man desires is
          to be searched, through and through by God, and have his real
          character exposed to view. But when God undertakes to do this very
          thing—which He either will do in grace in this life, or in judgment in
          the day to come—there is no escape for us. Then it is we may well
          exclaim, &quot;Where shall I go from Your Spirit? or where shall I
          flee from Your presence? If I ascend up into Heaven, You are there: if
          I make my bed in Hell, behold, you are there. If I take the wings of
          the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there
          shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. If I say,
          Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light
          about me&quot; (Psalm 139:7-11). Then it is we shall be assured,
          &quot;Yes, the darkness hides not from You; but the night shines as
          the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to You&quot; (verse
          12). Then it is that the soul is awakened to a realization of Who it
          is with whom it has to do. Then it is that he now perceives something
          of the high claims of God upon him, the just requirements of His law,
          the demands of His holiness. Then it is that he realizes how
          completely he has failed to consider those claims, how fearfully he
          has disregarded that law, how miserably he falls short of meeting
          those demands. Now it is that he perceives he has been &quot;a
          transgressor from the womb&quot; (Isaiah 48:8), that so far from
          having lived to glorify his Maker, he has done nothing but follow the
          course of this world and fulfill the lust of the flesh. Now it is he
          realizes that there is &quot;no soundness&quot; in him but, from the
          sole of the foot even unto the head, &quot;wounds, and bruises, and
          putrefying sores&quot; (Isaiah 1:6). Now it is he is made to see that
          all his righteousness are as &quot;filthy rags&quot; (Isaiah 64:6).
          &quot;It is easy for any one in the cloisters of the schools to
          indulge himself in idle speculations of the merit of works to justify
          men; but when he comes into the presence of God, he must bid farewell
          to these amusements, for there the business is transacted with
          seriousness, and no ludicrous logomachy practiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this point, then, must our attention be directed, if we wish to
          make any useful inquiry concerning true righteousness; how we can
          answer the celestial Judge, when He shall call us to an account. Let
          us place that Judge before our eyes, not according to the spontaneous
          imaginations of our minds, but according to the descriptions given of
          Him in the Scripture; which represents Him as one whose refulgence
          eclipses the stars, whose power melts the mountains, whose anger
          shakes the earth, whose wisdom takes the subtle in their own
          craftiness, whose purity makes all things appear polluted, whose
          righteousness even the angels are unable to bear, who acquits not the
          guilty, whose vengeance, when it is once kindled, penetrates even to
          the abyss of Hell&quot; (John Calvin). Ah, my reader, tremendous
          indeed are the effects produced in the soul when one is really brought
          into the presence of God, and is granted a sight of His awesome
          majesty. While we measure ourselves by our fellow men, it is easy to
          reach the conclusion that there is not much wrong with us; but when we
          approach the dread tribunal of ineffable holiness, we form an entirely
          different estimate of our character and conduct. While we are occupied
          with earthly objects we may pride ourselves in the strength of our
          seeing faculty, but fix the gaze steadily on the midday sun and under
          its dazzling brilliance the weakness of the eye will at once become
          apparent. In like manner, while I compare myself with other sinners I
          can but form a wrong estimate of myself, but if I gauge my life by the
          plummet of God&#x27;s law, and do so in the light of His holiness, I
          must &quot;Abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes&quot; (Job
          42:6). But not only has sin corrupted man&#x27;s being, it has changed
          his relation to God: it has &quot;alienated&quot; him (Ephesians
          4:18), and brought him under His righteous condemnation. Man has
          broken God&#x27;s law in thought and word and deed, not once, but
          times without number. By the divine tribunal he is pronounced an
          incorrigible transgressor, a guilty rebel. He is under the curse of
          his Maker. The law demands that its punishment shall be inflicted upon
          him; justice clamors for satisfaction. The sinner&#x27;s case is
          deplorable, then, to the last degree. When this is painfully felt by
          the convicted conscience, its agonized possessor cries out, &quot;How
          then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is
          born of a woman?&quot; (Job 25:4). How indeed! Let us now consider the
          various elements which enter into this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The requirements of God&#x27;s law. &quot;Every question therefore,
          respecting justification necessarily brings before us the judicial
          courts of God. The principles of those courts must be determined by
          God alone. Even to earthly governors we concede the right of
          establishing their own laws, and appointing the mode of their
          enforcement. Shall we then accord this title to man, and withhold it
          from the all-wise and almighty God? Surely no presumption can be
          greater than for the creature to sit in judgment on the Creator, and
          pretend to determine what should, or should not be, the methods of His
          government. It must be our place reverently to listen to His own
          exposition of the principles of His own courts, and humbly to thank
          Him for His goodness in condescending to explain to us what those
          principles are. As sinners, we can have no claim on God. We do have
          claim to a revelation that should acquaint us with His ways. &quot;The
          judicial principles of the government of God, are, as might be
          expected, based upon the absolute perfectness of His own holiness.
          This was fully shown both in the prohibitory and in the mandatory
          commandments of the law as given at Sinai. That law prohibited not
          only wrong deeds and wrong counsels of heart, but it went deeper
          still. It prohibited even wrong desires and wrong tendencies, saying,
          &#x27;you shall not be concupiscent&#x27;—that is, you shall not have,
          even momentarily, one desire or tendency that is contrary to the
          perfectness of God. And then as to its positive requirements, it
          demanded the perfect, unreserved, perpetual surrender of soul and
          body, with all its powers, to God and to His service. Not only was it
          required, that love to Him—love perfect and unremitted—should dwell as
          a living principle in the heart, but also that it should be developed
          in action, and that unvaryingly. The mode also of the development
          throughout, was required to be as perfect as the principle from which
          the development sprang. &quot;If any among the children of men be able
          to substantiate a claim to perfectness such as this, the Courts of God
          are ready to recognize it. The God of Truth will recognize a truthful
          claim wherever it is found. But if we are unable to present any such
          claim—if corruption be found in us and in our ways—if in anything we
          have fallen short of God&#x27;s glory, then it is obvious that however
          willing the Courts of God may be to recognize perfectness wherever it
          exists, such willingness can afford no ground of hope to those, who,
          instead of having perfectness, have sins and short-comings
          unnumbered&quot; (B.W. Newton).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The indictment preferred against us. &quot;Hear, O Heavens, and
          give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and
          brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knows
          his owner, and the donkey his master&#x27;s crib: but Israel does not
          know, My people does not consider. Ah sinful nation, a people laden
          with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they
          have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
          anger, they are gone away backward&quot; (Isaiah 1:2-4). The eternal
          God justly charges us with having broken all His commandments—some in
          act, some in word, all of them in thought and imagination. The
          enormity of this charge is heightened by the fact that against light
          and knowledge we chose the evil and forsook the good: that again and
          again we deliberately turned aside from God&#x27;s righteous law, and
          went astray like lost sheep, following the evil desires and devices of
          our own hearts. Above, we find God complaining that inasmuch as we are
          his creatures, we ought to have obeyed Him, that inasmuch as we owe
          our very lives to His daily care we ought to have rendered Him fealty
          instead of disobedience, and have been His loyal subjects instead of
          turning traitors to His throne. No exaggeration of sin is brought
          against us, but a statement of fact is declared which it is impossible
          for us to gainsay. We are ungrateful, unruly, ungodly creatures. Who
          would keep a horse that refused to work? Who would retain a dog which
          barked and flew at us? Yet we have broken God&#x27;s sabbaths,
          despised His reproofs, abused His mercies.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The sentence of the law. This is clearly announced in the divine
          oracles, &quot;Cursed is every one that continues not in all things
          which are written in the book of the law to do them&quot; (Galatians
          3:10). Whoever violates a single precept of the divine law exposes
          himself to the displeasure of God, and to punishment as the expression
          of that displeasure. No allowance is made for ignorance, no
          distinction is made between persons, no relaxation of its strictness
          is permissible: &quot;The soul that sins it shall die&quot; is its
          inexorable pronouncement. No exception is made whether the
          transgressor be young or old, rich or poor, Jew or Gentile: &quot;the
          wages of sin is death&quot;; for &quot;the wrath of God is revealed
          from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men&quot;
          (Romans 1:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Judge Himself is inflexibly just. In the high court of divine
          justice God takes the law in its strictest and sternest aspect, and
          judges rigidly according to the letter. &quot;But we are sure that the
          judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such
          things... Who will render to every man according to his deeds&quot;
          (Romans 2:2, 6). God is inexorably righteous, and will not show any
          partiality either to the law or to its transgressor. The Most High has
          determined that His holy law shall be faithfully upheld and its
          sanctions strictly enforced. What would this country be like if all
          its judges ceased to uphold and enforce the laws of the land? What
          conditions would prevail were sentimental mercy to reign at the
          expense of righteousness? Now God is the Judge of all the earth and
          the moral Ruler of the universe. Holy Writ declares that &quot;justice
          and judgment,&quot; and not pity and clemency, are the
          &quot;habitation&quot; of His &quot;throne&quot; (Psalm 89:14).
          God&#x27;s attributes do not conflict with each other. His mercy does
          not override His justice, nor is His grace ever shown at the expense
          of righteousness. Each of His perfections is given free course. For
          God to give a sinner entrance into Heaven simply because He loved him,
          would be like a judge sheltering an escaped convict in his own home
          merely because he pitied him. Scripture emphatically declares that
          God, &quot;will by no means clear the guilty&quot; (Exodus 34:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The sinner is unquestionably guilty. It is not merely that he has
          infirmities or that he is not as good as he ought to be: he has set at
          nothing God&#x27;s authority, violated His commandments, trodden His
          laws under foot. And this is true not only of a certain class of
          offenders, but &quot;all the world&quot; is &quot;guilty before
          God&quot; (Romans 3:19). &quot;There is none righteous, no, not one:
          They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
          unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one&quot; (Romans
          3:10, 12). It is impossible for any man to clear himself from this
          fearful charge. He can neither show that the crimes of which he is
          accused have not been committed, nor that having been committed, he
          had a right to do them. He can neither disprove the charges which the
          law preferred against him, nor justify himself in the perpetration of
          them. Here then is how the case stands. The law demands personal,
          perfect, and perpetual conformity to its precepts, in heart and act,
          in motive and performance. God charges each one of us with having
          failed to meet those just demands, and declares we have violated His
          commandments in thought and word and deed. The law therefore
          pronounces upon us a sentence of condemnation, curses us, and demands
          the infliction of its penalty, which is death. The One before whose
          tribunal we stand is omniscient, and cannot be deceived or imposed
          upon; He is inflexibly just, and swayed by no sentimental
          considerations. We, the accused, are guilty, unable to refute the
          accusations of the law, unable to vindicate our sinful conduct, unable
          to offer any satisfaction or atonement for our crimes. Truly, our case
          is desperate to the last degree. Here, then, is the problem. How can
          God justify the willful transgressor of His law without justifying his
          sins? How can God deliver him from the penalty of His broken law
          without compromising His holiness and going back upon His word that He
          will &quot;by no means clear the guilty&quot;? How can life be granted
          the guilty culprit without repealing the sentence &quot;the soul that
          sins it shall die&quot;? How can mercy be shown to the sinner without
          justice being flouted? It is a problem which must forever have baffled
          every finite intelligence. Yet, blessed be His name, God has, in His
          consummate wisdom, devised a way whereby the &quot;chief of
          sinners&quot; may be dealt with by Him as though he were perfectly
          innocent; nay more, He pronounces him righteous, up to the required
          standard of the law, and entitled to the reward of eternal life. How
          this can be will be explained in the chapter.
