        <h2>Its Basis</h2>
        <p>
          We had previously contemplated the problem which is presented in the
          justifying or pronouncing righteous one who is a flagrant violater of
          the law of God. Some may have been surprised at the introduction of
          such a term as &quot;problem&quot;: as there are many in the ranks of
          the ungodly who feel that the world owes them a living, so there are
          not a few Pharisees in Christendom who suppose it is due them that at
          death their Creator should take them to Heaven. But different far is
          it with one who has been enlightened and convicted by the Holy Spirit,
          so that he sees himself to be a filthy wretch, a vile rebel against
          God. Such an one will ask, seeing that the word of God so plainly
          declares &quot;there shall in no wise enter into it anything that
          defiles, neither whatever works abomination&quot; (Rev. 21:27), how is
          it possible that I can ever gain admission into the Heavenly
          Jerusalem? How can it be that one so completely devoid of
          righteousness as I am, and so filled with unrighteousness, should ever
          be pronounced just by a holy God? Various attempts have been made by
          unbelieving minds to solve this problem. Some have reasoned that if
          they now turn over a new leaf, thoroughly reform their lives and
          henceforth walk in obedience to God&#x27;s law, they shall be approved
          before the divine Tribunal. This scheme, reduced to simple terms, is
          salvation by our own works. But such a scheme is utterly untenable,
          and salvation by such means is absolutely impossible. The works of a
          reformed sinner cannot be the meritorious or efficacious cause of his
          salvation, and that for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, no provision is made for his previous failures. Suppose that
          henceforth I never again transgress God&#x27;s law, what is to atone
          for my past sins?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, a fallen and sinful creature cannot produce that which is
          perfect, and nothing short of perfection is acceptable to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, were it possible for us to be saved by our own works, then the
          sufferings and death of Christ were needless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, salvation by our own merits would entirely eclipse the glory
          of divine grace. Others suppose this problem may be solved by an
          appeal to the bare mercy of God. But mercy is not an attribute that
          overshadows all the other divine perfections: justice, truth, and
          holiness are also operative in the salvation of God&#x27;s elect. The
          law is not set aside, but honored and magnified. The truth of God in
          His solemn threats is not sullied, but faithfully carried out. The
          divine righteousness is not flouted, but vindicated. One of God&#x27;s
          perfections is not exercised to the injury of any of the others, but
          all of them shine forth with equal clearness in the plan which divine
          wisdom devised. Mercy at the expense of justice over-ridden would not
          suit the divine government, and justice enforced to the exclusion of
          mercy would not befit the divine character. The problem which no
          finite intelligence could solve was how both might be exercised in the
          sinner&#x27;s salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A striking example of mercy helpless before the claims of the law
          occurs in Daniel 6. There we find that Darius, the king of Babylon,
          was induced by his nobles to sign a decree that any subject within his
          kingdom who should pray, or &quot;ask a petition of any God or man for
          thirty days&quot; save the king himself, should be cast into the den
          of lions. Daniel knowing this, nevertheless, continued to pray before
          God as hitherto. Whereupon the nobles acquainted Darius with his
          violation of the royal edict, which &quot;according to the law of the
          Medes and Persians alters not,&quot; and demanded his punishment. Now
          Daniel stood high in the king&#x27;s favor, and he greatly desired to
          show clemency unto him, so he &quot;set his heart on Daniel to deliver
          him, and he labored until the going down of the sun to deliver
          him.&quot; But he found no way out of the difficulty: the law must be
          honored, so Daniel was cast into the lion&#x27;s den. An equally
          striking example of law helpless in the presence of mercy is found in
          John 8. There we read of a woman taken in the act of adultery. The
          scribes and Pharisees apprehended her and set her before Christ,
          charging her with the crime, and reminding the Savior that &quot;Moses
          in the law commanded us that such should be stoned.&quot; She was
          unquestionably guilty, and her accusers were determined that the
          penalty of the law should be inflicted upon her. The Lord turned to
          them and said, &quot;He who is without sin among you, let him first
          cast a stone at her&quot;; and they, being convicted by their own
          conscience, went out one by one, leaving the adulteress alone with
          Christ. Turning to her, He asked, &quot;Woman, where are your
          accusers, has no man condemned you?&quot; She replied, &quot;No man,
          Lord,&quot; and He answered, &quot;Neither do I condemn you, go, and
          sin no more.&quot; The two adverse principles are seen operating in
          conjunction in Luke 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;Father&quot; could not have the (prodigal) son at His table
          clad in the rags of the far country, but He could go out and meet him
          in those rags: He could fall on his neck and kiss him in those rags—it
          was blessedly characteristic of His grace so to do; but to seat him at
          His table in garments suited to the swine-troughs would not be
          fitting. But the grace which brought the Father out to the prodigal
          &quot;reigned&quot; through that righteousness which brought the
          prodigal in to the Father&#x27;s house. It had not been
          &quot;grace&quot; had the Father waited until the prodigal decked
          himself out in suitable garments of his own providing; nor would it
          have been &quot;righteousness&quot; to bring him to His table in his
          rags. Both grace and righteousness shone forth in their respective
          beauty when the Father said &quot;bring forth the best robe, and put
          it on him.&quot; It is through Christ and His atonement that the
          justice and mercy of God, His righteousness and grace, meet in the
          justifying of a believing sinner. In Christ is found the solution to
          every problem which sin has raised. In the Cross of Christ every
          attribute of God shines forth in its meridian splendor. In the
          satisfaction which the Redeemer offered unto God every claim of the
          law, whether preceptive or penal, has been fully met. God has been
          infinitely more honored by the obedience of the last Adam than He was
          dishonored by the disobedience of the first Adam. The justice of God
          was infinitely more magnified when its awful sword smote the beloved
          Son, than had every member of the human race burned forever and ever
          in the lake of fire. There is infinitely more efficacy in the blood of
          Christ to cleanse, than there is in sin to befoul. There is infinitely
          more merit in Christ&#x27;s one perfect righteousness than there is
          demerit in the combined unrighteousness of all the ungodly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well may we exclaim, &quot;But God forbid that I should glory, save in
          the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (Galatians 6:14). But while
          many are agreed that the atoning death of Christ is the meritorious
          cause of His peoples&#x27; salvation, there are now few indeed who can
          give any clear Scriptural explanation of the way and manner by which
          the work of Christ secures the justification of all who believe. Hence
          the need for a clear and full statement thereon. Hazy ideas at this
          point are both dishonoring to God and unsettling to our peace. It is
          of first importance that the Christian should obtain a clear
          understanding of the ground on which God pardons his sins and grants
          him a title to the Heavenly inheritance. Perhaps this may best be set
          forth under three words: substitution, identification, imputation. As
          their Surety and Sponsor, Christ entered the place occupied by His
          people under the law, so identifying Himself with them as to be their
          Head and Representative, and as such He assumed and discharged all
          their legal obligations: their liabilities being transferred to Him,
          His merits being transferred to them. The Lord Jesus has wrought out
          for His people a perfect righteousness by obeying the law in thought
          and word and deed, and this righteousness is imputed to them, reckoned
          to their account. The Lord Jesus has suffered the penalty of the law
          in their stead, and through His atoning death they are cleansed from
          all guilt. As creatures they were under obligations to obey Gods&#x27;
          law; as criminals (transgressors) they were under the death-sentence
          of the law. Therefore, to fully meet our liabilities and discharge our
          debts it was necessary that our Substitute should both obey and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shedding of Christ&#x27;s blood blotted out our sins, but it did
          not, of itself, provide the &quot;best robe&quot; for us. To silence
          the accusations of the law against us so that there is now &quot;no
          condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus&quot; is simply a
          negative blessing: something more was required, namely, a positive
          righteousness, the keeping of the law, so that we might be entitled to
          its blessing and reward. In Old Testament times the name under which
          the Messiah and Mediator was foretold is, &quot;THE LORD OUR
          RIGHTEOUSNESS&quot; (Jeremiah 23:6). It was plainly predicted by
          Daniel that He should come here to &quot;finish the transgression, and
          to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and
          to bring in everlasting righteousness&quot; (9:24). Isaiah announced
          &quot;Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
          strength: even to Him shall men come; and all that are incensed
          against Him shall be ashamed. In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel
          be justified, and shall glory&quot; (45:24, 25). And again, he
          represents each of the redeemed exclaiming, &quot;I will greatly
          rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He has
          clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the
          robe of righteousness&quot; (61:10). In Romans 4:6-8 we read,
          &quot;David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
          imputes righteousness without works, Saying, Blessed are they whose
          iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the
          man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.&quot; Here we are shown the
          inseparability of the two things: God imputing
          &quot;righteousness&quot; and God not imputing &quot;sins.&quot; The
          two are never divided: unto whom God imputes not sin He imputes
          righteousness; and unto whom He imputes righteousness, He imputes not
          sin. But the particular point which we are most anxious for the reader
          to grasp is, Whose &quot;righteousness&quot; is it that God imputes or
          reckons to the account of the one who believes?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is, that righteousness which was wrought out by our Surety,
          that obedience to the law which was vicariously rendered by our
          Sponsor, even &quot;the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus
          Christ&quot; (2 Peter 1:1). This righteousness is not only &quot;unto
          all&quot; but also &quot;upon all them that believe&quot; (Romans
          3:22). It is called &quot;the righteousness of God&quot; because it
          was the righteousness of the God-man Mediator, just as in Acts 20:28
          His blood is call the blood of God. The &quot;righteousness of
          God&quot; which is mentioned so frequently in the Roman epistle refers
          not to the essential righteousness of the divine character, for that
          cannot possibly be imputed or legally transferred to any creature.
          When we are told in 10:3 that the Jews were &quot;ignorant of
          God&#x27;s righteousness&quot; it most certainly does not mean they
          were in the dark concerning the divine rectitude or that they knew
          nothing about God&#x27;s justice; but it signifies that they were
          unenlightened as to the righteousness which the God-man Mediator had
          vicariously wrought out for His people. This is abundantly clear from
          the remainder of that verse: &quot;and going about to establish their
          own righteousness&quot;—not their own rectitude or justice, but
          performing works by which they hoped to merit acceptance with God. So
          tightly did they cling to this delusion, they, &quot;submitted not
          themselves unto the righteousness of God&quot;: that is, they refused
          to turn from their self-righteousness and put their trust in the
          obedience and sufferings of the incarnate Son of God. &quot;I would
          explain what we mean by the imputation of Christ&#x27;s righteousness.
          Sometimes the expression is taken by our divines in a larger sense,
          for the imputation of all that Christ did and suffered for our
          redemption whereby we are free from guilt, and stand righteous in the
          sight of God; and so implies the imputation both of Christ&#x27;s
          satisfaction and obedience. But here I intend it in a stricter sense,
          for the imputation of that righteousness or moral goodness that
          consists in the obedience of Christ. And by that obedience being
          imputed to us, is meant no other than this, that that righteousness of
          Christ is accepted for us, and admitted instead of that perfect
          inherent righteousness that ought to be in ourselves: Christ&#x27;s
          perfect obedience shall be reckoned to our account, so that we shall
          have the benefit of it, as though we had performed it ourselves: and
          so we suppose, that a title to eternal life is given us as the reward
          of this righteousness&quot; (Jonathan Edwards). The one passage which
          casts the clearest light upon that aspect of justification which we
          are now considering is 2 Corinthians 5:21, &quot;For He has made Him
          to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in Him.&quot; Here we have the counter
          imputations: of our sins to Christ, of His righteousness to us. As the
          teaching of this verse is of such vital moment let us endeavor to
          consider its terms the more closely. How was Christ &quot;made sin for
          us&quot;?
        </p>
        <p>
          By God imputing to Him our disobedience, or our transgressions of the
          law; in like manner, we are made &quot;the righteousness of God in
          Him&quot; (in Christ, not in ourselves) by God imputing to us
          Christ&#x27;s obedience, His fulfilling the precepts of the law for
          us. As Christ &quot;knew no sin&quot; by inward defilement or personal
          commission, so we &quot;knew&quot; or had no righteousness of our own
          by inward conformity to the law, or by personal obedience to it. As
          Christ was &quot;made sin&quot; by having our sins placed to His
          account or charged upon Him in a judicial way, and as it was not by
          any criminal conduct of His own that He was &quot;made sin,&quot; so
          it is not by any pious activities of our own that we become
          &quot;righteous&quot;: Christ was not &quot;made sin&quot; by the
          infusion of depravity, nor are we &quot;made righteous&quot; by the
          infusion of holiness. Though personally holy, our Sponsor did, by
          entering our law-place, render Himself officially liable to the wrath
          of God; and so though personally unholy, we are, by virtue of our
          legal identification with Christ, entitled to the favor of God. As the
          consequence of Christ&#x27;s being &quot;made sin for us&quot; was,
          that &quot;the LORD laid on Him the iniquity of us all&quot; (Isaiah
          53:6), so the consequence of Christ&#x27;s obedience being reckoned to
          our account is that God lays righteousness &quot;upon all them that
          believe&quot; (Romans 3:22). As our sins were the judicial ground of
          the sufferings of Christ, by which sufferings He satisfied justice; so
          Christ&#x27;s righteousness is the judicial ground of our acceptance
          with God, by which our pardon is an act of justice. Notice carefully
          that in 2 Corinthians 5:21 it is God who &quot;made&quot; or legally
          constituted Christ to be &quot;sin for us,&quot; though as Hebrews
          10:7 shows, the Son gladly acquiesced therein. &quot;He was made sin
          by imputation: the sins of all His people were transferred unto Him,
          laid upon Him, and placed to His account and having them upon Him He
          was treated by the justice of God as if He had been not only a sinner,
          but a mass of sin: for to be made sin is a stronger expression than to
          be made a sinner&quot; (John Gill).
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;That we might be made the righteousness of God in Him&quot;
          signifies to be legally constituted righteous before God—justified.
          &quot;It is a righteousness &#x27;in Him,&#x27; in Christ, and not in
          ourselves, and therefore must mean the righteousness of Christ: so
          called, because it is wrought by Christ, who is God over all, the true
          God, and eternal life&quot; (Ibid.). The same counter-exchange which
          has been before us in 2 Corinthians 5:21 is found again in Galatians
          3:13, 14, &quot;Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law,
          being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
          hangs on a tree: That the blessing of Abraham might come on the
          Gentiles through Jesus Christ.&quot; As the Surety of His people,
          Christ was &quot;made under the law&quot; (Galatians 4:4), stood in
          their law-place and stead, and having all their sins imputed to Him,
          and the law finding them all upon Him, condemned Him for them; and so
          the justice of God delivered Him up to the accursed death of the
          cross. The purpose, as well as the consequence, of this was &quot;That
          the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles&quot;: the
          &quot;blessing of Abraham&quot; (as Romans 4 shows) was justification
          by faith through the righteousness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Upon a Life I did not live, Upon a Death I did not die;</p>
        <p>
          Another&#x27;s death, Another&#x27;s life I&#x27;d rest my soul
          eternally.&quot;
