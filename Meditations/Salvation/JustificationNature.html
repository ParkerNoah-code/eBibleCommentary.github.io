        <h2>Its Nature</h2>
        <p>
          Justification, strictly speaking, consists in God&#x27;s imputing to
          His elect the righteousness of Christ, that alone being the
          meritorious cause or formal ground on which He pronounces them
          righteous: the righteousness of Christ is that to which God has
          respect when He pardons and accepts the sinner. By the nature of
          justification we have reference to the constituent elements of the
          same, which are enjoyed by the believer. These are, the non-imputation
          of guilt or the remission of sins, and second, of the investing of the
          believer with a legal title to Heaven. The alone ground on which God
          forgives any man&#x27;s sins, and admits him into His judicial favor,
          is the vicarious work of his Surety—that perfect satisfaction which
          Christ offered to the law on his behalf. It is of great importance to
          be clear on the fact that Christ was &quot;made under the law&quot;
          not only that He might redeem His people &quot;from the curse of the
          law&quot; (Galatians 3:13), but also that they might &quot;receive the
          adoption of sons&quot; (Galatians 4:4, 5), that is, be invested with
          the privileges of sons. This grand doctrine of justification was
          proclaimed in its purity and clarity by the Reformers—Luther, Calvin,
          Zanchius, Peter Martyr, etc.; but it began to be corrupted in the
          seventeenth century by men who had only a very superficial knowledge
          of it, who taught that justification consisted merely in the removal
          of guilt or forgiveness of sins, excluding the positive admittance of
          man into God&#x27;s judicial favor: in other words, they restricted
          justification unto deliverance from Hell, failing to declare that it
          also conveys a title unto Heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          This error was perpetuated by John Wesley, and then by the Plymouth
          Brethren, who, denying that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to
          the believer, seek to find their title to eternal life in a union with
          Christ in His resurrection. Few today are clear upon the twofold
          content of justification, because few today understand the nature of
          that righteousness which is imputed to all who believe. To show that
          we have not misrepresented the standard teachings of the Plymouth
          Brethren on this subject, we quote from Mr. W. Kelly&#x27;s
          &quot;Notes on Romans.&quot; In his &quot;Introduction&quot; he
          states, &quot;There is nothing to hinder our understanding &#x27;the
          righteousness of God&#x27; in its usual sense of an attribute or
          quality of God&quot; (p. 35). But how could an &quot;attribute&quot;
          or &quot;quality&quot; of God be &quot;upon all them that
          believe&quot; (Romans 3:22)? Mr. Kelly will not at all allow that the
          &quot;righteousness of God&quot; and &quot;the righteousness of
          Christ&quot; are one and the same, and hence, when he comes to Romans
          4 (where so much is said about &quot;righteousness&quot; being imputed
          to the believer) he evacuates the whole of its blessed teaching by
          trying to make out that this is nothing more than our own faith,
          saying of Abraham, &quot;his faith in God&#x27;s word as that which he
          exercised, and which was accounted as righteousness&quot; (p. 47). The
          &quot;righteousness of Christ&quot; which is imputed to the believer
          consists of that perfect obedience which He rendered unto the precepts
          of God&#x27;s law and that death which He died under the penalty of
          the law. It has been rightly said that, &quot;There is the very same
          need of Christ&#x27;s obeying the law in our stead, in order to the
          reward, as of His suffering the penalty of the law in our stead in
          order to our escaping the penalty; and the same reason why one should
          be accepted on our account as the other... To suppose that all Christ
          does in order to make atonement for us by suffering is to make Him our
          Savior but in part. It is to rob Him of half His glory as a Savior.
          For if so, all that He does is to deliver us from Hell; He does not
          purchase Heaven for us&quot; (Jonathan Edwards).
        </p>
        <p>
          Should anyone object to the idea of Christ &quot;purchasing&quot;
          Heaven for His people, he may at once be referred to Ephesians 1:14,
          where Heaven is expressly designated &quot;the purchased
          possession.&quot; The imputation to the believer&#x27;s account of
          that perfect obedience which his Surety rendered unto the law for him
          is plainly taught in Romans 5:18, 19, &quot;Therefore as by the
          offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
          the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
          justification of life. For as by one man&#x27;s disobedience many were
          made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
          righteous.&quot; Here the &quot;offence&quot; or
          &quot;disobedience&quot; of the first Adam is set over against the
          &quot;righteousness&quot; or &quot;obedience&quot; of the last Adam,
          and inasmuch as the disobedience of the former was an actual
          transgression of the law, therefore the obedience of the latter must
          be His active obedience unto the law; otherwise the force of the
          apostle&#x27;s antithesis would fail entirely. As this vital point
          (the chief glory of the gospel) is now so little understood, and in
          some quarters disputed, we must enter into some detail. The one who
          was justified upon his believing sustained a twofold relation unto
          God: first, he was a responsible creature, born under the law; second,
          he was a criminal, having transgressed that law—though his criminality
          has not canceled his obligation to obey the law any more than a man
          who recklessly squanders his money is no longer due to pay his debts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, justification consists of two parts, namely, an
          acquittal from guilt, or the condemnation of the law (deliverance from
          Hell), and the receiving him into God&#x27;s favor, on the sentence of
          the law&#x27;s approval (a legal title to Heaven). And therefore, the
          ground upon which God pronounces him just is also a double one, as the
          one complete satisfaction of Christ is viewed in its two distinct
          parts: namely, His vicarious obedience unto the precepts of the law,
          and His substitutionary death under the penalty of the law, the merits
          of both being equally imputed or reckoned to the account of him who
          believes. Against this it has been objected, &quot;The law requires no
          man to obey and die too.&quot; To which we reply in the language of J.
          Hervey (1750), &quot;But did it not require a transgressor to obey and
          die? If not, then transgression robs the law of its right, and vacates
          all obligation to obedience. Did it not require the Surety for sinful
          men to obey and die? If the Surety dies only, He only delivers from
          penalty. But this affords no claim to life, no title to a
          reward—unless you can produce some such edict from the Court of
          Heaven— &quot;Suffer this, and you shall live.&quot; I find it written
          &#x27;In keeping Your commandments there is great reward&#x27; (Psalm
          19:11), but nowhere do I read, &quot;In undergoing Your curse, there
          is the same reward.&quot; Whereas, when we join the active and passive
          obedience of our Lord—the peace-speaking Blood with the Life-giving
          righteousness—both made infinitely meritorious and infinitely
          efficacious by the divine glory of His person, how full does our
          justification appear! How firm does it stand!&quot; It is not
          sufficient that the believer stand before God with no sins upon
          him—that is merely negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holiness of God requires a positive righteousness to our
          account—that His law be perfectly kept. But we are unable to keep it,
          therefore our Sponsor fulfilled it for us. By the blood-shedding of
          our blessed Substitute the gates of Hell have been forever shut
          against all those for whom He died. By the perfect obedience of our
          blessed Surety the gates of Heaven are opened wide unto all who
          believe. My title for standing before God, not only without fear, but
          in the conscious sunshine of His full favor, is because Christ has
          been made &quot;righteousness&quot; unto me (1 Corinthians 1:30).
          Christ not only paid all my debts, but fully discharged all my
          responsibilities. The law-giver is my law-Fulfiller. Every holy
          aspiration of Christ, every godly thought, every gracious word, every
          righteous act of the Lord Jesus, from Bethlehem to Calvary, unite in
          forming that &quot;best robe&quot; in which the seed royal stand
          arrayed before God. Yet sad to say, even so widely-read and
          generally-respected a writer as the late Sir Rob. Anderson, said in
          his book, &quot;The Gospel and Its Ministry&quot; (Chapter on
          Justification by Blood), &quot;Vicarious obedience is an idea wholly
          beyond reason; how could a God of righteousness and truth reckon a man
          who has broken law to have kept law, because someone else has kept it?
          The thief is not declared to be honest because his neighbor or his
          kinsman is a good citizen.&quot; What a pitiable dragging down to the
          bar of sin-polluted human reason, and a measuring by worldly
          relations, of that divine transaction wherein the &quot;manifold
          wisdom of God&quot; was exercised! What is impossible with men is
          possible with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did Sir Robert never read that Old Testament prediction wherein the
          Most High God declared, &quot;Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do
          a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a
          wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
          understanding of their prudent men shall be hid&quot; (Isaiah 29:14)?
          It is pointed out that, &quot;In the human realm, both innocence and
          righteousness are transferable in their effects, but that in
          themselves they are untransferable.&quot; From this it is argued that
          neither sin nor righteousness are in themselves capable of being
          transferred, and that though God treated Christ as if He were the
          sinner, and deals with the believer as though he were righteous,
          nevertheless, we must not suppose that either is actually the case;
          still less ought we to affirm that Christ deserved to suffer the
          curse, or that His people are entitled to be taken to Heaven. Such is
          a fair sample of the theological ignorance of these degenerate times,
          such is a representative example of how divine things are being
          measured by human standards; by such sophistries is the fundamental
          truth of imputation now being repudiated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rightly did W. Rushton, in his &quot;Particular Redemption,&quot;
          affirm, &quot;In the great affair of our salvation, our God stands
          single and alone. In this most glorious work, there is such a display
          of justice, mercy, wisdom and power, as never entered into the heart
          of man to conceive, and consequently, can have no parallel in the
          actions of mortals. &#x27;Who has declared this from ancient time? who
          has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God
          else beside Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside
          Me&#x27;: Isaiah 45:21.&quot; No, in the very nature of the case no
          analogy whatever is to be found in any human transactions with
          God&#x27;s transferring our sins to Christ or Christ&#x27;s obedience
          to us, for the simple but sufficient reason that no such union exists
          between worldlings as obtains between Christ and His people. But let
          us further amplify this counter-imputation. The afflictions which the
          Lord Jesus experienced were not only sufferings at the hands of men,
          but also enduring punishment at the hand of God: &quot;it pleased the
          LORD to bruise Him&quot; (Isaiah 53:10); &quot;Awake, O sword, against
          My Shepherd, and against the man that is My Fellow, says the LORD of
          hosts: smite the shepherd&quot; (Zechariah 13:7) was His edict.
        </p>
        <p>
          But lawful &quot;punishment&quot; presupposes criminality; a righteous
          God had never inflicted the curse of the law upon Christ unless He had
          deserved it. That is strong language we are well aware, yet not
          stronger than what Holy Writ fully warrants, and things need to be
          stated forcibly and plainly today if an apathetic people is to be
          aroused. It was because God had transferred to their Substitute all
          the sins of His people that, officially, Christ deserved to be paid
          sin&#x27;s wages. The translation of our sins to Christ was clearly
          typed out under the law: &quot;And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon
          the head of the live goat, (expressing identification with the
          substitute), and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
          of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting
          them upon the head of the goat (denoting transference), and shall send
          him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: And the goat
          shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
          inhabited&quot; (Leviticus 16:21, 22). So too it was expressly
          announced by the Prophets: &quot;The LORD has laid on Him the iniquity
          of us all... He shall bear their iniquities&quot; (Isaiah 53:6, 11).
        </p>
        <p>
          In that great Messianic Psalm, the 69th, we hear the Surety saying,
          &quot;O God, You know My foolishness; and My sins are not hid from
          You&quot; (verse 5)—how could the spotless Redeemer speak thus, unless
          the sins of His people had been laid upon Him? When God imputed sin to
          Christ as the sinner&#x27;s Surety, He charged Him with the same, and
          dealt with Him accordingly. Christ could not have suffered in the
          stead of the guilty unless their guilt had been first transferred to
          Him. The sufferings of Christ were penal. God by act of transcendent
          grace (to us) laid the iniquities of all that are saved upon Christ,
          and in consequence, divine justice finding sin upon Him, punished Him.
          He who will by no means clear the guilty must strike through sin and
          smite its bearer, no matter whether it be the sinner himself or One
          who vicariously takes his place. But as G.S. Bishop well said,
          &quot;When justice once strikes the Son of God, justice exhausts
          itself.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The atonement of Christ was contrary to our processes of law because
          it rose above their finite limitations! Now as the sins of him who
          believes were, by God, transferred and imputed to Christ so that God
          regarded and treated Him accordingly—visiting upon Him the curse of
          the law, which is death; even so the obedience or righteousness of
          Christ is, by God, transferred and imputed to the believer so that God
          now regards and deals with him accordingly—bestowing upon him the
          blessing of the law, which is life. And any denial of that fact, no
          matter by whoever made, is a repudiation of the cardinal principle of
          the gospel. &quot;The moment the believing sinner accepts Christ as
          his Substitute, he finds himself not only freed from his sins, but
          rewarded: he gets all Heaven because of the glory and merits of Christ
          (Romans 5:17). The atonement, then, which we preach is one of absolute
          exchange (1 Peter 3:18). It is that Christ took our place literally,
          in order that we might take His place literally—that God regarded and
          treated Christ as the Sinner, and that He regards and treats the
          believing sinner as Christ. &quot;It is not enough for a man to be
          pardoned. He, of course, is then innocent—washed from his sin—put back
          again, like Adam in Eden, just where he was. But that is not enough.
          It was required of Adam in Eden that he should actually keep the
          command. It was not enough that he did not break it, or that he is
          regarded, through the Blood, as though he did not break it. He must
          keep it: he must continue in all things that are written in the book
          of the law to do them. How is this necessity supplied? Man must have a
          righteousness, or God cannot accept him. Man must have a perfect
          obedience, or else God cannot reward him&quot; (G.S. Bishop). That
          necessary and perfect obedience is to be found alone in that perfect
          life, lived by Christ in obedience to the law, before He went to the
          cross, which is reckoned to the believer&#x27;s account.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not that God treats as righteous one who is not actually so
          (that would be a fiction), but that He actually constitutes the
          believer so, not by infusing a holy nature in his heart, but by
          reckoning the obedience of Christ to his account. Christ&#x27;s
          obedience is legally transferred to him so that he is now rightly and
          justly regarded as righteous by the divine law. It is very far more
          than a naked pronouncement of righteousness upon one who is without
          any sufficient foundation for the judgment of God to declare him
          righteous. No, it is a positive and judicial act of God &quot;whereby,
          on the consideration of the mediation of Christ, He makes an effectual
          grant and donation of a true, real, perfect righteousness, even that
          of Christ Himself unto all that do believe, and accounting it as
          theirs, on His own gracious act, both absolves them from sin, and
          grants them right and title unto eternal life&quot; (John Owen). It
          now remains for us to point out the ground on which God acts in this
          counter-imputation of sin to Christ and righteousness to His people.
          That ground was the Everlasting Covenant. The objection that it is
          unjust the innocent should suffer in order that the guilty may escape
          loses all its force once the Covenant-Headship and responsibility of
          Christ is seen, and the covenant-oneness with Him of those whose sins
          He bore. There could have been no such thing as a vicarious sacrifice
          unless there had been some union between Christ and those for whom He
          died, and that relation of union must have subsisted before He died,
          yes, before our sins were imputed to Him. Christ undertook to make
          full satisfaction to the law for His people because He sustained to
          them the relation of a Surety. But what justified His acting as their
          Surety?
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood as their Surety because He was their Substitute: He acted on
          their behalf, because He stood in their room. But what justified the
          substitution? No satisfactory answer can be given to the last question
          until the grand doctrine of everlasting covenant oneness comes into
          view: that is the great underlying relation. The federal oneness
          between the Redeemer and the redeemed, the choosing of them in Christ
          before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4), by which a legal
          union was established between Him and them, is that which alone
          accounts for and justifies all else. &quot;For both He who sanctifies
          and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not
          ashamed to call them brethren&quot; (Hebrews 2:11). As the
          Covenant-Head of His people, Christ was so related to them that their
          responsibilities necessarily became His, and we are so related to Him
          that His merits necessarily become ours. Thus, as we said in an
          earlier chapter, three words give us the key to and sum up the whole
          transaction: substitution, identification, imputation—all of which
          rest upon covenant-oneness. Christ was substituted for us, because He
          is one with us—identified with us, and we with Him. Thus God dealt
          with us as occupying Christ&#x27;s place of worthiness and acceptance.
          May the Holy Spirit grant both writer and reader such an
          heart-apprehension of this wondrous and blessed truth, that
          overflowing gratitude may move us unto fuller devotedness unto Him who
          loved us and gave Himself for us.
