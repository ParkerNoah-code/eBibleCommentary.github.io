        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our first thought was to set forth the principle errors which have
          been entertained upon this subject by different men and parties, but
          after more deliberation we decided this would be for little or no
          profit to the majority of our readers. While there are times, no
          doubt, when it becomes the distasteful duty of God&#x27;s servants to
          expose that which is calculated to deceive and injure His people, yet,
          as a general rule, the most effective way of getting rid of darkness
          is to let in the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          We desire, then, to pen these chapters in the spirit of the godly John
          Owen, who, in the introduction to his ponderous treatise on this theme
          said, &quot;More weight is to be put on the steady guidance of the
          mind and conscience of one believer, really exercised about the
          foundation of his peace and acceptance with God, than on the
          confutation of ten wrangling disputers... To declare and vindicate the
          truth unto the instruction and edification of such as love it in
          sincerity, to extricate their minds from the difficulties in this
          particular instance, which some endeavor to cast on all gospel
          mysteries, to direct the consciences of them that inquire after
          abiding peace with God, and to establish the minds of them that do
          believe, are the things I have aimed at.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a time, not so long ago, when the blessed truth of
          justification was one of the best known doctrines of the Christian
          faith, when it was regularly expounded by the preachers, and when the
          rank and file of churchgoers were familiar with its leading aspects.
          But now, alas, a generation has arisen which is well-near totally
          ignorant of this precious theme, for with very rare exceptions it is
          no longer given a place in the pulpit, nor is scarcely anything
          written thereon in the religious magazines of our day; and, in
          consequence, comparatively few understand what the term itself
          connotes, still less are they clear as to the ground on which God
          justifies the ungodly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This places the writer at a considerable disadvantage, for while he
          wishes to avoid a superficial treatment of so vital a subject, yet to
          go into it deeply, and enter into detail, will make a heavy tax upon
          the mentality and patience of the average person. Nevertheless, we
          respectfully urge each Christian to make a real effort to gird up the
          loins of his mind and seek to prayerfully master these chapters. That
          which will make it harder to follow us through the present series is
          the fact that we are here treating of the doctrinal side of truth,
          rather than the practical; the judicial, rather than the experimental.
          Not that doctrine is impracticable; no indeed; far, far from it.
          &quot;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
          (first) for doctrine, (and then) for reproof, for correction, for
          instruction in righteousness&quot; (2 Timothy 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrinal instruction was ever the foundation from which the apostles
          issued precepts to regulate the walk. Not until the 6th chapter will
          any exhortation be found in the Roman Epistle: the first five are
          devoted entirely to doctrinal exposition. So again in the Epistle to
          the Ephesians: not until 4:1 is the first exhortation given. First the
          saints are reminded of the exceeding riches of God&#x27;s grace, that
          the love of Christ may constrain them; and then they are urged to walk
          worthy of the vocation with which they are called.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it be true that a real mental effort (as well as a prayerful
          heart) is required in order to grasp intelligently some of the finer
          distinctions which are essential to a proper apprehension of this
          doctrine, yet, let it be pointed out that the truth of justification
          is far from being a mere piece of abstract speculation. No, it is a
          statement of divinely revealed fact; it is a statement of fact in
          which every member of our race ought to be deeply interested in. Each
          one of us has forfeited the favor of God, and each one of us needs to
          be restored to His favor. If we are not restored, then the outcome
          must inevitably be our utter ruin and hopeless perdition.
        </p>
        <p>
          How fallen creatures, how guilty rebels, how lost sinners, are
          restored to the favor of God, and given a standing before Him
          inestimably superior to that occupied by the holy angels, will (D.V.)
          engage our attention as we proceed with our subject. As said Abram
          Booth in his splendid work &quot;The Reign of Grace&quot; (written in
          1768), &quot;Far from being a merely speculative point, it spreads its
          influence through the whole body of divinity (theology), runs through
          all Christian experience, and operates in every part of practical
          godliness. Such is its grand importance, that a mistake about it has a
          malignant efficacy, and is attended with a long train of dangerous
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor can this appear strange, when it is considered that this doctrine
          of justification is no other than the way of a sinner&#x27;s
          acceptance with God. Being of such peculiar moment, it is inseparably
          connected with many other evangelical truths, the harmony and beauty
          of which we cannot behold, while this is misunderstood. Until this
          appears in its glory, they will be involved in darkness. It is, if
          anything may be so called, a fundamental article; and certainly
          requires our most serious consideration&quot; (from his chapter on
          &quot;Justification&quot;).
        </p>
        <p>
          The great importance of the doctrine of justification was sublimely
          expressed by the Dutch Puritan, Witsius, when he said,
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
            It tends much to display the glory of God, whose most exalted
            perfections shine forth with an eminent luster in this matter. It
            sets forth the infinite goodness of God, by which He was inclined to
            procure salvation freely for lost and miserable man, &#x27;to the
            praise of the glory of His grace&#x27; (Ephesians 1:6). It displays
            also the strictest justice, by which He would not forgive even the
            smallest offense, but on condition of the sufficient engagement, or
            full satisfaction of the Mediator, &#x27;that He might be just, and
            the Justifier of him which believes in Jesus&#x27; (Rom 3:26). It
            shows further the unsearchable wisdom of the Deity, which found out
            a way for the exercise of the most gracious act of mercy, without
            injury to His strictest justice and infallible truth, which
            threatened death to the sinner: justice demanded that the soul that
            sinned should die (Romans 1:32).
          </p>
          <p>
            Truth had pronounced the curses for not obeying the Lord
            (Deuteronomy 28:15-68). Goodness, in the meantime, was inclined to
            adjudge life to some sinners, but by no other way than what became
            the majesty of the most holy God. Here wisdom interposed, saying,
            &#x27;I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for Mine
            own sake, and will not remember your sins&#x27; (Isaiah 43:25). Nor
            shall you, His justice and His truth have any cause of complaint
            because full satisfaction shall be made to you by a mediator. Hence
            the incredible philanthropy of the Lord Jesus shines forth, who,
            though Lord of all, was made subject to the law, not to the
            obedience of it only, but also to the curse: &#x27;has made Him to
            be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
            righteousness of God in Him&#x27; (2 Corinthians 5:21).
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          Ought not the pious soul, who is deeply engaged in the devout
          meditation of these things, to break out into the praises of a
          justifying God, and sing with the church, &quot;Who is a God like unto
          You, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression&quot;
          (Micah 7:18). O the purity of that holiness which chose rather to
          punish the sins of the elect in His only begotten Son, than suffer
          them to go unpunished!
        </p>
        <p>
          O the abyss of His love to the world, for which He spared not His
          dearest Son, in order to spare sinners! O the depth of the riches of
          unsearchable wisdom, by which He exercises mercy towards the penitent
          guilty, without any stain to the honor of the most impartial Judge! O
          the treasures of love in Christ, whereby He became a curse for us, in
          order to deliver us therefrom! How becoming the justified soul, who is
          ready to dissolve in the sense of this love, with full exultation to
          sing a new song, a song of mutual return of love to a justifying God.
        </p>
        <p>
          So important did the Apostle Paul, under the guidance of the Holy
          Spirit, deem this doctrine, that the very first of his epistles in the
          New Testament is devoted to a full exposition thereof. The pivot on
          which turns the entire contents of the Epistle to the Romans is that
          notable expression &quot;the righteousness of God&quot;—than which is
          none of greater moment to be found in all the pages of Holy Writ, and
          which it behooves every Christian to make the utmost endeavor to
          clearly understand. It is an abstract expression denoting the
          satisfaction of Christ in its relation to the divine law. It is a
          descriptive name for the material cause of the sinner&#x27;s
          acceptance before God. &quot;The righteousness of God&quot; is a
          phrase referring to the finished work of the Mediator as approved by
          the divine tribunal, being the meritorious cause of our acceptance
          before the throne of the Most High.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the succeeding chapters (D.V.) we shall examine in more detail this
          vital expression &quot;the righteousness of God,&quot; which connotes
          that perfect satisfaction which the Redeemer offered to divine justice
          on the behalf of and in the stead of that people which had been given
          to Him. Suffice it now to say that that &quot;righteousness&quot; by
          which the believing sinner is justified is called &quot;the
          righteousness of God&quot; (Rom 1:17; 3:21) because He is the
          appointer, approver, and imputer of it. It is called &quot;the
          righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ&quot; (2 Peter 1:1)
          because He wrought it out and presented it unto God. It is called
          &quot;the righteousness of faith&quot; (Romans 4:13) because faith is
          the apprehender and receiver of it. It is called &quot;man&#x27;s
          righteousness&quot; (Job 33:26) because it was paid for him and
          imputed to him. All these varied expressions refer to so many aspects
          of that one perfect obedience unto death which the Savior performed
          for His people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, so vital did the Apostle Paul, under the guidance of the Holy
          Spirit, esteem this doctrine of justification, that he shows at length
          how the denial and perversion of it by the Jews was the chief reason
          of their being rejected by God: see the closing verses of Romans 9 and
          the beginning of chapter 10. Again; throughout the whole Epistle to
          the Galatians we find the apostle engaged in most strenuously
          defending and zealously disputing with those who had assailed this
          basic truth. Therein he speaks of the contrary doctrine as ruinous and
          fatal to the souls of men, as subversive of the cross of Christ, and
          calls it another gospel, solemnly declaring &quot;though we, or an
          angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you... let him be
          accursed&quot; (Galatians 1:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, that under the latitudinal liberty and false &quot;charity&quot;
          of our day, there is now so little holy abhorrence of that preaching
          which repudiates the vicarious obedience of Christ which is imputed to
          the believer. Under God, the preaching of this grand truth brought
          about the greatest revival which the Cause of Christ has enjoyed since
          the days of the apostles. This was the great fundamental
          distinguishing doctrine of the Reformation, and was regarded by all
          the Reformers as of primary and paramount importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The leading charge which they adduced against the Church of Rome
          was that she had corrupted and perverted the doctrine of Scripture
          upon this subject in a way that was dangerous to the souls of men; and
          it was mainly by the exposition, enforcement, and application of the
          true doctrine of God&#x27;s Word in regard to it, that they assailed
          and overturned the leading doctrines and practices of the Papal
          system. There is no subject which possesses more of intrinsic
          importance than attaches to this one, and there is none with respect
          to which the Reformers were more thoroughly harmonious in their
          sentiments&quot; (W. Cunningham).
        </p>
        <p>
          This blessed doctrine supplies the grand divine cordial to revive one
          whose soul is cast down and whose conscience is distressed by a felt
          sense of sin and guilt, and longs to know the way and means whereby he
          may obtain acceptance with God and the title unto the Heavenly
          inheritance. To one who is deeply convinced that he has been a
          life-long rebel against God, a constant transgressor of His holy law,
          and who realizes he is justly under His condemnation and wrath, no
          inquiry can be of such deep interest and pressing moment as that which
          relates to the means of restoring him to the divine favor, remitting
          his sins, and fitting him to stand unabashed in the divine presence:
          until this vital point has been cleared to the satisfaction of his
          heart, all other information concerning religion will be quite
          unavailing.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Demonstrations of the existence of God will only serve to
          confirm and more deeply impress upon his mind the awful truth which he
          already believes, that there is a righteous Judge, before whom he must
          appear, and by whose sentence his final doom will be fixed. To explain
          the moral law to him, and inculcate the obligations to obey it, will
          be to act the part of a public accuser, when he quotes the statutes of
          the land in order to show that the charges which he has brought
          against the criminal at the bar are well founded, and, consequently,
          that he is worthy of punishment. The stronger the arguments are by
          which you evince the immortality of the soul, the more clearly do you
          prove that his punishment will not be temporary, and that there is
          another state of existence, in which he will be fully recompensed
          according to his desert&quot; (J. Dick).
        </p>
        <p>
          When God Himself becomes a living reality unto the soul, when His
          awful majesty, ineffable holiness, inflexible justice, and sovereign
          authority, are really perceived, even though most inadequately,
          indifference to His claims now gives place to a serious concern. When
          there is a due sense of the greatness of our apostasy from God, of the
          depravity of our nature, of the power and vileness of sin, of the
          spirituality and strictness of the law, and of the everlasting
          burnings awaiting God&#x27;s enemies, the awakened soul cries out,
          &quot;With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
          the high God? shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with
          calves of a year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
          or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for
          my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?&quot;
          (Micah 6:6, 7). Then it is that the poor soul cries out, &quot;How
          then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is
          born of a woman?&quot; (Job 25:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is in the blessed doctrine which is now to be before us that we
          are taught the method whereby a sinner may obtain peace with his Maker
          and rise to the possession of eternal life. Again; this doctrine is of
          inestimable value unto the conscientious Christian who daily groans
          under a sense of his inward corruptions and innumerable failures to
          measure up to the standard which God has set before him. The Devil,
          who is &quot;the accuser of our brethren&quot; (Rev. 12:10),
          frequently charges the believer with hypocrisy before God, disquiets
          his conscience, and seeks to persuade him that his faith and piety are
          nothing but a mask and outward show, by which he has not only imposed
          upon others, but also on himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, thank God, Satan may be overcome by &quot;the blood of the
          Lamb&quot; (Rev. 12:11): by looking away from incurably depraved self,
          and viewing the Surety, who has fully answered for the
          Christian&#x27;s every failure, perfectly atoned for his every sin,
          and brought in an &quot;everlasting righteousness&quot; (Daniel 9:24),
          which is placed to his account in the high court of Heaven. And thus,
          though groaning under his infirmities, the believer may possess a
          victorious confidence which rises above every fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          This it was which brought peace and joy to the heart of the Apostle
          Paul: for while in one breath he cried, &quot;O wretched man that I
          am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&quot; (Romans
          7:24), in the next he declared, &quot;There is therefore now no
          condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus&quot; (Romans 8:1). To
          which he added, &quot;Who shall lay anything to the charge of
          God&#x27;s elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he who condemns? It
          is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at
          the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. Who shall
          separate us from the love of Christ?&quot; (verses 33-35).
        </p>
        <p>
          May it please the God of all grace to so direct our pen and bless what
          we write unto the readers, that not a few who are now found in the
          gloomy dungeons of Doubting Castle, may be brought out into the
          glorious light and liberty of the full assurance of faith.
