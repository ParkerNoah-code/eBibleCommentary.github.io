        <h2>Its Meaning</h2>
        <p>
          Deliverance from the condemning sentence of the divine law is the
          fundamental blessing in divine salvation: so long as we continue under
          the curse, we can neither be holy nor happy. But as to the precise
          nature of that deliverance, as to exactly what it consists of, as to
          the ground on which it is obtained, and as to the means whereby it is
          secured, much confusion now obtains. Most of the errors which have
          been prevalent on this subject arose from the lack of a clear view of
          the thing itself, and until we really understand what justification
          is, we are in no position to either affirm or deny anything concerning
          it. We therefore deem it requisite to devote a whole chapter unto a
          careful defining and explaining this word &quot;justification,&quot;
          endeavoring to show both what it signifies, and what it does not
          connote. Between Protestants and Romanists there is a wide difference
          of opinion as to the meaning of the term &quot;justify&quot;: they
          affirming that to justify is to make inherently righteous and holy; we
          insisting that to justify signifies only to formally pronounce just or
          legally declare righteous. Popery includes under justification the
          renovation of man&#x27;s moral nature or deliverance from depravity,
          thereby confounding justification with regeneration and
          sanctification. On the other hand, all representative Protestants have
          shown that justification refers not to a change of moral character,
          but to a change of legal status; though allowing, yes, insisting, that
          a radical change of character invariably accompanies it. It is a legal
          change from a state of guilt and condemnation to a state of
          forgiveness and acceptance; and this change is owing solely to a
          gratuitous act of God, founded upon the righteousness of Christ (they
          having none of their own) being imputed to His people. &quot;We simply
          explain justification to be an acceptance by which God receives us
          into His favor and esteems us as righteous persons; and we say that it
          consists in the remission of sins and the imputation of the
          righteousness of Christ. . . justification, therefore, is no other
          than an acquittal from guilt of him who was accused, as though his
          innocence has been proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since God, therefore, justifies us through the mediation of Christ, He
          acquits us, not by an admission of our personal innocence, but by an
          imputation of righteousness; so that we, who are unrighteous in
          ourselves, are considered as righteous in Christ&quot; (John Calvin,
          1559). &quot;What is justification? Answer: Justification is an act of
          God&#x27;s free grace unto sinners, in which He pardons all their
          sins, accepts and accounts their persons righteous in His sight; not
          for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the
          perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to
          them, and received by faith alone&quot; (Westminster Catechism, 1643).
          &quot;We thus define the gospel justification of a sinner: It is a
          judicial, but gracious act of God, whereby the elect and believing
          sinner is absolved from the guilt of his sins, and has a right to
          eternal life adjudged to him, on account of the obedience of Christ,
          received by faith&quot; (H. Witsius, 1693). &quot;A person is said to
          be justified when he is approved of God as free from the guilt of sin
          and its deserved punishment; and as having that righteousness
          belonging to him that entitles to the reward of life&quot; (Jonathan
          Edwards, 1750). Justification, then, refers not to any subjective
          change wrought in a person&#x27;s disposition, but is solely an
          objective change in his standing in relation to the law. That to
          justify cannot possibly signify to make a person inherently righteous
          or good is most clearly to be seen from the usage of the term itself
          in Scripture. For example, in Proverbs 17:15 we read, &quot;He who
          justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, even they both are
          abomination to the LORD&quot;: now obviously he who shall make a
          &quot;wicked&quot; person just is far from being an &quot;abomination
          to the LORD,&quot; but he who knowingly pronounces a wicked person to
          be righteous is obnoxious to Him. Again; in Luke 7:29 we read,
          &quot;And all the people that heard Him, and the publicans, justified
          God&quot;: how impossible it is to make the words &quot;justified
          God&quot; signify any moral transformation in His character; but
          understand those words to mean that they declared Him to be righteous,
          and all ambiguity is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, in 1 Timothy 3:16 we are told that the incarnate Son was
          &quot;justified in (or &quot;by&quot;) the Spirit&quot;: that is to
          say, He was publicly vindicated at His resurrection, exonerated from
          the blasphemous charges which the Jews had laid against Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Justification has to do solely with the legal side of salvation. It
          is a judicial term, a word of the law courts. It is the sentence of a
          judge upon a person who has been brought before him for judgment. It
          is that gracious act of God as Judge, in the high court of Heaven, by
          which He pronounces an elect and believing sinner to be freed from the
          penalty of the law, and fully restored unto the divine favor. It is
          the declaration of God that the party arraigned is fully conformed to
          the law; justice exonerates him because justice has been satisfied.
          Thus, justification is that change of status whereby one, who being
          guilty before God, and therefore under the condemning sentence of His
          law, and deserving of nothing but an eternal banishment from His
          presence, is received into His favor and given a right to all the
          blessings which Christ has, by His perfect satisfaction, purchased for
          His people. In substantiation of the above definition, the meaning of
          the term &quot;justify&quot; may be determined, first, by its usage in
          Scripture. &quot;And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what
          shall we speak? or how shall we clear (this Hebrew word
          &quot;tsadaq&quot; always signifies &quot;justify&quot;)
          ourselves?&quot; (Genesis 44:16). Here we have an affair which was
          entirely a judicial one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judah and his brethren were arraigned before the governor of Egypt,
          and they were concerned as to how they might procure a sentence in
          their favor. &quot;If there be a controversy between men, and they
          come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
          justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked&quot; (Deuteronomy
          25:1). Here again we see plainly that the term is a forensic one, used
          in connection with the proceedings of law-courts, implying a process
          of investigation and judgment. God here laid down a rule to govern the
          judges in Israel: they must not &quot;justify&quot; or pass a sentence
          in favor of the wicked: compare 1 Kings 8:31, 32. &quot;If I justify
          myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it
          shall also prove me perverse&quot; (Job 9:20): the first member of
          this sentence is explained in the second—&quot;justify&quot; there
          cannot signify to make holy, but to pronounce a sentence in my own
          favor. &quot;Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu . . . against Job . .
          . because he justified himself rather than God&quot; (Job 32:2), which
          obviously means, because he vindicated himself rather than God.
          &quot;That you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when
          You judge&quot; (Psalm 51:4), which signifies that God, acting in His
          judicial office, might be pronounced righteous in passing sentence.
          &quot;But Wisdom is justified of her children&quot; (Matthew 11:19),
          which means that they who are truly regenerated by God have accounted
          the wisdom of God (which the scribes and Pharisees reckoned
          foolishness) to be, as it really is, consummate wisdom: they cleared
          it of the calumny of folly.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The precise force of the term &quot;to justify&quot; may be
          ascertained by noting that it is the antithesis of &quot;to
          condemn.&quot; Now to condemn is not a process by which a good man is
          made bad, but is the sentence of a judge upon one because he is a
          transgressor of the law. &quot;He who justifies the wicked, and he who
          condemns the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD&quot;
          (Proverbs 17:15 and cf. Deuteronomy 25:1). &quot;For by your words you
          shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned&quot;
          (Matthew 12:37). &quot;It is God that justifies. Who is he who
          condemns?&quot; (Romans 8:33, 34). Now it is undeniable that
          &quot;condemnation&quot; is the passing of a sentence against a person
          by which the punishment prescribed by the law is awarded to him and
          ordered to be inflicted upon him; therefore justification is the
          passing of a sentence in favor of a person, by which the reward
          prescribed by the law is ordered to be given to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That justification is not an experimental change from sin to
          holiness, but a judicial change from guilt to no condemnation may be
          evidenced by the equivalent terms used for it. For example, in Romans
          4:6 we read, &quot;Even as David also describes the blessedness of the
          man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works&quot;: so that
          legal &quot;righteousness&quot; is not a habit infused into the heart,
          but a gift transferred to our account. In Romans 5:9, 10 to be
          &quot;justified by Christ&#x27;s blood&quot; is the same as being
          &quot;reconciled by His death,&quot; and reconciliation is not a
          transformation of character, but the effecting of peace by the removal
          of all that causes offense.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. From the fact that the judicial side of our salvation is propounded
          in Scripture under the figures of a forensic trial and sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;(1) A judgment is supposed in it, concerning which the Psalmist
          prays that it may not proceed on the terms of the law: Psalm 143:2.
        </p>
        <p>(2) The Judge is God Himself: Isaiah 50:7, 8.</p>
        <p>
          (3) The tribunal whereon God sits in judgment is the Throne of Grace:
          Hebrews 4:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) A guilty person. This is the sinner, who is so guilty of sin as to
          be obnoxious to the judgment of God: Romans 3:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) Accusers are ready to propose and promote the charge against the
          guilty person; these are the law (John 5:45), conscience (Romans
          2:15), and Satan: Zechariah 3:2, Revelation 12:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) The charge is admitted and drawn up in a &#x27;handwriting&#x27;
          in form of law, and is laid before the tribunal of the Judge, in bar
          to the deliverance of the offender: Colossians 2:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7) A plea is prepared in the gospel for the guilty person: this is
          grace, through the blood of Christ, the ransom paid, the eternal
          righteousness brought in by the Surety of the covenant: Romans 3:23,
          25, Daniel 9:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8) Hereunto alone the sinner betakes himself, renouncing all other
          apologies of defensatives whatever: Psalm 130:2, 3; Luke 18:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          (9) To make this plea effectual we have an Advocate with the Father,
          and He pleads His own atoning sacrifice for us: 1 John 2:1, 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          (10) The sentence hereon is absolution, on account of the sacrifice
          and righteousness of Christ; with acceptance into favor, as persons
          approved of God: Romans 8:33, 34; 2 Corinthians 5:21&quot; (John
          Owen). From what has been before us, we may perceive what
          justification is not. First, it differs from regeneration. &quot;Whom
          He called, them He also justified&quot; (Romans 8:30).
        </p>
        <p>
          Though inseparably connected, effectual calling or the new birth and
          justification are quite distinct. The one is never apart from the
          other, yet they must not be confounded. In the order of nature
          regeneration precedes justification, though it is in no sense the
          cause or ground of it: none is justified until he believes, and none
          believe until quickened. Regeneration is the act of the Father (James
          1:18), justification is the sentence of the Judge. The one gives me a
          place in God&#x27;s family, the other secures me a standing before His
          throne. The one is internal, being the impartation of divine life to
          my soul: the other is external, being the imputation of Christ&#x27;s
          obedience to my account. By the one I am drawn to return in penitence
          to the Father&#x27;s house, by the other I am given the &quot;best
          robe&quot; which fits me for His presence. Second, it differs from
          sanctification. Sanctification is moral or experimental, justification
          is legal or judicial. Sanctification results from the operation of the
          Spirit in me, justification is based upon what Christ has done for me.
          The one is gradual and progressive, the other is instantaneous and
          immutable. The one admits of degrees, and is never perfect in this
          life; the other is complete and admits of no addition. The one
          concerns my state, the other has to do with my standing before God.
          Sanctification produces a moral transformation of character,
          justification is a change of legal status: it is a change from guilt
          and condemnation to forgiveness and acceptance, and this solely by a
          gratuitous act of God, founded upon the imputation of Christ&#x27;s
          righteousness, through the instrument of faith alone. Though
          justification is quite separate from sanctification, yet
          sanctification ever accompanies it. Third, it differs from
          forgiveness. In some things they agree. It is only God who can forgive
          sins (Mark 2:7) and He alone can justify (Romans 3:30). His free grace
          is the sole moving cause in the one (Ephesians 1:7) and of the other
          (Romans 3:24). The blood of Christ is the procuring cause of each
          alike (Matthew 26:28, Romans 5:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          The objects are the same: the persons that are pardoned are justified,
          and the same that are justified are pardoned; to whom God imputes the
          righteousness of Christ for their justification to them He gives the
          remission of sins; and to whom He does not impute sin, but forgives
          it, to them He imputes righteousness without works: (Romans 4:6-8).
          Both are received by faith (Acts 26:18; Romans 5:1). But though they
          agree in these things, in others they differ. God is said to be
          &quot;justified&quot; (Romans 3:4), but it would be blasphemy to speak
          of Him being &quot;pardoned&quot;—this at once shows the two things
          are diverse. A criminal may be pardoned, but only a righteous person
          can truly be justified. Forgiveness deals only with a man&#x27;s acts,
          justification with the man himself. Forgiveness respects the claims of
          mercy, justification those of justice. Pardon only remits the curse
          due unto sin; in addition justification confers a title to Heaven.
          Justification applies to the believer with respect to the claims of
          the law, pardon with respect to the Author of the law. The law does
          not pardon, for it knows no relaxation; but God pardons the
          transgressions of the law in His people by providing a satisfaction to
          the law adequate to their transgressions. The blood of Christ was
          sufficient to procure pardon (Ephesians 1:7), but His righteousness is
          needed for justification (Romans 5:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pardon takes away the filthy garments, but justification provides a
          change of clothing (Zechariah 3:4). Pardon frees from death (2 Samuel
          12:13), but righteousness imputed is called &quot;justification of
          life&quot; (Romans 5:18). The one views the believer as completely
          sinful, the other as completely righteous. Pardon is the remission of
          punishment, justification is the declaration that no ground for the
          infliction of punishment exists. Forgiveness may be repeated unto
          seventy times seven, justification is once for all. From what has been
          said in the last paragraph we may see what a serious mistake it is to
          limit justification to the mere forgiveness of sins. Just as
          &quot;condemnation&quot; is not the execution of punishment, but
          rather the formal declaration that the accused is guilty and worthy of
          punishment; so &quot;justification&quot; is not merely the remission
          of punishment but the judicial announcement that punishment cannot be
          justly inflicted—the accused being fully conformed to all the positive
          requirements of the law in consequence of Christ&#x27;s perfect
          obedience being legally reckoned to his account. The justification of
          a believer is no other than his being admitted to participate in the
          reward merited by his Surety. Justification is nothing more or less
          than the righteousness of Christ being imputed to us: the negative
          blessing issuing therefrom is the remission of sins; the positive, a
          title to the Heavenly inheritance. Beautifully has it been pointed out
          that &quot;We cannot separate from Immanuel His own essential
          excellency. We may see Him bruised and given like beaten incense to
          the fire, but was incense ever burned without fragrance, and only
          fragrance being the result?
        </p>
        <p>
          The name of Christ not only cancels sin, it supplies in the place of
          that which it has canceled, its own everlasting excellency. We cannot
          have its nullifying power only; the other is the sure concomitant. So
          was it with every typical sacrifice of the law. It was stricken: but
          as being spotless it was burned on the altar for a sweet-smelling
          savor. The savor ascended as a memorial before God: it was accepted
          for, and its value was attributed or imputed to him who had brought
          the vicarious victim. If therefore, we reject the imputation of
          righteousness, we reject sacrifice as revealed in Scripture; for
          Scripture knows of no sacrifice whose efficacy is so exhausted in the
          removal of guilt as to leave nothing to be presented in acceptableness
          before God&quot; (B.W. Newton). &quot;What is placing our
          righteousness in the obedience of Christ, but asserting that we are
          accounted righteous only because His obedience is accepted for us as
          if it were our own? Wherefore Ambrose appears to me to have very
          beautifully exemplified this righteousness in the blessing of Jacob:
          that as he, who had on his own account no claim to the privileges of
          primogeniture, being concealed in his brother&#x27;s habit, and
          invested with his garment, which diffused a most excellent odor,
          insinuated himself into the favor of his father, that he might receive
          the blessing to his own advantage, under the character of another; so
          we shelter ourselves under the precious purity of Christ&quot; (John
          Calvin).
