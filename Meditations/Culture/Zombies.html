        <h2>The Living Dead</h2>
        <p>
          Zombies have long captured the popular imagination as gruesome,
          reanimated corpses, driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh.
          They emerge from the dead, often through supernatural or scientific
          means, but their reanimation is far from the hope and glory that
          Christian resurrection symbolizes. Instead zombies rise as soulless,
          relentless, and remorseless creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prevelance of the zombie mythos in our culture is a symptom of a
          larger breakdown in personal, social, political, and religious domains
          of life. It demonstrates the self-awareness that the modern western
          worldview is bankrupt. There is a realization that we are the
          <em>living dead</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resurrection is the counter-narrative our society needs to hear. The
          resurrection signifies the triumph of life over sin, death, and
          suffering. It is a message of hope, renewal, and transformation.
        </p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          Zombies have evolved from supernatural slaves in Haitian folklore to
          symbols of various modern anxieties, consistently serving as a
          powerful metaphor for societal fears and concerns. The versatility of
          the zombie narrative allows it to continually adapt, reflecting the
          evolving fears and anxieties of different eras.
        </p>
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>
          The modern concept of zombies traces its roots to Haitian Vodou
          beliefs. In Haitian folklore, zombies are dead bodies reanimated
          through magical means by a bokor (sorcerer). This concept, deeply
          embedded in the Haitian culture, likely emerged from the traumatic
          experience of West African slaves who were forcibly brought to Haiti.
          For them, the zombie symbolized the ultimate horror: a life of endless
          enslavement, even in death. This notion of a zombie represents not
          just the fear of death, but a fear of losing one's autonomy and being
          trapped in a state of living death, a poignant metaphor for the
          enslaved peoples' experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          As these beliefs mingled with similar narratives from the indigenous
          Taino people and other Caribbean cultures, a unique tapestry of the
          undead was woven that would capture the Western imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of zombies entered Western popular culture in the early
          20th century, mainly through anthropological studies of Haitian
          culture and beliefs. The idea was sensationalized in the United States
          and Europe, reflecting fears of the unknown and the 'other'.
        </p>
        <h2>TV Shows and Movies</h2>
        <p>
          Zombies began to appear in American cinema, with films like "White
          Zombie" (1932) portraying zombies in line with Haitian folklore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film "Night of the Living Dead" (1968), directed by George Romero,
          revolutionized the zombie genre. It portrayed zombies as flesh-eating
          creatures and introduced themes of societal collapse and human
          survival. Romero's sequels, like "Dawn of the Dead" (1978), continued
          to shape the genre, often using zombies as metaphors for consumerism,
          class conflict, and other social issues. These films reflect the Cold
          War era anxieties about dehumanization and societal collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The zombie genre diversified with films like "28 Days Later" (2002),
          introducing faster, more aggressive zombies, and "World War Z" (2013),
          showcasing a global pandemic scenario. These films reflect modern
          concerns about pandemics, consumerism, and societal unrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Walking Dead" (2010-Present): This TV series, based on a comic
          book, became a cultural phenomenon, exploring complex human
          relationships and moral dilemmas in a post-apocalyptic world overrun
          by zombies.
        </p>
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          Resident Evil Series (1996-Present) and the subsequent film
          adaptations, were influential in popularizing zombies in the realm of
          interactive entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Left 4 Dead Series (2008-Present) focused on cooperative gameplay,
          these games emphasized survival against hordes of zombies.
        </p>
        <h2>Novels</h2>
        <p>
          "World War Z" by Max Brooks (2006) presented a global perspective on a
          zombie apocalypse, later adapted into a film.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" by Seth Grahame-Smith (2009)
          combined Jane Austen's classic with zombie elements, highlighting the
          genre's versatility.

        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Separation from God: Zombies are the <em>living dead</em>, individuals
          disconnected from their humanity. Similarly, Western culture's
          increasing secularism, materialism, and individualism has led to a
          spiritual separation from God and a "zombie-like" existence in which
          people are focused on the superficial and material aspects of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loss of Humanity: Zombies are stripped of their humanity, reduced to
          mindless, decaying shells that act purely on instinct. They are
          neither good nor evil despite looking human because they lack normal
          characteristics of people. This is very similar to the myth of
          naturalism which says that humans are just slightly evolved apes who
          are controlled by impersonal, mechanistic processes. The result in
          both cases is dehumanization and relativism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eternal Damnation: Zombies are cursed to wander the earth and forever
          denied the peace and grace that resurrection offers. The narrative of
          our time is that all is meaningless. There is no ultimate renewal or
          redemption. There is only death, extinction, and the void in the
          future. This view ultimately can only hold out a secular version of
          hell with no chance of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumerism and Materialism: Western culture is characterized by
          excessive consumerism and materialism, which can be seen as a symptom
          of a spiritual emptiness. Zombies mindlessly pursue their next meal,
          brains, just like the constant pursuit of material goods and wealth in
          modern society. Like the zombie, we are never satisfied with material
          possessions because our real problem is spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individualism: Zombies exist as solitary, mindless creatures. Though
          living in a "community," zombies don't know each other and never
          communicate or work together for a common goal. Similarly, the
          survivors fighting against the zombies usually don't care about anyone
          else. Sometimes they are with a small group if it is useful, but they
          will soon leave them for dead if their lives are at risk. This is
          antithetical to the Kingdom of God where God's people are a community
          working together under one King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of Purpose: Zombies exist without a clear purpose. They do things
          on instinct, but they have no meaning. There is nothing objectively
          good or bad for a zombie. This same attitude has led to a widespread
          physical and spiritual malaise in our culture. Many struggle to find
          meaning in their daily lives, turning to various distractions like
          drugs, alcohol, video games, sexual content, and social media to try
          to fill the void. Instead, true purpose is found through being in a
          right relationship with God and realizing that each of us play a role
          in God's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moral Decay: Humans are created in the image of God, making human life
          sacred. Zombies lack a sense of right and wrong and eat humans without
          a second thought. They destroy the sacred with animal carnality, and
          we find that appalling. Likewise, Christianity has been set aside by a
          large portion of our society, but people are still appalled when they
          see the resulting zombie like actions that result such as serial
          killers, wars, and cults. This shouldn't come as a suprise to
          Christians. The Bible explains the sinfulness of the human heart, and
          the only cure is found by turning to the living God who forgives and
          transforms us.
