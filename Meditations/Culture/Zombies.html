        <h2>The Living Dead</h2>
        <p>
          Zombies have long captured the popular imagination as gruesome,
          reanimated corpses, driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh.
          They emerge from the dead, often through supernatural or scientific
          means, but their reanimation is far from the hope and glory that
          Christian resurrection symbolizes. Instead zombies rise as soulless,
          relentless, and remorseless creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prevelance of the zombie mythos in our culture is a symptom of a
          larger breakdown in personal, social, political, and religious domains
          of life. It demonstrates the self-awareness that the modern western
          worldview is bankrupt. There is a realization that we are the
          <em>living dead</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resurrection is the counter-narrative our society needs to hear. The
          resurrection signifies the triumph of life over sin, death, and
          suffering. It is a message of hope, renewal, and transformation.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Separation from God: Zombies are the <em>living dead</em>, individuals
          disconnected from their humanity. Similarly, Western culture's
          increasing secularism, materialism, and individualism has led to a
          spiritual separation from God and a "zombie-like" existence in which
          people are focused on the superficial and material aspects of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loss of Humanity: Zombies are stripped of their humanity, reduced to
          mindless, decaying shells that act purely on instinct. They are
          neither good nor evil despite looking human because they lack normal
          characteristics of people. This is very similar to the myth of
          naturalism which says that humans are just slightly evolved apes who
          are controlled by impersonal, mechanistic processes. The result in
          both cases is dehumanization and relativism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eternal Damnation: Zombies are cursed to wander the earth and forever
          denied the peace and grace that resurrection offers. The narrative of
          our time is that all is meaningless. There is no ultimate renewal or
          redemption. There is only death, extinction, and the void in the
          future. This view ultimately can only hold out a secular version of
          hell with no chance of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumerism and Materialism: Western culture is characterized by
          excessive consumerism and materialism, which can be seen as a symptom
          of a spiritual emptiness. Zombies mindlessly pursue their next meal,
          brains, just like the constant pursuit of material goods and wealth in
          modern society. Like the zombie, we are never satisfied with material
          possessions because our real problem is spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individualism: Zombies exist as solitary, mindless creatures. Though
          living in a "community," zombies don't know each other and never
          communicate or work together for a common goal. Similarly, the
          survivors fighting against the zombies usually don't care about anyone
          else. Sometimes they are with a small group if it is useful, but they
          will soon leave them for dead if their lives are at risk. This is
          antithetical to the Kingdom of God where God's people are a community
          working together under one King.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of Purpose: Zombies exist without a clear purpose. They do things
          on instinct, but they have no meaning. There is nothing objectively
          good or bad for a zombie. This same attitude has led to a widespread
          physical and spiritual malaise in our culture. Many struggle to find
          meaning in their daily lives, turning to various distractions like
          drugs, alcohol, video games, sexual content, and social media to try
          to fill the void. Instead, true purpose is found through being in a
          right relationship with God and realizing that each of us play a role
          in God's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moral Decay: Humans are created in the image of God, making human life
          sacred. Zombies lack a sense of right and wrong and eat humans without
          a second thought. They destroy the sacred with animal carnality, and
          we find that appalling. Likewise, Christianity has been set aside by a
          large portion of our society, but people are still appalled when they
          see the resulting zombie like actions that result such as serial
          killers, wars, and cults. This shouldn't come as a suprise to
          Christians. The Bible explains the sinfulness of the human heart, and
          the only cure is found by turning to the living God who forgives and
          transforms us.
