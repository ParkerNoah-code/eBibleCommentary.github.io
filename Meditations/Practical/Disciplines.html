        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          There are certain teachers who focus a lot on spiritual disciplines
          that I want to address. The movement they are part of has been called
          the Emergent Church or the contemplative prayer movement. A common
          theme in their teaching is a focus on less important or even
          unbiblical practices/ideas along with a severe downplaying of biblical
          truths. The result is turning Christianity into a self-help program or
          mystical experience rather than faith grounded in the saving work of
          Christ unto the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know enough about each individual, so I don't want to make a
          blanket statement that every individual I address here is a heretic.
          However, I do see a problem with the direction, focus, and content of
          much of this movement, so I want to bring the Bible to bear on this
          topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand where this movement stands, it's helpful to consider
          influences and parallels. Much of what is taught is drawn from Roman
          Catholic mysticism. There is a clear New Age bent with a focus on
          feelings, meditation, and the subjective experience with a rejection
          of the importance of theology, which is very Eastern (e.g. Buddhism,
          Hinduism, Taoism, Eastern Orthodoxy). It has a very humanistic view of
          the self, a pelagian model of human failure, and an Arminian view of
          salvation (with universalistic tendencies). There are clear
          connections to Mormon and Quaker theology which teach an inner light
          or feeling to confirm their ideas.

        <h2>Cooperating with God's Grace</h2>
        <p>
          The relationship between sanctification, grace, and Scripture is often
          misunderstood, particularly when teachings emphasize a cooperative
          effort where God does His part and we do ours. This misconception
          places undue focus on spiritual disciplines as the primary driver of
          spiritual growth, suggesting that our efforts play a central role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanctification is fundamentally the work of God through the Holy
          Spirit, as Philippians 2:13 reminds us: "For it is God who works in
          you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure." The danger of
          overemphasizing human effort is that it risks divorcing sanctification
          from God's grace and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit,
          leading to a works-based understanding that diminishes God's role in
          the process.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Another significant concern is the overreliance on personal experience
          or "Christian teaching" that is not grounded in Scripture. Some
          teachers claim biblical authority without proper engagement with the
          text, substituting subjective experience or esoteric ideas for sound
          exegesis. This approach elevates feelings and experiences above the
          revealed truth of God's Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sufficiency of Scripture is undermined when theology is neglected,
          and personal interpretation takes precedence. The result is a shallow
          understanding of faith, where the pursuit of intimacy with God becomes
          an emotional or mystical endeavor detached from biblical foundations.
          Scripture clearly warns against such tendencies, emphasizing that
          sanctification comes through truth: "Sanctify them in the truth; your
          word is truth" (Jn 17:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          This mysticism often manifests in teaching, either explicitly or
          implicitly, that Scripture, prayer, and fellowship are insufficient
          for intimacy with God. Instead, it promotes spiritual disciplines as a
          way to access deeper knowledge or experiences. Such approaches
          resemble Gnostic ideas, where hidden knowledge or special experiences
          are prioritized over revealed truth.
        </p>
        <h2>Sanctification</h2>
        <p>
          Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation and sanctification are gifts
          of grace, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. Romans
          3:23-26 reminds us that justification and sanctification are the
          result of God's work through Christ, not our own efforts. Similarly,
          Romans 6:22 describes sanctification as the fruit of being set free
          from sin and becoming slaves to God, leading to eternal life. These
          truths highlight the centrality of God's work in sanctification,
          leaving no room for self-reliance or the pursuit of mystical
          experiences as a means to spiritual maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While disciplines like prayer and meditation, when properly
          understood, are used by God to grow believers, they are not
          substitutes for the transformative power of God's Word and Spirit. We
          must constantly look to and rely on God for every good thing.
        </p>
        <h2>Theology</h2>
        <p>
          A key danger in these teachings is their detachment of discipleship
          from sound theology. Discipleship without theological grounding leads
          to a directionless pursuit of spiritual growth, often driven by
          feelings rather than truth. Theology provides the reason and direction
          for following Christ, shaping the way we pray, serve, and grow
          spiritually. Paul's letters consistently begin with theological truths
          which then inform Christian living. Without a strong theological
          foundation, Christians risk being led astray, mistaking emotional
          highs for spiritual maturity. True growth glorifies God when it is
          rooted in His Word and shaped by sound doctrine.
        </p>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          Another troubling aspect of these teachings is the way they are
          presented. They are often delivered in a soft, appealing tone. You're
          told to write things down as if they were profound. A lot of times
          they give a loose paraphrase of Scripture which gives the illusion of
          biblical grounding. This disarms listeners, making them less critical
          of what is being taught. However, the teachings often mischaracterize
          opposing positions, rely on emotional appeals, and lack serious
          engagement with Scripture. Such approaches may seem harmless to
          someone not listening carefully, but they fail to glorify God, as they
          are neither Christ-centered nor biblically faithful.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, discipleship must be firmly anchored in Scripture to
          glorify God. Any attempt to grow in sanctification apart from God's
          Word and Spirit leads to self-reliance and distorts the gospel. True
          discipleship and teaching should equip believers with sound doctrine
          and guide them into a deeper relationship with Christ, not lead to
          chasing after emotional highs or mystical experiences. True
          sanctification is God's work, accomplished by His grace, through the
          power of the Holy Spirit, for His glory.
        </p>
        <section style="display: none">
          <h2>[Notes below]</h2>
          <p>
            There's a notion that we cooperate with the grace of God. God does
            His part while we do ours. Our spiritual state and maturation depend
            on the work we put in, the spiritual disciplines we do. Ultimately,
            it's teaching us to discipline ourselves according to the flesh (Col
            2), not in a God-honoring, Christ-centered, biblical way. It is not
            glorifying to God. It's divorcing sanctification from the grace of
            God and the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, and putting it
            primarily into our hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a lot of claiming things on the authority of Scripture that
            Scripture never actually says. There is no teaching of what the
            Bible says because none of the teaching is grounded in the Word of
            God. Experience and "Christian teaching" is relied upon above
            Scripture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phrases such as, "Westerners believe such and such but this is true
            instead" are used. This is very similar to the way progressive
            Christians utilize language. Positions different from their own are
            frequently mischaracterized. There is never any serious analysis of
            a text of Scripture. If you believe something different, well it
            wasn't very important anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is that Scripture is insufficient. We need more intimacy
            with God than we can get through Scripture, regular prayer, and
            fellowship. That's why we need spiritual disciplines. It's chasing
            after an experience or feeling. That's why it's esoteric, gnostic,
            and mystical. It's beyond facts, truths, propositions, and
            knowledge, so those things aren't very important anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theology should inform our prayer life and our discipleship. A
            Christian should want to be a disciple of Christ, but when you
            detach that from theology, you lead people astray. You aren't
            growing closer to God, growing spiritually, or glorifying God when
            you separate them. Being a biblically-grounded Christian gives us a
            foundation, reason and direction for being a disciple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrast this with the teaching of Paul: "For by grace you have been
            saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift
            of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Eph
            2:8-9). "It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so
            that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in
            Jesus" (Rom 3:23).
          </p>
          <p>
            "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves
            of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end,
            eternal life" (Rom 6:22).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't get sin right, you aren't talking about anything that's
            worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to provide discipleship resources and guidance for
            Christians, but it is done without proper recourse to the Bible.
            That is completely unacceptable for a Christian.
          </p>
          <p>
            These teachers tend to speak in a soft voice. It sounds good. Nobody
            is really thinking about what they are saying. But the teaching is
            presented in such a way that it doesn't sound concerning. Maybe it's
            given with a laugh, a smile, or you're told to write it down. And
            they read a verse with it too or at least loosely paraphrase one, so
            the assumption is that it must be biblical, never mind the fact that
            what they said was nowhere to be found in the verse.
